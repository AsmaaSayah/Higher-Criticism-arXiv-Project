On the other hand, by taking the phonon momentum transfer cut-off\nQ_c as an adjustable parameter, as has been frequently exploited in the\nliterature, all the considered potentials can produce agreement with\nexperiments by varying Q_c. The magnitudes of such best fit Q_c values are\ncompared with those available in the literature and their physical significance\nis discussed.",

In all cases, recent\nadvances in understanding have been achieved through the use of state of the\nart stellar dynamical and gas dynamical calculations, combined with the\npossibility of intercomparison with an increasingly large dataset on young\nclusters. Among the subjects that are highlighted are the frequency of\ncluster-mode star formation, the possible relationship between cluster density\nand the highest stellar mass, subclustering and the dynamical interactions that\noccur in compact aggregates, such as binary star formation. We also consider\nhow the spectrum of stellar masses may be shaped by the process of competitive\naccretion in dense environments and how cluster properties, such as mass\nsegregation and cluster morphology, can be used in conjunction with numerical\nsimulations to investigate the initial conditions for cluster formation.\nLastly, we contrast bottom-up and top-down scenarios for cluster formation and\ndiscuss their applicability to the formation of clusters on a range of scales.",

Since different\npulsation modes were suspected among Cepheids, an independent confirmation was\nsearched for. To do that we applied the least-squares technique to Double Mode\nCepheids. By obtaining a very satisfactory description of their pulsational\ncontent (Sect.4), we could confirm that between Cepheids with P<8d they are\nboth fundamental and first overtone pulsators (Sect.5). The detection of small\namplitude cross-coupling terms and higher harmonics in the light curves of\nDouble Mode Cepheids allowed us to quantify the properties of the high-order\nterms and hence to discover other peculiarities (Sect.6), very useful to\ncomplete the scenario of the resonance effects and to test some theoretical\nmodels (Sect.7).

We\nuse these results to build a realistic class of models where the non-decoupling\neffects of ultra-heavy vectorlike matter fields eliminate the tachyons. These\nmodels have a flavor invariant superspectrum similar to that of gauge mediated\nmodels.

The\nellipsoidal variations of the secondary star were modeled and subtracted from\nthe data. The resulting light curve shows a pronounced double-hump variation.\nThe double-hump profile resembles those seen in the light curves of WZ Sge and\nAL Com and likely originates in the accretion disk. The primary eclipse was\nmodeled using maximum entropy disk mapping techniques. The accretion disk has a\nflat intensity distribution and a cool brightness temperature (Tbr=3000 K) in\nthe near-infrared. Superimposed on the face of the disk is the bright spot\n(Tbr=10,000 K); the position of the bright spot is different from the observed\nrange of visible bright spot positions. The near-infrared accretion disk flux\nis dominated by optically thin emission. The secondary eclipse indicates the\npresence of some occulting medium in the disk, but the eclipse depth is too\nshallow to be caused by a fully opaque accretion disk.",

We consider both a uniform H I distribution\nand a two-phase (cloud/intercloud) model, with a negligible filling factor of\nhot gas. We find that the shells of the expanding superbubbles quickly trap or\nattenuate the ionizing flux, so that most of the escaping radiation escapes\nshortly after the formation of the superbubble. For the coeval star-formation\nhistory, the total fraction of Lyman Continuum photons that escape both sides\nof the disk in the solar vicinity is f_esc approx 0.15 +/- 0.05. For the\nGaussian star formation history, f_esc approx 0.06 +/- 0.03, a value roughly a\nfactor of two lower than the results of Dove & Shull (1994), where superbubbles\nwere not considered. For a local production rate of ionizing photons Psi_LyC =\n4.95 X 10^7 cm^{-2} s^{-1}, the flux escaping the disk is Phi_LyC approx\n(1.5-3.0) X 10^6 cm^{-2} s^{-1} for coeval and Gaussian star formation,\ncomparable to the flux required to sustain the Reynolds layer.",

Of the three HII regions, only NGC 5461 had previously been detected in\nCO emission.\n  We calculate preliminary values for the molecular mass of the GMCs in NGC\n5461 by assuming a CO-to-H_2 factor (X factor) and then compare these values\nwith the virial masses. We conclude that the data in this paper demonstrate for\nthe first time that the value of X may decrease in regions with intense star\nformation.\n  The molecular mass for the association of clouds in NGC 5461 is approximately\n3x10^7 Mo and is accompanied by 1-2 times as much atomic mass. The observed CO\nemission in NGC 5461 is an order of magnitude stronger than in NGC 5462, while\nit was not possible to detect molecular gas toward NGC 5471 with the JCMT. An\neven larger ratio of atomic to molecular gas in NGC 5471 was observed, which\nmight be attributed to efficient conversion of molecular to atomic gas.\n  The masses of the individual clouds in NGC 5461, which are gravitationally\nbound, cover a range of (2-8) x 10^5 Mo, comparable with the masses of Galactic\ngiant molecular clouds (GMCs). Higher star forming efficiencies, and not\nmassive clouds, appear to be the prerequisite for the formation of the large\nnumber of stars whose radiation is required to produce the giant HII regions in\nM101.",

As exotic manifolds are not diffeomorphic, one can argue\nthat quantum amplitudes for gravity formulated as functional integrals should\ninclude a sum over not only physically distinct geometries and topologies but\nalso inequivalent differentiable structures. But can the inclusion of exotic\nmanifolds in such sums make a significant contribution to these quantum\namplitudes? This paper will demonstrate that it will. Simply connected exotic\nEinstein manifolds with positive curvature exist in seven dimensions. Their\nmetrics are found numerically; they are shown to have volumes of the same order\nof magnitude. Their contribution to the semiclassical evaluation of the\npartition function for Euclidean quantum gravity in seven dimensions is\nevaluated and found to be nontrivial.

The UVB at energies below 13.6eV suppresses the formation of\nstars or black holes inside small halos, by photo-dissociating their only\ncooling agent, molecular H2. We self-consistently compute the buildup of the\nearly UVB in Press-Schechter models, coupled with H2 photo-dissociation both in\nthe intergalactic medium (IGM), and inside virialized halos. We find that the\nintergalactic H2 has a negligible effect on the UVB, both because its initial\noptical depth is small (tau<0.1), and because it is photo-dissociated at an\nearly stage. If the UV sources in the first collapsed halos are stars, then\ntheir UV flux suppresses further star-formation inside small halos. This\nresults in a pause in the buildup of the UVB, and reionization is delayed until\nlarger halos (T_vir> 10^4 K) collapse. If the small halos host mini-quasars\nwith hard spectra extending to approximately 1 keV, then their X-rays balance\nthe effects of the UVB, the negative feedback does not occur, and reionization\ncan be caused by the small halos.",

    "summary": "The search operation for a marked state by means of Grover's quantum\nsearching algorithm is shown to be an element of group SU(2) which acts on a\n2-dimensional space spanned by the marked state and the unmarked collective\nstate. Based on this underlying structure, those exact bounds of the steps in\nvarious quantum search algorithms are obtained in a quite concise way. This\nreformulation of the quantum searching algorithm also enables a detailed\nanalysis of the decoherence effects caused by its coupling with an environment.\nIt turns out that the environment will not only make the quantum search invalid\nin case of complete decoherence, where the probability of finding the marked\nstate is unchanged, but also it may make the quantum search algorithm worse\nthan expected: It will decrease this probability when the environment shows its\nquantum feature.",

It is found that the Josephson current induces localized\nstates of electron excitations in the vicinity of the tunnel barrier, which are\na continuous analog of Andreev levels in a ballistic junction. The depth of the\ncorresponding ``potential well'' is much greater than the separation between an\nAndreev level and the continuous energy spectrum boundary for the same\ntransmissivity of the barrier. In contrast to a ballistic junction in which the\nJosephson current is transported completely by localized excitations, the\ncontribution to current in a diffusive junction comes from whole spectral\nregion near the energy gap boundary, where the density of states differs\nconsiderably from its unperturbed value. The correction to the Josephson\ncurrent in the second order of the barrier transmissivity, which contains the\nsecond harmonic of the phase jump, is calculated and it is found that the true\nexpansion parameter of the perturbation theory for a diffusive junction is not\nthe tunneling probability $\\Gamma$ itself, but a much larger parameter $W =\n(3\\xi_0/4l)\\Gamma$.",

    "summary": "We have used a combination of high resolution cosmological N-body simulations\nand semi-analytic modelling of galaxy formation to investigate the processes\nthat determine the spatial distribution of galaxies in cold dark matter (CDM)\nmodels. The galaxy distribution depends sensitively on the efficiency with\nwhich galaxies form in halos of different mass. In small mass halos, galaxy\nformation is inhibited by the reheating of cooled gas by feedback processes,\nwhereas in large mass halos, it is inhibited by the long cooling time of the\ngas. As a result, the mass-to-light ratio of halos has a deep minimum at the\nhalo mass associated with L* galaxies. This leads to a scale dependent bias in\nthe distribution of galaxies relative to the distribution of mass. On large\nscales, the bias in the galaxy distribution is related in a simple way to the\nbias in the distribution of massive halos. On small scales, the correlation\nfunction is determined by the interplay between various effects including the\nspatial exclusion of dark matter halos, the distribution function of the number\nof galaxies occupying a single dark matter halo and, to a lesser extent,\ndynamical friction. Remarkably, these processes conspire to produce a\ncorrelation function in a flat, Omega_0=0.3, CDM model that is close to a\npower-law over nearly four orders of magnitude in amplitude. This model agrees\nwell with the correlation function of galaxies measured in the APM survey. On\nsmall scales, the model galaxies are less strongly clustered than the dark\nmatter whereas on large scales, they trace the occupied halos. Our clustering\npredictions are robust to changes in the parameters of the galaxy formation\nmodel, provided only those models that match the bright end of the galaxy\nluminosity function are considered.

This discrepancy has generally been explained by subtle surface\nbrightness effects acting on the observational samples. In this paper, we\nexplicitly implement the computation of surface brightness in a simple\nsemi-analytic model (with standard CDM), and we estimate the effect of\nobservational surface brightness thresholds on the predicted luminosity\nfunctions. The crucial free parameter in this computation is the efficiency\nepsilon of supernova feedback which is responsible for the triggering of\ngalactic winds. With the classical formalism for this process, it is difficult\nto reproduce simultaneously the Tully-Fisher relation and the flat slope of the\nobservational luminosity function with the same value of epsilon. This suggests\nthat the triggering of galactic winds is a complex phenomenon. [...] The\nconclusion of this heuristic paper is that a more realistic description of SN\nfeedback is needed, and that surface brightness effects should not be neglected\nin the modelling of galaxy formation.",

The entire survey procedure, from the raw Schmidt\nplate data to final white dwarf luminosity function (WDLF) is described, with\nspecial emphasis on completeness concerns. We obtain a sample of 58 WDs, for\nwhich we have follow up CCD photometry and spectroscopy of a representative\nsub--sample. Effective temperatures and luminosities of our sample objects are\ndetermined by comparing photometry with the model atmosphere predictions of\nBergeron, Saumon and Wesemael. Space densities are calculated using an\nadaptation of Schmidts (1/Vmax) method, from which a WDLF is constructed.\nComparison of our observational LF with the models of both Wood and\nGarcia-Berro et al. indicate an age for the local Galactic Disc of\n10{-1}_{+3}Gyr. Importantly, we find no evidence of incompleteness in our\nsurvey sample. Proper motion number counts imply the survey is complete, and\nthe WD sample passes the (V/V_{max}) completeness test.",

    "summary": "Discontinuous initial wave functions or wave functions with discontintuous\nderivative and with bounded support arise in a natural way in various\nsituations in physics, in particular in measurement theory. The propagation of\nsuch initial wave functions is not well described by the Schr\\\"odinger current\nwhich vanishes on the boundary of the support of the wave function. This\npropagation gives rise to a uni-directional current at the boundary of the\nsupport. We use path integrals to define current and uni-directional current\nand give a direct derivation of the expression for current from the path\nintegral formulation for both diffusion and quantum mechanics. Furthermore, we\ngive an explicit asymptotic expression for the short time propagation of\ninitial wave function with compact support for both the cases of discontinuous\nderivative and discontinuous wave function. We show that in the former case the\nprobability propagated across the boundary of the support in time $\\Delta t$ is\n$O(\\Delta t^{3/2})$ and the initial uni-directional current is $O(\\Delta\nt^{1/2})$. This recovers the Zeno effect for continuous detection of a particle\nin a given domain. For the latter case the probability propagated across the\nboundary of the support in time $\\Delta t$ is $O(\\Delta t^{1/2})$ and the\ninitial uni-directional current is $O(\\Delta t^{-1/2})$. This is an anti-Zeno\neffect. However, the probability propagated across a point located at a finite\ndistance from the boundary of the support is $O(\\Delta t)$. This gives a decay\nlaw.",

We review the X-ray and optical\nsurveys of the fossil star formation regions in the Orion OB1 association. Low\nmass pre-main sequence stars abound not only in the known regions of recent\nstar formation, but are also distributed over a much larger volume. The\npre-main sequence stars have a narrow age spread, and the mass function extends\ndown to substellar masses. The clustering of pre-main sequence stars around\nsigma Ori may represent an evolved version of the Orion Nebula Cluster. We\nspeculate about the effect of the OB environment on the initial mass function\nand the formation of planetary systems like the Solar System.",

    "summary": "Motivated by the recent experimental announcements for direct measurements of\ntime-reversal non-invariance in the neutral kaon system, we make a comparative\ndiscussion of the CPLEAR and KTeV measurements. The most suitable way to\nconsistently incorporate the mixing, the time evolution and the decays of\nkaons, is to describe the neutral kaon system as a system with a non-Hermitean\nHamiltonian. In this framework, the physical (decaying) incoming and outgoing\nstates are distinct and belong to dual spaces. Moreover, since they are\neigenstates of the full Hamiltonian, they never oscillate. This is directly\nmanifest in the orthogonality conditions of the physical states, which entirely\ndetermine the evolution of the kaon system. Along these lines we conclude:\nCPLEAR studies K0-bar{K0} oscillations, a process where initial and final\nstates can be reversed, the CPLEAR asymmetry being an effect directly related\nto the definition of time-reversal. Conclusively, CPLEAR provides a direct\nmeasurement of T-violation without any assumption either on unitarity or on\nCPT-invariance. The KTeV experiment studies in particular the process KL -> pi+\npi- e+ e- where they measure a T-odd effect. However, using unitarity together\nwith estimates of the final state interactions, it should be possible to\ndetermine whether this effect can be identified with a genuine T-reversal\nviolation.",

If all these parameters are under searching then observable data\non the Abell-ACO power spectrum and mass function prefer models which have\nparameters in the range $\\Omega_{\\nu}$ ($\\sim 0.4-0.5$), low $\\Omega_b$ ($\\le\n0.01$) and $h$ ($\\sim 0.4-0.6$).

We identified the optical counterpart, measured\nthe 5.9573 hr orbital period and constrained the binary inclination and the\nsource distance. The distance lower limit indicates that the source is at least\n2.6 kpc from the Galactic plane, which is unusual for an LMXB. RXTE\nobservations were made between June and August 1998 during the first detected\noutburst from this source. We describe correlations between X-ray timing and\nspectral properties and discuss the possibility that the propeller mechanism\nturned on during the decay of the outburst. During one of the RXTE\nobservations, we detect a pair of high frequency QPOs at 847.1 +/- 5.5 Hz and\n1102 +/- 13 Hz simultaneously. According to the beat frequency model, the QPO\nseparation implies a neutron star spin period near 3.9 ms. As the X-ray flux\ndecreases at the end of the outburst, the amplitude of the optical modulation\nincreases significantly. This behavior can be explained if the size of the\naccretion disk decreases during the decay of the outburst.",

The decay rate of\n$B\\to\\phi K^*$ is very sensitive to the form-factor ratio A_2/A_1; the absence\nof $B\\to\\phi K$ events does not necessarily invalidate the factorization\napproach. If the branching ratio of $B^-\\to\\omega K^-$ is experimentally found\nto be significantly larger than that of $B^-\\to\\rho^0 K^-$, we argue that\ninelastic final-state rescattering may account for the disparity between\n$\\omega K^-$ and $\\rho^0 K^-$.",

This regeneration can lead to a day-night effect\nand an energy dependence of the suppression of solar electron neutrinos, even\nfor the case of maximal mixing.

The models include a mass\nspectrum, mass loss due to stellar evolution, and the tidal field of the parent\ngalaxy. Recent N-body calculations have revealed a serious discrepancy between\nthe results of N-body calculations and isotropic FP calculations. The main\nreason for the discrepancy is an oversimplified treatment of the tidal field\nemployed in the isotropic FP models. In this paper we perform a series of\ncalculations with anisotropic FP models with a better treatment of the tidal\nboundary and compare these with N-body calculations. The new tidal boundary\ncondition in our FP model includes one free parameter. We find that a single\nvalue of this parameter gives satisfactory agreement between the N-body and FP\nmodels over a wide range of initial conditions.\n  Using the improved FP model, we carry out an extensive survey of the\nevolution of globular clusters over a wide range of initial conditions varying\nthe slope of the mass function, the central concentration, and the relaxation\ntime. The evolution of clusters is followed up to the moment of core collapse\nor the disruption of the clusters in the tidal field of the parent galaxy. In\ngeneral, our model clusters, calculated with the anisotropic FP model with the\nimproved treatment for the tidal boundary, live longer than isotropic models.\nThe difference in the lifetime between the isotropic and anisotropic models is\nparticularly large when the effect of mass loss via stellar evolution is rather\nsignificant. On the other hand the difference is small for relaxation-\ndominated clusters which initially have steep mass functions and high central\nconcentrations.",

We find\nthat it is possible to probe neutrino oscillations through colliders in most of\nthe R-parity conserving MSSM parameter space.",

It is well-known that a choice\nof gauge in generally covariant models has a twofold pupose: not only to render\nthe dynamics unique, but also to define the spacetime points. A geometric way\nof choosing gauge that is not based on coordinate conditions---the so-called\ncovariant gauge fixing---is described. After a covariant gauge fixing, the\ndynamics is unique and the background manifold points are well-defined, but the\ndescription remains invariant with respect to all diffeomorphisms of the\nbackground manifold. Transformations between different covariant gauge fixings\nform the well-known Bergmann-Komar group. Each covariant gauge fixing\ndetermines a so-called Kucha\\v{r} decomposition. The construction of the\nquantum theory is based on the Kucha\\v{r} form of the action and the Dirac\nmethod of operator constraints. It is demonstrated that the Bergmann-Komar\ngroup is too large to be implementable by unitary maps in the quantum domain.",

Because of that, we write down the right mean-field\ngap equation and solve it by using a normal state one-particle Green function\nwhich gives a Mott metal-insulator transition for $T > T_c$ and which is valid\nfor any value of U. In consequence, we are not allowed to use mean-field theory\nfor both U and pairing (V).

We show that when the gap between the coaxial cylinders is wide\nenough, the criterion for the onset of the finite amplitude instability can be\nexpressed in terms of a gradient Reynolds number. Based on Wendt's results, we\nargue that turbulence may be sustained by differential rotation when the\nangular velocity decreases outward, as in keplerian flows. From the rotation\nprofiles and the torque measurements we deduce a prescription for the turbulent\nviscosity which is independent of gap width; with some caution it may be\napplied to stellar interiors and to accretion disks.",

The X-ray spectrum\nfor each period is well fitted with a single power-law absorbed by a high\ncolumn of gas. The X-ray flux changes by a factor of 2 from period to period,\nbut the other spectral parameters show no significant change. The photon index\nis flat with \\Gamma = 0.9--1.3. The column densities of hydrogen N_H is $\\sim$\n1.0 x 10^{23} H cm^{-2} and that of iron N_{Fe} is $\\sim$ 10^{19} Fe cm^{-2}.\nThese large column densities indicate that 1E 1740.7-2942 is near at the\nGalactic Center. The column density ratio leads the iron abundance to be 2\ntimes larger than the other elements in a unit of the solar ratio. The\nequivalent width of the K\\alpha-line from a neutral iron is less than 15 eV in\n90% confidence. This indicates that the iron column density within several\nparsecs from 1E 1740.7-2942 is less than 5 x 10^{17} Fe cm^{-2}. In addition,\nthe derived hydrogen column density is about 1/6 of that of giant molecular\nclouds in the line of sight. All these facts support that 1E 1740.7-2942 is not\nin a molecular cloud, but possibly in front of it; the X-rays are not powered\nby accretion from a molecular cloud, but from a companion star like ordinary\nX-ray binaries.",

The\nobserved flux depends on the combinations (gamma Delta theta) and (gamma\ntheta_v), where (Delta theta) is the beaming angle and theta_v is the viewing\nangle. We use the observed source counts of gamma-ray-selected GRBs to predict\nthe minimum detection rate of prompt x-ray bursts as a function of limiting\nsensitivity. We compare our predictions with the results from the Ariel V\ncatalog of fast x-ray transients, and find that Ariel's sensitivity is not\ngreat enough to place significant constraints on gamma and (Delta theta). We\nestimate that a detector with fluence limit ~10^{-7} erg/cm^2 in the 2-10 keV\nchannel will be necessary to distinguish between geometries.

These higher\nloop contributions are characteristic for non-Abelian gauge theories and their\ncalculation is simplified by using the hard thermal loop effective theory.\nRemarkably, the effective one-loop polarization tensor is found to be gauge\nfixing independent and transverse at leading order in $g$.

Deep optical and near-IR\nimaging have revealed a galaxy overdensity around the peak of the X-ray\nemission, with a significant excess of red objects with J-K colors typical of\nelliptical galaxies at z>1. Spectroscopic observations at the Keck II telescope\nhave secured 6 galaxy redshifts in the range 1.257<z<1.267 (<z>=1.261), within\na 35 arcsec radius around the peak X-ray emission. This system lies only 4.2\narcmin away (5.0 h^{-1}_{50} comoving Mpc, q_0=0.5) from the galaxy cluster ClG\nJ0848+4453, which was identified by Stanford et al. (1997) at z=1.273 in a\nnear-IR field galaxy survey, and is also known to be X-ray luminous. Assuming\nthat the X-ray emission is entirely due to hot intra-cluster gas, both these\nsystems have similar rest frame luminosities L_x ~=1x10^{44} ergs/s (0.5-2.0\nkeV band). In combination with our spectrophotometric data for the entire 30\narcmin^2 field, this suggests the presence of a superstructure, consisting of\ntwo collapsed, possibly virialized clusters, the first detected to date at z>1.",

    "summary": "The search for intersecting brane solutions in supergravity is a large and\nprofitable industry. Recently, attention has focused on finding localized forms\nof known `delocalized' solutions. However, in some cases, a localized version\nof the delocalized solution simply does not exist. Instead, localized separated\nbranes necessarily delocalize as the separation is removed. This phenomenon is\nrelated to black hole no-hair theorems, i.e. `baldness.' We continue the\ndiscussion of this effect and describe how it can be understood, in the case of\nDirichlet branes, in terms of the corresponding intersection field theory. When\nit occurs, it is associated with the quantum mixing of phases and lack of\nsuperselection sectors in low dimensional field theories. We find surprisingly\nwide agreement between the field theory and supergravity both with respect to\nwhich examples delocalize and with respect to the rate at which this occurs.",

It\nnow seems clear that molecular clouds in the Galaxy at least form from\ncompressed HI entering a spiral arm. The internal clumpy structure within\nclouds probably results from the magnification of inhomogeneities in the\nprecursor HI. This structure is self-similar in nature independent of the star\nforming nature of the cloud. However, at high densities and small scales, there\nare departures from self-similarity that may be related to the mass scale of\nstars. If confirmed, it may be that the mass of a star is related more to the\nmass of the core from which it forms than by the details of the formation\nprocess itself.",

It has been suggested that the string scale could be as low as a\nTeV. The greatest obstacle to developing a string phenomenology is our lack of\nunderstanding of the ground state. We explain why the dynamics which determines\nthis state is not likely to be accessible to any systematic approximation. We\nnote that the racetrack scheme, often cited as a counterexample, suffers from\nsimilar difficulties. We stress that the weakness of the gauge couplings, the\ngauge hierarchy, and coupling unification suggest that it may be possible to\nextract some information in a systematic approximation. We review the ideas of\nKahler stabilization, an attempt to reconcile these facts. We consider whether\nthe system is likely to sit at extremes of the moduli space, as in recent\nproposals for a low string scale. Finally we discuss the idea of Maximally\nEnhanced Symmetry, a hypothesis which is technically natural, compatible with\nbasic facts about cosmology, and potentially predictive.",

For a class of systems possessing\nstochastic stability, we show that this new order parameter function is\nintimately related to the static order parameter function, describing the\ndistribution of overlaps between clustering states. The same method is applied\nto investigate the geometrical organization of pure states. We show that the\nultrametric organization in the dynamics implies static ultrametricity, and we\nrelate these properties to static separability, i.e., the property that the\nmeasure of the overlap between pure states is essentially unique.

    "summary": "The spectrum of higher harmonics in atoms calculated with a uniformized\nsemiclassical propagator is presented and it is shown that higher harmonic\ngeneration is an interference phenomenon which can be described\nsemiclassically. This can be concluded from the good agreement with the quantum\nspectrum. Moreover, the formation of a plateau in the spectrum is specifically\ndue to the interference of irregular, time delayed, trajectories with regular\norbits without a time-delay. This is proven by the absence of the plateau in an\nartificial semiclassical spectrum generated from a sample of trajectories from\nwhich the irregular trajectories (only a few percent) have been discarded.",

Assuming that the high-order correlation functions of the matter\nfield behave as products of two-body correlation functions, we derive the\ncorrelation properties of the halos, that are assumed to represent the\ncorrelation properties of galaxies or clusters.\n  The hierarchical pattern originally induced by gravity is shown to be\nconserved for the halos. The strength of their correlations at any order\nvaries, however, but is found to depend only on their internal properties,\nnamely on the parameter x=m/r^(3-gamma) where m is the mass of the halo, r its\nsize and gammma is the power law index of the two-body correlation function. We\nwere able to derive the explicit form of the generating function of the moments\nof the halo count probability distribution function. In particular we show\nexplicitely that, generically, S_p(x) -> p^(p-2) in the rare halo limit.\n  Various illustrations of our general results are presented. As a function of\nthe properties of the underlying matter field, we construct the count\nprobabilities for halos and in particular discuss the halo void probability. We\nalso evaluate the dependence of the halo mass function on the environment. We\nfound that within clusters, hierarchical clustering implies the higher masses\nare favored.

    "summary": "The results of VLBI observations of the quasar 3C273, obtained during a\nmulti-frequency campaign in late 1992 in the radio, millimeter and X-ray bands\nare presented and discussed. The VLBI observations were made at 22 GHz with a\nGlobal Array and at 43 GHz with the Very Long Baseline Array. Hybrid maps and\nmodelfits were made in order to look for any short time scale structural\nvariations of the inner part of the radio jet. In 42 days 3C273 was observed 5\ntimes at roughly 10 day intervals. The jet structure did not show dramatic\nchanges in that period. However, we were able to follow the changes in the\npositions of the components along the first 2 mas of the jet with respect to\nthe core. The resolution achieved by these observations allows the\ndecomposition of the apparent velocity vector of each component into two\northogonal directions. We find evidence of reverse motion for a component along\nthe jet. The jet starts wiggling well inside the first parsec from the core.\nThe spatial period of the quasi-sinusoidal oscillating jet path about the jet\nmajor axis was derived for distances between 2 and 8 mas from the core.",

Up/down asymmetry obtained using\ncontained events recorded by detectors at Kamioka site probes low energy region\nof atmospheric neutrino whereas, the suggested method probes high energy\nneutrinos. It mainly depends on the observations and it is free of\nuncertainties in neutrino flux, interaction cross section etc. In this paper we\ndemonstrate that the method is sensitive to a region of oscillation parameter\nspace that explains all the features of atmospheric neutrino data in the\nSuper-Kamiokande detector; the limiting factor being the statistical strength\nof the KGF observations. This method provides the only way to study the up/down\nasymmetry beyond Multi-GeV region which is yet to be measured experimentally.",

Using a very efficient numerical scattering\ntechnique, we are able to perform simulations, over large length scales, and to\ninvestigate spin-transport in the ballistic, diffusive and localized regimes,\nas well as the crossover between them. The competition between disorder-induced\nmean free path reduction and disorder-induced spin asymmetry enhancement of the\nconductance highlights several different regimes of GMR.",

To do so they have developed sophisticated cooperative behavior and\nintricate communication capabilities, such as: direct cell-cell physical\ninteractions via extra-membrane polymers, collective production of\nextracellular \"wetting\" fluid for movement on hard surfaces, long range\nchemical signaling such as quorum sensing and chemotactic (bias of movement\naccording to gradient of chemical agent) signaling, collective activation and\ndeactivation of genes and even exchange of genetic material. Utilizing these\ncapabilities, the colonies develop complex spatio-temporal patterns in response\nto adverse growth conditions. We present a wealth of branching and chiral\npatterns formed during colonial development of lubricating bacteria (bacteria\nwhich produce a wetting layer of fluid for their movement). Invoking ideas from\npattern formation in non-living systems and using ``generic'' modeling we are\nable to reveal novel survival strategies which account for the salient features\nof the evolved patterns. Using the models, we demonstrate how communication\nleads to self-organization via cooperative behavior of the cells. In this\nregard, pattern formation in microorganisms can be viewed as the result of the\nexchange of information between the micro-level (the individual cells) and the\nmacro-level (the colony). We mainly review known results, but include a new\nmodel of chiral growth, which enables us to study the effect of chemotactic\nsignaling on the chiral growth. We also introduce a measure for weak chirality\nand use this measure to compare the results of model simulations with\nexperimental observations.",

The Camassa-Holm equations, given their special\ngeometric and physical properties, appear particularly well suited for studying\nturbulent flows. We identify the steady solution of the Camassa-Holm equation\nwith the mean flow of the Reynolds equation and compare the results with\nempirical data for turbulent flows in channels and pipes. The data suggests\nthat the constant $\\alpha$ version of the Camassa-Holm equations, derived under\nthe assumptions that the fluctuation statistics are isotropic and homogeneous,\nholds to order $\\alpha$ distance from the boundaries. Near a boundary, these\nassumptions are no longer valid and the length scale $\\alpha$ is seen to depend\non the distance to the nearest wall. Thus, a turbulent flow is divided into two\nregions: the constant $\\alpha$ region away from boundaries, and the near wall\nregion. In the near wall region, Reynolds number scaling conditions imply that\n$\\alpha$ decreases as Reynolds number increases. Away from boundaries, these\nscaling conditions imply $\\alpha$ is independent of Reynolds number. Given the\nagreement with empirical and numerical data, our current work indicates that\nthe Camassa-Holm equations provide a promising theoretical framework from which\nto understand some turbulent flows.",

Quite remarkably it turned out that the\nshapes of the daily gamma-ray energy spectra remained essentially stable\nthroughout the entire state of high activity despite dramatic flux variations\nduring this period. The derivation of a long term time-averaged energy\nspectrum, based on more than 38,000 detected TeV photons, is therefore\nphysically meaningful. The unprecedented gamma-ray statistics combined with the\n20% energy resolution of the instrument resulted in the first detection of\ngamma-rays from an extragalactic source well beyond 10 TeV, and the first high\naccuracy measurement of an exponential cutoff in the energy region above 5 TeV\ndeeply into the exponential regime. From 500 GeV to 24 TeV the differential\nphoton spectrum is well approximated by a power-law with an exponential cutoff:\ndN/dE = N0 (E/1 TeV)^{-alpha} exp(-E/E0), with N0=(10.8 +-0.2(stat) +-2.1(sys))\n1E-11/cm^2 s TeV, alpha=1.92 +-0.03(stat) +-0.20(sys), and E0=(6.2 +-0.4(stat)\n(-1.5 +2.9)(sys) TeV. We summarize the methods for the evaluation of the energy\nspectrum in a broad dynamical range which covers almost two energy decades, and\nstudy in detail the principal sources of systematic errors.

    "summary": "ElectroMagnetic Quantum Gravity (EMQG) is applied to the problem of the\nCosmological Constant. EMQG is a quantum gravity theory (ref. 1) in which the\nvirtual particles of the quantum vacuum play a very important role in all\ngravitational interactions, and also in accelerated motion. According to EMQG\ntheory (and quantum field theory in general), empty space is populated by vast\nnumbers of virtual particles, consisting of virtual fermion and virtual\nanti-fermion particles, which posses mass, and also virtual boson particles of\nall the various force particle species. Therefore the problem of the\ncosmological constant is essentially equivalent to a determination of the mass\ncontributed by all the virtual particles of the vacuum to the overall curvature\nand dynamics of the entire universe. Our original analysis was based on the\nassumption of perfect symmetry in the creation and destruction of virtual\nfermion and virtual anti-fermion particle pairs in the quantum vacuum, which is\nin accordance with the existing laws of conservation of both electric charge,\nand also of the new law of conservation of gravitational 'mass charge'. We now\nbelieve that this may not be necessarily true, and that EMQG can allow the\npossibility of a very tiny value for the cosmological constant. Furthermore, it\nturns out that this question can only be resolved when a solution to the\nproblem of baryon asymmetry in the universe is resolved. In other words an\nanswer must be found as to why our universe seems to contain only real matter,\nand very little, if any anti-matter.",

However, even the systematic study by Seyfert (1943) was\nnot enough to launch active galactic nuclei (AGN) as a major topic of\nastronomy. The advances in radio astronomy in the 1950s revealed a new universe\nof energetic phenomena, and inevitably led to the discovery of quasars. These\ndiscoveries demanded the attention of observers and theorists, and AGN have\nbeen a subject of intense effort ever since. Only a year after the recognition\nof the redshifts of 3C 273 and 3C 48 in 1963, the idea of energy production by\naccretion onto a black hole was advanced. However, acceptance of this idea came\nslowly, encouraged by the discovery of black hole X-ray sources in our Galaxy\nand, more recently, supermassive black holes in the center of the Milky Way and\nother galaxies. Many questions remain as to the formation and fueling of the\nhole, the geometry of the central regions, the detailed emission mechanisms,\nthe production of jets, and other aspects. The study of AGN will remain a\nvigorous part of astronomy for the foreseeable future.",

    "summary": "The energy requirements of gamma ray bursts have in past been poorly\nconstrained because of three major uncertainties: The distances to bursts, the\ndegree of burst beaming, and the efficiency of gamma ray production. The first\nof these has been resolved, with both indirect evidence (the distribution of\nbursts in flux and position) and direct evidence (redshifted absorption\nfeatures in the afterglow spectrum of GRB 970508) pointing to cosmological\ndistances. We now wish to address the second uncertainty. Afterglows allow a\nstatistical test of beaming, described in an earlier paper. In this paper, we\nmodify a standard fireball afterglow model to explore the effects of beaming on\nburst remnant dynamics and afterglow emission. If the burst ejecta are beamed\ninto angle zeta, the burst remnant's evolution changes qualitatively once its\nbulk Lorentz factor Gamma < 1/zeta: Before this, Gamma declines as a power law\nof radius, while afterwards, it declines exponentially. This change results in\na broken power law light curve whose late-time decay is faster than expected\nfor a purely spherical geometry. These predictions disagree with afterglow\nobservations of GRB 970508. We explored several variations on our model, but\nnone seems able to change this result. We therefore suggest that this burst is\nunlikely to have been highly beamed, and that its energy requirements were near\nthose of isotropic models. More recent afterglows may offer the first practical\napplications for our beamed models.",

If a uniform field in a\nperiodic box serves as the initial condition for modeling the backreaction on\nthe turbulent EMF, then the magnitude of the turbulent EMF and thus the dynamo\ncoefficient $\\a$, have a stringent upper limit that depends on the magnetic\nReynolds number $R_M$ to a power of order -1. This is not a dynamic suppression\nbut results just because of the imposed boundary conditions. In contrast, when\nmean field gradients are allowed within the simulation region, or non-periodic\nboundary are used, the upper limit is independent of $R_M$ and takes its\nkinematic value. Thus only for simulations of the latter types could a measured\nsuppression be the result of a dynamic backreaction. This is fundamental for\nunderstanding a long-standing controversy surrounding $\\alpha$ suppression.\nNumerical simulations which do not allow any field gradients and invoke\nperiodic boundary conditions appear to show a strong $\\alpha$ suppression (e.g.\nCattaneo & Hughes 1996).

The sum rule which relates the overall strength\nof the interaction to the energy density of QCD vacuum is derived.\nSurprisingly, we find that when the size of the dipoles shrinks to zero (the\nheavy quark limit in the case of quarkonia), the non-perturbative part of the\ninteraction vanishes more slowly than the perturbative part as a consequence of\nscale anomaly. As an application, we evaluate elastic \\pi J/\\psi and \\pi J/\\psi\n\\to \\pi \\psi' cross sections.",

One may instead adopt an agnostic attitude towards such issues, and\nseek only to understand in what circumstances one player has a winning strategy\nagainst the combined forces of the other two. By limiting ourselves to this\nmore modest theoretical objective, and by regarding two games as being\nequivalent if they are interchangeable in all disjunctive sums,as far as\nsingle-player winnability is concerned, we can obtain an interesting analogue\nof Grundy values for three-player impartial games.",

In\nparticular, we examine the behavior in games in which the dimension of the\nstrategy space, m, is the same for all agents and fixed for all time. We find\nthat for all values of m, not too large, evolution results in a substantial\nimprovement in overall system performance. We also show that after evolution,\nresults obey a scaling relation among games played with different values of m\nand different numbers of agents, analogous to that found in the\nnon-evolutionary, adaptive games. Best system performance still occurs, for a\ngiven number of agents, at m_c, the same value of the dimension of the strategy\nspace as in the non-evolutionary case, but system performance is now nearly an\norder of magnitude better than the non- evolutionary result. For m<m_c, the\nsystem evolves to states in which average agent wealth is better than in the\nrandom choice game,despite (and in some sense because of) the persistence of\nmaladaptive behavior by some agents. As m gets large, overall systems\nperformance approaches that of the random choice game.",

However, unlike the previous\ncases, which appear to show stationary frequencies, the QPO frequency in XTE\nJ1550-564 must vary by at least 10% to be consistent with observations. The\noccurrences and properties of the QPO were insensitive to large changes in the\nX-ray intensity (1.5 to 6.8 Crab). However, the QPO appearance was accompanied\nby changes in the energy spectrum, namely, an increase in the temperature and a\ndecrease in the normalization of the thermal component. The QPO is also closely\nrelated to the hard X-ray power-law component of the energy spectrum since the\nfractional amplitude of the QPO increases with photon energy. The fast QPOs in\naccreting black hole binaries are thought to be effects of general relativity;\nhowever, the relevance of the specific physical models that have been proposed\nremains largely uncertain. Low frequency QPOs in the range 3-13 Hz were often\nobserved. Occasionally at high luminosity the rms QPO amplitude was 15% of the\nflux, a level previously reached only by GRS1915+105.",

As a first\nstep, we resum logarithms in the Coulombic part of the t-tbar potential and\nobserve a considerable improvement in the convergence of corresponding\ncorrections.

Exact\nresults are obtained using a correspondence between the surface magnetization\nof the model and the surviving probability of a random walk with time-dependent\nabsorbing boundary conditions. For slow enough decay, $\\kappa<1/2$, the\ninhomogeneity is relevant: Either the surface stays ordered at the bulk\ncritical point or the average surface magnetization displays an essential\nsingularity, depending on the sign of $A$. In the marginal situation,\n$\\kappa=1/2$, the average surface magnetization decays as a power law with a\ncontinuously varying, $A$-dependent, critical exponent which is obtained\nanalytically. The behavior of the critical and off-critical autocorrelation\nfunctions as well as the scaling form of the probability distributions for the\nsurface magnetization and the first gaps are determined through a\nphenomenological scaling theory. In the Griffiths phase, the properties of the\nGriffiths-McCoy singularities are not affected by the inhomogeneity. The\nvarious results are checked using numerical methods based on a mapping to free\nfermions.",

Values of\nthe constraints and of the parameters entering into the constraints, which\nrestrict the range of the \\bar{\\rho} and \\bar{\\eta} parameters, include recent\nmeasurements presented at 1998 Summer Conferences and progress obtained by\nlattice QCD collaborations. The results are: \\bar{\\rho}=0.202\n^{+0.053}_{-0.059},\\bar{\\eta}=0.340 \\pm 0.035, from which the angles \\alpha,\n\\beta and \\gamma of the unitarity triangle are inferred : \\sin 2 \\alpha = -0.26\n^{+ 0.29}_{-0.28} ,\\sin 2 \\beta = 0.725 ^{+0.050}_{-0.060} ,\\gamma=\n(59.5^{+8.5}_{-7.5})^{\\circ}. Without using the constraint from \\epsilon_K,\n\\sin 2 \\beta has been obtained: \\sin 2 \\beta = 0.72 ^{+0.07}_{-0.11}. Several\nexternal measurements or theoretical inputs have been removed, in turn, from\nthe constraints and their respective probability density functions have been\nobtained. Central values and uncertainties on these quantities have been\ncompared with actual measurements or theoretical evaluations. In this way it is\npossible to quantify the importance of the different measurements and the\ncoherence of the Standard Model scenario for CP violation. An important result\nis that \\Delta m_s is expected to be between [12.0-17.6] ps^{-1} with 68% C.L.\nand <20 ps^{-1} at 95% C.L.

This fact suggests that the differences between the properties of\npresent-day spirals and those of high-z DLA systems may not be ascribed to\nevolution. Several selection effects can bias the observed population of DLA\nabsorbers. Analysis of these effects indicates that the fraction of spiral\ngalaxies tends to be underestimated relative to the fraction of low-mass or LSB\ngalaxies.",

UGC2855 is shown to belong to the\nrare class of galaxies with a long (~ 8kpc) continuous molecular bar. The\nvelocity field along the bar is dominated by solid-body rotation and shows few\nperturbations. This, together with an almost constant and low ^12CO/^13CO line\nintensity ratio along the bar and in the center as well as only weak H alpha\nemission, indicate that the gas in the bar is not subjected to strong shocks,\nbut surprisingly quiescent. In the central 3'', a high velocity feature\nconsisting of a number of Giant Molecular Associations, is identified. We\ndiscuss possible scenarios of the nature of this structure in connection with\nthe question of the presence of an Inner Lindblad Resonance (ILR) in the bar.\nWe suggest that the bar of UGC2855 is a young object, possibly has no ILR, and\nthat the mass concentration toward the center of the galaxy is just beginning.\nIn contrast, the companion UGC2866 experiences a strong starburst. We compare\nthe properties of the gas in the bar of UGC2855 to those we find in NGC7479.\nDespite superficial parallels, the two bars are very dissimilar objects in\nterms of ^12CO/^13CO line ratio, velocity field and H alpha activity.

Our spectroscopic dataset comprises Keck I-HIRES, WHT-ISIS and\nUKIRT-CGS4 observations which show that NaSt1 has a highly reddened nebular\nspectrum with extremely strong permitted and forbidden lines covering a wide\nrange in excitation. [OII-III] is unusually weak, with HeI-II and [NII] very\nstrong, and carbon absent, suggestive of chemical peculiarities. Narrow-band\nWHT imaging reveals an elliptical nebula with an average diameter of 6.8arcsec.\nWe measure an interstellar extinction of E(B-V)=2.1mag and estimate a distance\nof 1-3kpc, suggesting that NaSt1 is a luminous object, with 4<log(L/Lo)<6.5. We\ndetermine the physical parameters and abundances from the nebular forbidden\nlines. For Te=13,000K and Ne=3x10^6 cm^3, we obtain He/H>0.64, N enhanced by a\nfactor of 20, O deficient by a factor of 140, while Ne, Ar and S are normal\ncompared to average HII region abundances. This unusual abundance pattern\nsuggests that the nebula consists of fully CNO-processed material. We compare\nthe spectral appearance of NaSt1 with other luminous emission objects, and\nconclude that it is not an Ofpe/WN9, B[e] star or symbiotic nova although it\ndoes share several characteristics of these systems. We suggest instead that\nNaSt1 contains a massive evolved star that ejected its heavily CNO-processed\nouter layers a few thousand years ago. Although the stellar remnant is\ncompletely hidden from view by the dense nebula, we argue that the star must be\nan early-type WR star.

    "summary": "We study a family of correlated one-dimensional random walks with a finite\nmemory range M.These walks are extensions of the Taylor's walk as investigated\nby Goldstein, which has a memory range equal to one. At each step, with a\nprobability p, the random walker moves either to the right or to the left with\nequal probabilities, or with a probability q=1-p performs a move, which is a\nstochastic Boolean function of the M previous steps. We first derive the most\ngeneral form of this stochastic Boolean function, and study some typical cases\nwhich ensure that the average value <R_n> of the walker's location after n\nsteps is zero for all values of n. In each case, using a matrix technique, we\nprovide a general method for constructing the generating function of the\nprobability distribution of R_n; we also establish directly an exact analytic\nexpression for the step-step correlations and the variance <R_n^2> of the walk.\n  From the expression of <R_n^2>, which is not straightforward to derive from\nthe probability distribution, we show that, for n going to infinity, the\nvariance of any of these walks behaves as n, provided p>0. Moreover, in many\ncases, for a very small fixed value of p, the variance exhibits a crossover\nphenomenon as $n$ increases from a not too large value. The crossover takes\nplace for values of $n$ around 1/p. This feature may mimic the existence of a\nnon-trivial Hurst exponent, and induce a misleading analysis of numerical data\nissued from mathematical or natural sciences experiments.",

    "summary": "The aim of this paper is to present a generalization of Lunn-Senior's\nmathematical model of isomerism in organic chemistry. The main idea of Lunn and\nSenior is that if the type of isomerism is fixed, a molecule with a fixed\nskeleton and d univalent substituents has a symmetry group $W\\leq S_d$ which is\ngenerally not the molecule's 3-dimensional symmetry group. The unit character\nof W induces a representation of the symmetric group $S_d$ which governs the\ncombinatorics of the isomers of the given molecule. Lunn-Senior's thesis is\nthat certain non-negative integers established by this representation are upper\nboundaries of the corresponding numbers, yielded by the experiment (and often\ncoincide with them). Moreover, the authors define (in a particular case) a\npartial order among the objects of the model, such that some simple\nsubstitution reactions correspond to inequalities. These two groups of data\ndetermine the group W, and produce so called \"type properties\" of the molecule\n(properties which do not depend on the nature of the univalent substituents).\nOur hypothesis is that if we replace the unit character of $W$ by any\none-dimensional character of $W$ (thus we count only a part of the isomers -\nthose having a maximum property), we also get a type property of the molecule.\nAn instance of that is the inventory of the stereoisomers called chiral pairs.\nThe formalism can be generalized naturally and produces some preliminary\nchemical results. Especially the partial order is defined and studied in the\ngeneral case and indicates the possible genetic relations among the\ncorresponding molecules. An important result of E. Ruch which connects the\ndominance order among partitions and the existence of chiral pairs is obtained\nas a consequence of a more general statement.",

In this regime, pressure and gravity exchange roles as\ndrivers and inhibitors of spiral wave structures.

We consider two cosmologies: a critical universe with a\nCDM power-spectrum and an open universe with $\\Omega_0=0.3$, $\\Lambda=0$. The\nderived quasar luminosity function agrees reasonably well with observations at\n$z<4.5$ and with constraints over larger redshifts from the HDF. The radiation\nproduced by these objects at $z \\sim 16$ slowly reheats the universe which gets\nsuddenly reionized at $z_{ri}=6.8$ for the open universe ($z_{ri}=5.6$ for the\ncritical density universe). The UV background radiation simultaneously\nincreases sharply to reach a maximum of $J_{21} = 0.18$ at $z=2.6$, but shows\nstrong ionization edges until $z \\leq 1$. The metallicity of the gas increases\nquickly at high $z$ and is already larger than $0.01 Z_{\\odot}$ at $z=10$. The\nQSO number counts and the helium opacity constrain the reionization redshift to\nbe $z_{ri} \\sim 6$. We confirm that a population of faint quasars is needed in\norder to satisfy the observations. Due to the low reionization redshift, the\ndamping of CMB fluctuations is quite small, but future observations (e.g. with\nthe NGST) of the multiplicity functions of radiation sources and of the HI and\nHeII opacities will strongly constrain scenarios in which reionization is due\nto QSOs.",

On account of M\\\"{o}ssbauer spectroscopy and\nhigh-field magnetisation results, we consider a particle as composed of a core\nand a surface shell of constant thickness. The magnetic state in the particle\nis described by the anisotropic classical Dirac-Heisenberg model including\nexchange and dipolar interactions and bulk and surface anisotropy. We consider\nthe case of ellipsoidal (or spherical) particles with free boundaries at the\nsurface. Using a surface shell of constant thickness ($\\sim 0.35$ nm) we vary\nthe particle size and study the effect of surface magnetic disorder on the\nthermal and spatial behaviors of the net magnetisation of the particle. We\nstudy the shift in the surface ``critical region'' for different\nsurface-to-core ratios of the exchange coupling constants. It is also shown\nthat the profile of the local magnetisation exhibits strong temperature\ndependence, and that surface anisotropy is reponsible for the non saturation of\nthe magnetisation at low temperatures.",

The unitarity of the CFT\nstrongly suggests that all information about an initial state that forms a\nblack hole is returned in the Hawking radiation. The CFT dynamics implies an\ninformation retention time of order the black hole lifetime. This fact\ndetermines many qualitative properties of the non-local effects that must show\nup in a semi-classical effective theory in the bulk. We argue that no\nviolations of causality are apparent to local observers, but the semi-classical\ntheory in the bulk duplicates degrees of freedom inside and outside the event\nhorizon. Non-local quantum effects are required to eliminate this redundancy.\nThis leads to a breakdown of the usual classical-quantum correspondence\nprinciple in Lorentzian black hole spacetimes.",

The molecular spiral arms are revealed with unprecedented clarity:\nsupermassive cloud complexes, Giant Molecular Associations, are for the first\ntime resolved both along and perpendicular to the arms. Major complexes occur\nsymmetrically opposite each other in the two major arms. Streaming motions can\nbe studied in detail along the major and minor axes of M51. The streaming\nvelocities are very large, 60-150 km/s. For the first time, sufficient\nresolution to resolve the structure in the molecular streaming motions is\nobtained. Our data support the presence of galactic shocks in the arms of M51.\nIn general, velocity gradients across arms are higher by a factor of 2-10 than\npreviously found. They vary in steepness along the spiral arms, becoming\nparticularly steep in between GMAs. The steep gradients cause conditions of\nstrong reverse shear in several regions in the arms, and thus the notion that\nshear is generally reduced by streaming motions in spiral arms will have to be\nmodified. Of the three GMAs studied on the SW arm, only one shows reduced\nshear. We find an expansion in the NE molecular arm at 25'' radius SE of the\ncenter. This broadening occurs right after the end of the NE arm at the Inner\nLindblad Resonance. Bifurcations in the molecular spiral arm structure, at a\nradius of 73'', may be evidence of a secondary compression of the gas caused by\nthe 4/1 ultraharmonic resonance. Inside the radius of the ILR, we detect narrow\n(~ 5'') molecular spiral arms possibly related to the K-band arms found in the\nsame region. We find evidence of non-circular motions in the inner 20'' which\nare consistent with gas on elliptical orbits in a bar.",

Motivated by this possibility and its implications for neutron-star\nstructural properties, we calculate new optimal bounds on the masses, radii,\nand moments of inertia of slowly rotating neutron stars that show kilohertz\nquasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). These bounds are derived under minimal\nassumptions about the properties of matter at high densities and therefore are\nlargely independent of the unknown equation of state. We further derive a\nsemi-analytical upper bound on the neutron-star moment of inertia without\nmaking any assumptions about the equation of state of matter at any density. We\nuse this upper bound to show that the maximum possible nodal precession\nfrequency of an inclined circular orbit around a slowly spinning neutron star\nis nu_{NP}~45.2 (nu_s/300Hz) Hz, where nu_s is the spin frequency of the\nneutron star. We conclude that the nodal-precession interpretation of\nlow-frequency QPOs in accreting neutron stars is inconsistent with their\ninferred spin frequencies or the identification of the highest-frequency QPO\nwith that of a circular Keplerian orbit in the accretion disk.",

Neglecting electromagnetism, we describe the\ndifferent baryonic and quark matter phases at zero temperature. For quark\nmatter, we support our model-independent arguments with a quantitative analysis\nof a model which uses a four-fermion interaction abstracted from single-gluon\nexchange. For any finite m_s, at sufficiently large mu we find quark matter in\na color-flavor locked state which leaves a global vector-like SU(2)_{color+L+R}\nsymmetry unbroken. As a consequence, chiral symmetry is always broken in\nsufficiently dense quark matter. As the density is reduced, for sufficiently\nlarge m_s we observe a first order transition from the color-flavor locked\nphase to a color superconducting phase analogous to that in two flavor QCD. At\nthis unlocking transition chiral symmetry is restored. For realistic values of\nm_s our analysis indicates that chiral symmetry breaking may be present for all\ndensities down to those characteristic of baryonic matter. This supports the\nidea that quark matter and baryonic matter may be continuously connected in\nnature. We map the gaps at the quark Fermi surfaces in the high density\ncolor-flavor locked phase onto gaps at the baryon Fermi surfaces at low\ndensities.",

The central role in these descriptions is played by d-bases,\none of two principal tools utilized in our work [{\\it Inverses of Disjointness\nPreserving Operators}, Memoirs of the Amer. Math. Soc., forthcoming]. The\nconcept of a d-basis has been applied so far only to vector lattices with a\nlarge amount of projection bands. The absence of the projection bands has been\nthe major obstacle for extending, otherwise very useful concept of d-bases, to\narbitrary vector lattices. In Section~4 we overcome this obstacle by finding a\nnew way to introduce d-independence in an arbitrary vector lattice. This allows\nus to produce a new definition of a d-basis which is free of the existence of\nprojection bands. We illustrate this by proving several results devoted to\ncardinality of d-bases. Theorems~4.13 and~4.15 are the main of them and they\nassert that, under very general conditions, a vector lattice either has a\nsingleton d-basis of else this d-basis must be infinite.",

Dark halos appear to\nextend to at least ~50 kpc with total enclosed masses that rise linearly with\nradius R. Whether this behavior can be extrapolated to distances as large as\n200 kpc and beyond is controversial; results at this radius are\nmodel-dependent. Observationally, the geometrical form of the dark halo can be\ncharacterized by the equatorial axis ratio b/a (ovalness) and\nvertical-to-equatorial axis ratio c/a (flattening) of the total density.\nDifferent techniques consistently yield b/a > 0.7 (and thus b/a > 0.9 for the\npotential) at R~20 kpc, with more axisymmetric values, b/a >~ 0.8, being more\nlikely. Results are less consistent for the vertical flattening, perhaps due to\nthe difference in the spatial regions probed by different techniques or\ninappropriate assumptions. Techniques that probe furthest from the stellar\nplane z~15 kpc consistently implicate substantially flattened c/a = 0.5 +/- 0.2\ndark halos.

We introduce the concept of an effective detuning,\nwhich for moderate interpulse times provides a qualitative understanding of the\nnew features.",

We show\nthat the presence of such long-lived superheavy particles is a generic\nprediction of QCD-like SU(N_c) gauge theories with N_f flavors of quarks and\nantiquarks and the large number of colors N_c. We construct explicit models\nbased on supersymmetric SU(N_c) gauge theories and show that if the dynamical\nscale $\\Lambda \\simeq 10^{13}-10^{14} GeV$ and N_c = 6-10 the lightest\ncomposite baryons have the desired masses and lifetimes to explain the UHE\ncosmic rays.

Its main ingredients are a library\nof abstract datatypes corresponding to the algebraic structures used in the\nmathematical theory and an algebraic expression style similar to the expression\nstyle used in the mathematical theory. Because of its emphasis on abstract\ndatatypes, Sophus is most naturally combined with object-oriented languages or\nother languages supporting abstract datatypes. The resulting source code\npatterns are beyond the scope of current compiler optimizations, but are\nsufficiently specific for a dedicated source-to-source optimizer. The limited,\ndomain-specific, character of Sophus is the key to success here. This kind of\noptimization has been tested on computationally intensive Sophus style code\nwith promising results.

It is shown that for wide\nbinaries, the lensing in the vicinity of both lens objects can be described by\na Taylor-expansion of the deflection term due to the other object, where the\nChang-Refsdal approximation corresponds to a truncation of this series. For\nclose binaries, only the vicinity of the secondary, less massive, object can be\ndescribed in this way. However, for image distances much larger than the\nseparation of the lens objects, any binary lens can be approximated by means of\nmultipole expansion, where the first non-trivial term is the quadrupole term.\nIt is shown that an ambiguity exists between wide and close binary lenses,\nwhere the shear at one of the objects due to the other object for the wide\nbinary is equal to the absolute value of the eigenvalues of the quadrupole\nmoment for the close binary. This analysis provides the basis for a\nclassification of binary lens microlensing events, especially of planetary\nevents, and an understanding of present ambiguities.",

A\ncomparison of our data with the RGBs of Galactic globular clusters gives a mean\nmetal abundance [Fe/H] = -1.81+/-0.10 dex. The presence of an intrinsic color\ndispersion in the upper red RGB suggests an abundance range of about 0.5 dex,\nalthough a range in age may also affect the RGB width.

The HB is predominantly red yet moderately\nextended to the blue, which indicates the presence of a significant population\nwith age comparable to that of old halo GGCs. This HB morphology in a\nmetal-poor system indicates a mild \"second parameter\" effect. From the mean\nlevel of the HB we derived a true distance modulus 23.21+/-0.08, in good\nagreement with the distance modulus 23.04+/-0.07 estimated from the cutoff of\nthe RGB at I~23.1.

Their number indicates that the fraction of\nintermediate age population in Phoenix is approximately 30-40%. A young stellar\npopulation is definitely present in Phoenix, consistent with a star formation\nepisode started at least 0.6 Gyr ago, up to 1x10^{8} yr ago.

From a\nnon-LTE model atmosphere analysis of the stellar spectrum, we derive Teff=31kK,\nlog(Mdot/(Msun yr))=-6.05, v_inf=160 km/s and abundance number ratios of\nH/He<0.5, C/He=0.60 and O/He=0.10.

Assuming an identical stellar mass to that determined by De\nMarco et al. for He2-113, we obtain a distance of 6.8kpc to M4-18\n(E(B-V)=0.55mag from nebular and stellar techniques). This implies that the\nplanetary nebula of M4-18 has a dynamical age of 3100 years, in contrast to\n>270 years for He2-113. This is supported by the much higher electron density\nof the latter. These observations may only be reconciled with evolutionary\npredictions if [WC]-type stars exhibit a range in stellar masses.\n  Photo-ionization modelling of M4-18 is carried out using our stellar WR flux\ndistribution, together with blackbody and Kurucz energy distributions obtained\nfrom Zanstra analyses.

Like HUT spectra of this source, the\nFUV and UV spectra reveal broad emission lines of He II, C II-IV, N III and V,\nO VI, Si III-IV, and Al III superposed on a continuum which is blue in the UV\nand nearly flat in the FUV. Like ORFEUS spectra of AM Her, the O VI doublet is\nresolved into broad and narrow emission components. Consistent with its\nbehavior in the optical, the FUV and UV continuum flux densities, the FUV and\nUV broad emission line fluxes, and the radial velocity of the O VI broad\nemission component all vary on the spin phase of the white dwarf, with the\nmaximum of the FUV and UV continuum and broad emission line flux light curves\ncoincident with maximum blueshift of the broad O VI emission component. On the\nbinary phase, the broad dip in the EUV light curve is accompanied by strong\neclipses of the UV emission lines and by variations in both the flux and radial\nvelocity of the O VI narrow emission component. The available data are\nconsistent with the accretion funnel being the source of the FUV and UV\ncontinuum and the O VI broad emission component, and the white dwarf being the\nsource of the O VI narrow emission component.",

It is shown that the ghost fields are indispensable in deriving\nwell-defined antiderivatives and in regularizing the most singular component of\ngauge field propagator. To this end it is sufficient to confine ourselves to\nnoninteracting abelian fields. Furthermore to circumvent dealing with\nconstrained systems, we construct the temporal gauge canonical formulation of\nthe free electromagnetic field in auxiliary coordinates\n$x^{\\mu}=(x^-,x^+,x^1,x^2)$ where $x^-=x^0 cos{\\theta}-x^3 sin{\\theta}, x^+=x^0\nsin{\\theta}+x^3 cos{\\theta}$ and $x^-$ plays the role of time. In so doing we\ncan quantize the fields canonically without any constraints, unambiguously\nintroduce \"static ghost fields\" as residual gauge degrees of freedom and\nconstruct the light-cone gauge solution in the light-cone representation by\nsimply taking the light-cone limit (${\\theta}\\to \\pi/4$).

We present an alternate\ncosmology, one based on conformal gravity, and show that once given only that\nthe sign of the vacuum energy density $\\Lambda$ is explicitly the negative one\nassociated with spontaneous breakdown of the scale invariance of the conformal\ntheory (this actually being the choice of sign for $\\Lambda$ which precisely\nleads to cosmic acceleration in conformal gravity), then that alone, no matter\nhow big $\\Lambda$ might actually be in magnitude, is sufficient to not only\nmake its measurable contribution to current era cosmology naturally be of order\none today, but to even do so in a way which is completely compatible with the\nrecent high $z$ supernovae cosmology data. Cosmology can thus live with either\na fundamental $G$ or with the large (and even potentially negative) $\\Lambda$\nassociated with elementary particle physics phase transitions but not with\nboth. Also, we distinguish between the free energy and the internal energy,\nwith it being the former which determines cosmological phase transitions and\nthe latter which is the source of the gravitational field.

It has been suggested that the string scale could be as low as a\nTeV. In this note, we explore constraints on these scenarios. We argue that the\nmost plausible cases have a fundamental scale of at least 10 TeV and five\ndimensions of inverse size 10 MeV. We show that a radial dilaton mass in the\nrange of proposed millimeter scale gravitational arises naturally in these\nscenarios. Most other scenarios require huge values of flux and may not be\nrealizable in M Theory. Existing precision experiments put a conservative lower\nbound of 6-10 TeV on the fundamental energy scale. We note that large\ndimensions with bulk supersymmetry might be a natural framework for\nquintessence, and make some other tentative remarks about cosmology.",

However, age estimates of individual dwarfs and the luminosity\nfunction of Oswalt et al (1995) are both consistent with disk ages as large as\n\\sim 11 Gyr. We have also used our models to place constraints on white dwarf\ndark matter in Galactic halos. We find that previous attempts using inadequate\ncooling models were too severe and that direct detection limits allow a halo\nthat is 11 Gyr old. If the halo is composed solely of helium atmosphere dwarfs,\nthe lower age limit is only 7.5 Gyr.

The kinetic equation includes collisions between the\ncondensate and non-condensate atoms ($C_{12}$), in addition to collisions\nbetween the excited atoms as described by the Uehling-Uhlenbeck ($C_{22}$)\ncollision integral. Assuming that the $C_{22}$ collision rate is sufficiently\nrapid to produce a local equilibrium Bose distribution, the kinetic equation\ncan be used to derive hydrodynamic equations for the non-condensate. These\nequations include a description of the equilibration of the local chemical\npotentials of the condensate and non-condensate components which gives rise to\na new relaxational mode associated with the exchange of atoms between the two\ncomponents. We show how the Landau two-fluid equations emerge in the frequency\ndomain $\\omega \\tau_\\mu \\ll 1$, where $\\tau_\\mu$ is a characteristic relaxation\ntime of the equilibration process. This process provides an additional source\nof damping of the collective modes (first and second sound in the case of a\nuniform system).

In the\nabsence of ab initio theory, the surprises embodied in the experimental data\nwere imputed to effects of dynamical correlations. We summarize results of ab\ninitio investigations of linear response, performed within time-dependent\ndensity-functional theory (TDDFT), in which the unexpected features of the\nobserved spectra are shown to be due to band-structure effects. Contrary to\nconventional wisdom, the response cannot be understood \"universally,\" in terms\nof a simple scaling with the density, on going from metal to metal (e.g.,\nthrough the alkali series) --even the shape of the dispersion curve for the\nplasmon energy is system-specific. The second part of this article starts out\nwith the observation that a similar ab initio study of systems with more\ncomplex electronic structures would require the availability of a realistic\napproximation for the dynamical many-body kernel entering the density-response\nfunction in TDDFT. Thus, we outline a diagrammatic alternative, framed within\nthe conserving-approximation method of Baym and Kadanoff. Using as a benchmark\nthe band gap of Si obtained in the GW approximation, together with a\ndiagrammatic (and conserving) solution of the ensuing Bethe-Salpeter equation,\nwe discuss issues involving conservation laws, self-consistency, and sum rules.\nThese conceptual issues are particularly important for the development of ab\ninitio methods for the study of dynamical response and quasiparticle band\nstructure of strongly-correlated materials. We argue that inclusion of\nshort-range correlations absent in the GW approximation is a must, even in Si.",

    "summary": "A study of the stellar population of the M31 spiral arm around OB association\nA24 was carried out based on the photometric data obtained from deep V and JHK\nimaging. The luminosity function was obtained for -7 <~ Mbol <~ -3.5 by\napplying the extinction correction corresponding to Av=1 and the bolometric\ncorrection BC(K) as an empirical function of (J-K)o. In comparing the observed\ncolor-luminosity diagrams with semitheoretical isochrones modified for the\ndust-shell effects, we found the young population of t <~ 30 Myr with\nsupergiants of Mbol <~ -5, the bulk of the intermediate-age population of t ~\n0.2 - 2.5 Gyr with bright asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars of -5 <~ Mbol <~\n-4, and old populations of t ~> 3 Gyr with AGB and red giant branch (RGB) stars\nof Mbol ~> -4. The average star formation rate was estimated to be ~1.8x10^4\nM_o/Myr and ~0.7x10^4 M_o/Myr per deprojected disk area of 1 kpc^2 from the\nnumber density of B0 V stars around Mv=-4.0 (age ~10 Myr) and the number\ndensity of bright AGB stars around Mbol = -4.3 (age ~1 Gyr), respectively. A\nstudy of the local variation in the V and the J and H luminosity functions\nrevealed a kind of anticorrelation between the population of the young\ncomponent and that of the intermediate-age component when subdomains of ~100 pc\nscales were concerned. This finding suggests that the disk domain around the\nA24 area experienced a series of star formation episodes alternatively among\ndifferent subdomains with a timescale of a few spiral passage periods. Brief\ndiscussions are given about the interstellar extinction and about the lifetimes\nof bright AGB stars and the highly red objects (HROs) in the same area.",

The influence\nof thermal fluctuations on single vortices is investigated. Different types of\nnoise and damping are discussed and implemented into the microscopic equations\nwhich yields stochastic equations of motion for the vortices. The solutions of\nthe these equations are compared with Langevin dynamics simulations. Moreover,\nnoise-induced transitions between opposite polarizations of a vortex are\ninvestigated. For temperatures above the Kosterlitz-Thouless vortex-antivortex\nunbinding transition, a phenomenological theory, namely the vortex gas\napproach, yields central peaks in the dynamic form factors for the spin\ncorrelations.

    "summary": "We consider a jet-disk symbiosis model to explain Gamma Ray Bursts and their\nafterglows. It is proposed that GRBs develop in a pre-existing jet. We consider\na binary system formed by a neutron star and an O/B/WR companion in which the\nenergy of the GRB is due to the accretion-induced collapse of the neutron star\nto a black hole. The high speed in the energy flow in AGN-jets is generally\nbelieved to be initiated by strong magnetic field coupling to the accretion\ndisk of the black hole. We use the same mechanism here. We assume that in this\ntransition a large amount of energy is anisotropically released as Poynting\nflux along the polar axis. One may think of this process as a violent and rapid\ntwist. This energy release naturally initiates an ultrarelativistic shock wave\nin the pre-existing jet. The emission microphysics are as in fireball models.\nOur model has only two parameters overall, the energy in the shock along the\njet, and the fraction of this energy in energetic electrons and positrons. The\nsystem SS433 appears to have the properties required for a GRB precursor in our\nmodel. We show that our model can explain the initial gamma ray burst\nenergetics, the spectrum and temporal behaviour of the afterglows, the low\nbaryon load, and do all this with a modest energy budget.",

However, if multiple topological images of a cluster\nexist, then the radial positions and sky plane mean velocities of galaxies in\nthe cluster may also be measurable from photometry of the two cluster images.\n  The vector arithmetic and principles of the analysis are presented. These are\ndemonstrated by assuming the suggested topological identification of the\nclusters RX J1347.5-1145 and CL 09104+4109 to be correct and deducing the\nsky-plane relative velocity component along the axis common to both images of\nthis would-be single cluster.\n  Three out of four of the inferred transverse velocities are consistent with\nthose expected in a rich cluster. A control sample of random `common' sky-plane\naxes, independent of the topological hypothesis, implies that this is not\nsurprising. This shows that while galaxy kinematics are deducible from\nknowledge of cosmological topology, it is not easy to use them to refute a\nspecific candidate manifold.",

Viewed from this perspective, the significance of\nultraluminous galaxies and the `starburst vs. monster' debate becomes clear.\nUltraluminous galaxies are fascinating in their own right, allow detailed study\nof the processes by which massive spheroids were built and the IGM was heated\nand polluted, and resemble the most luminous and dustiest galaxies at\nhigh-redshift. Ultraluminous galaxies were apparently far more common at z\n$\\sim$ 3 than today. Recent inventories in the local universe of the cumulative\neffect of nuclear burning (metal production) and of monster-feeding (compact\ndark objects in galactic nuclei) imply that either stars or monsters could have\ngenerated the observed far-IR cosmic background. The starburst vs. monster\ndebate has global, as well as local importance.",

    "summary": "Deterministic coarse-grained descriptions of driven diffusive systems (DDS)\nhave been hampered by apparent inconsistencies with kinetic Ising models of\nDDS. In the evolution towards the driven steady-state, ``triangular''\nanisotropies in the two systems point in opposite directions with respect to\nthe drive field. We show that this is non-universal behavior in the sense that\nthe triangular anisotropy ``flips'' with local modifications of the Ising\ninteractions. The sign and magnitude of the triangular anisotropy also vary\nwith temperature. We have also flipped the anisotropy of coarse-grained models,\nthough not yet at the latest stages of evolution. Our results illustrate the\ncomparison of deterministic coarse-grained and stochastic Ising DDS studies to\nidentify universal phenomena in driven systems. Coarse-grained systems are\nparticularly attractive in terms of analysis and computational efficiency.",

    "summary": "We present evidence that the integrated profiles of some millisecond pulsars\nexhibit severe changes that are inconsistent with the moding phenomenon as\nknown from slowly rotating pulsars. We study these profile instabilities in\nparticular for PSR J1022+1001 and show that they occur smoothly, exhibiting\nlonger time constants than those associated with moding. In addition, the\nprofile changes of this pulsar seem to be associated with a relatively\nnarrow-band variation of the pulse shape. Only parts of the integrated profile\nparticipate in this process which suggests that the origin of this phenomenon\nis intrinsic to the pulsar magnetosphere and unrelated to the interstellar\nmedium. A polarization study rules out profile changes due to geometrical\neffects produced by any sort of precession. However, changes are observed in\nthe circularly polarized radiation component. In total we identify four\nrecycled pulsars which also exhibit instabilities in the total power or\npolarization profiles due to an unknown phenomenon (PSRs J1022+1001,\nJ1730-2304, B1821-24, J2145-0750).\n  The consequences for high precision pulsar timing are discussed in view of\nthe standard assumption that the integrated profiles of millisecond pulsars are\nstable. As a result we present a new method to determine pulse times-of-arrival\nthat involves an adjustment of relative component amplitudes of the template\nprofile. Applying this method to PSR J1022+1001, we obtain an improved timing\nsolution with a proper motion measurement of -17 \\pm 2 mas/yr in ecliptic\nlongitude. Assuming a distance to the pulsar as inferred from the dispersion\nmeasure this corresponds to an one-dimensional space velocity of 50 km/s.",

In this picture the\nstandard model fields are localized to a $(3+1)$-dimensional wall or\n``3-brane''. We show that in such theories there exist attractive models of\ninflation that occur while the size of the new dimensions are still small. We\nshow that it is easy to produce the required number of efoldings, and further\nthat the density perturbations $\\delta\\rho/\\rho$ as measured by COBE can be\neasily reproduced, both in overall magnitude and in their approximately\nscale-invariant spectrum. In the minimal approach, the inflaton field is just\nthe moduli describing the size of the internal dimensions, the role of the\ninflationary potential being played by the stabilizing potential of the\ninternal space. We show that under quite general conditions, the inflationary\nera is followed by an epoch of contraction of our world on the brane, while the\ninternal dimensions slowly expand to their stabilization radius. We find a set\nof exact solutions which describe this behavior, generalizing the well-known\nKasner solutions. During this phase, the production of bulk gravitons remains\nsuppressed. The period of contraction is terminated by the blue-shifting of\nHawking radiation left on our wall at the end of the inflationary de Sitter\nphase.

The method is\nbased on an observed correlation between the ratio of far infrared (FIR) to UV\nfluxes with spectral slope \\beta (a UV color). A simple fit to this relation\nallows the UV flux absorbed by dust to be calculated, and hence the dust-free\nUV luminosity to be determined. IUE spectra and IRAS fluxes of local starbursts\nare used to calibrate the ratio in terms of 1600 Angstrom absorption A_{1600},\nand the transformation from broad band color to \\beta. We show that the recent\nmarginal and non-detections of HDF U-dropouts in the radio and sub-mm are\nconsistent with our calculated A_{1600}. This is also true of observations of\nthe ratio of optical emission line flux to UV flux density in the brightest\nU-dropouts. This latter ratio turns out not to be a good indicator of dust\nextinction. In U-dropouts, absolute magnitude correlates with \\beta: brighter\ngalaxies are redder, as is observed in local starburst galaxies. This suggests\nthat a mass-metallicity relationship is in place by z ~ 3. The UV luminosity\nfunction of U-dropouts extends up to M_{1600,0} ~ -24 ABmag corresponding to a\nstar formation rate ~ 200 \\Msun/yr (H_0 = 50 km/s/Mpc, q_0 = 0.5). The\nabsorption-corrected UV luminosity density at z ~ 3 is \\rho_{1600,0} =>\n1.4x10^{27} erg/s/Hz/Mpc^3; still a lower limit since completeness corrections\nhave not been done and because only galaxies with A_{1600} < ~3.6 mag are blue\nenough to be selected as U-dropouts.

We find an empirical model able\nto represent coherently all the non-harmonic lines we have found in the power\nspectrum, in terms of an assumed reference signal of the primary supply input\nsignal. If this signal is not available then it can be reconstructed from the\nsame data by making use of the coherent line removal algorithm that we have\ndescribed elsewhere. All these lines are broadened by frequency changes of the\nsupply signal, and they corrupt significant frequency ranges of the power\nspectrum. The physical process that generates this interference is so far\nunknown, but it is highly non-linear and non-stationary. Using our model, we\ncancel the interference in the time domain by an adaptive procedure that should\nwork regardless of the source of the primary interference. We have applied the\nmethod to laser interferometer data from the Glasgow prototype detector, where\nall the features we describe in this paper were observed. The algorithm has\nbeen tuned in such a way that the entire series of wide lines corresponding to\nthe electrical interference are removed, leaving the spectrum clean enough to\ndetect signals previously masked by them.

From the surface (i.e. projected) brightness\nprofile one then formally recovers the original spatial distribution as a\nfunction of the toroidal radius. 2) By applying the above-described inversion\nformula, I show that if the projected profile is described by a truncated\noff-center gaussian, the functional form of the related spatial emissivity is\nvery simple and - most important - nowhere negative for any value of the\ngaussian parameters, a property which is not guaranteed - in general - by Abel\ninversion. 3) Finally, I show how a generic multimodal centrally symmetric\nbrightness distribution can be deprojected using a sum of truncated off-center\ngaussians, recovering the spatial emissivity as a sum of nowhere negative\ntoroidal distributions.",

The more usual method consists in performing an expansion around an\ninstantaneous approximation of the product of the free propagators\n(propagator-approximated reduction). The second method starts with an\ninstantaneous approximation of the Bethe-Salpeter kernel (kernel-approximated\nreduction). In both reductions the final 3D potential can be obtained by\nfollowing simple modified Feynman rules. The kernel-approximated reduction,\nhowever, does not give the correct scattering amplitudes, and must thus be\nlimited to the computation of bound states. Our 3D reduction of the\nthree-fermion Bethe-Salpeter equation is inspired by these results. We expand\nthis equation around positive-energy instantaneous approximations of the three\ntwo-body kernels, but these starting approximations are given by\npropagator-approximated reductions at the two-body level. The three-fermion\nBethe-Salpeter equation is first transformed into a set of three coupled\nequations for three wave functions depending each on one two-fermion total\nenergy, then into a set of three 3D equations and finally into a single 3D\nequation.

In this way he verified the existence of that\nanisotropy even for such a case where the Kondo effect is not dominating. For\ndetailed comparison of that suggestion with experiments, the magnetic field\ndependence of the magnetoresistance is calculated in the lowest approximation,\nthus in the second order of the exchange coupling.

We concentrated on stars having a narrow range of\neffective temperature and very low metallicities ([Fe/H] < -2.5) to reduce the\neffects of systematic errors, and have made particular efforts to minimize\nrandom errors in equivalent width and effective temperature. A typical formal\nerror for our abundances is 0.033 dex (1-sigma), which represents a factor of\ntwo improvement on most previous studies. Our observed spread about the Li\nSpite plateau is a mere 0.031 dex (1-sigma), hence we conclude the intrinsic\nspread is effectively zero at the very metal-poor halo turnoff. We recover a\nrobust dependence of lithium abundance with metallicity, dA(Li)/d[Fe/H] = 0.118\n+/- 0.023 dex per dex. Previous claims for a lack of dependence of A(Li) on\n[Fe/H] are shown to have arisen from the use of noisier estimates of effective\ntemperatures and metallicities. Although we cannot rule out a uniform depletion\nmechanism, the lack of spread in the A(Li) abundances limits permissible\ndepletion by current rotationally- induced mixing models to < 0.1 dex.\nCorrecting for the GCE contribution to both 6Li and 7Li, we infer a primordial\nlithium abundance of A(Li) = 2.0 dex. We predict that observations of lithium\nin extremely low-metallicity stars, having [Fe/H] < -3.0, will yield smaller\nA(Li) values than the bulk of the stars in this sample, consistent with a low\nprimordial abundance.",

We develope a\nmean-field theory in the strong rung interaction regime, i.e. $J_{\\perp}\\gg J,\nt$, which provides a unified description of the undoped insulating phase and\nthe low doping phase --- the so-called C1S0 phase. Both of them are\ncharacterized by the resonating-valence-bond (RVB) order parameter, with gap\nopened up in all spin excitations. The ground state of the doped phase is\nintrinsically a superconductor with a d-wave symmetry, which is driven by the\nRVB correlations. The ground-state energy is in good agreement with numerical\nresults. Phase separation is shown to occur beyond some critical value of J/t\nfor given doping concentration. We also show that the spin gap in the doped\nphase is determined by quasi-particle-like excitations. The local structure of\nhole pairs as well as the spectra of various spin and charge modes are analyzed\nin comparison with other approaches.",

Using a well-studied barred spiral\ngalaxy mass model, we briefly review the orbital properties of two-dimensional\nnon-axisymmetric disks and identify the main families of periodic orbits. We\nuse those families as building blocks to model real galaxies and calculate the\nPVDs obtained for various realistic combinations of periodic orbit families and\nfor a number of viewing angles with respect to the bar. We show that the global\nstructure of the PVD is a reliable bar diagnostic in edge-on disks.\nSpecifically, the presence of a gap between the signatures of the families of\nperiodic orbits in the PVD follows directly from the non-homogeneous\ndistribution of the orbits in a barred galaxy. Similarly, material in the two\nso-called forbidden quadrants of the PVD results from the elongated shape of\nthe orbits. We show how the shape of the signatures of the dominant x1 and x2\nfamilies of periodic orbits in the PVD can be used efficiently to determine the\nviewing angle with respect to the bar and, to a lesser extent, to constrain the\nmass distribution of an observed galaxy. We also address the limitations of the\nmodels when interpreting observational data.",

Deficits of the atmospheric muon neutrino flux and the\nsolar electron neutrino flux compared to their predicted values can be\nunderstood in terms of neutrino oscillations and we can therefore infer that\nneutrinos have non-degenerate masses. Additional but somewhat less secure\nevidence for \\bar\\nu_\\mu \\to \\bar\\nu_e and \\nu_\\mu\\to\\nu_e oscillations has\nbeen found in the LSND accelerator experiment. Because these experiments have\nwidely different L/E_\\nu ranges (\\approx 10 to 10^4 km/GeV for atmospheric,\n\\approx 10^{11} for solar, and \\approx 1 for LSND), the mass-squared\ndifferences required to explain the phenomena must be distinct. Given the\nobservations, an important next step is to deduce the pattern of neutrino\nmasses and mixings. Such studies depend on the number of neutrinos. The\ninvisible width of the Z-boson measured in LEP experiments gives N_\\nu =\n2.993\\pm 0.011, consistent with the usual \\nu_e, \\nu_\\mu and \\nu_\\tau \"active\"\nneutrinos. But there may also be right-handed \"sterile\" neutrinos with no weak\ninteractions. Only the observation of oscillations of the active neutrinos to\nsterile neutrinos can test for their existence. In the following, we first\ndiscuss the atmospheric and solar neutrino data in a 3-neutrino framework and\nthen later generalize our considerations to include the LSND data with\noscillations of four neutrinos.",

The main sequence\nreaches ~2 magnitudes below the main-sequence turnoff (V_TO ~ 23.27 +- 0.11\nmag) of the median stellar population. We compare the fiducial sequence of Ursa\nMinor with the fiducial sequence of the Galactic globular cluster M92 (NGC\n6341). The excellent match between Ursa Minor and M92 confirms that the median\nstellar population of the UMi dSph galaxy is metal poor ([Fe/H]_UMi ~\n[Fe/H]_M92 ~ -2.2 dex) and ancient (age_UMi ~ age_M92 ~ 14 Gyr). The B-V\nreddening and the absorption in V are estimated to be E(B-V) = 0.03 +- 0.01 mag\nand A_V = 0.09 +- 0.03 mag. A new estimate of the distance modulus of Ursa\nMinor, (m-M)_0 = 19.18 +- 0.12 mag, has been derived based on fiducial-sequence\nfitting with M92 and the adoption of the apparent V distance modulus for M92 of\n(m-M)_V = 14.67 +- 0.08 mag (Pont et al. 1998, A&A, 329, 87).

The clusters consist of\norder 2.5e+05 particles of mass $m_p \\simeq 10^{10} \\Msun$, have triaxial mass\ndistributions, and significant substructure exists within their virial radii.\nNot surprisingly, the level of agreement between the mass profiles obtained\nfrom the various estimators and the actual mass profiles is found to be\nscale-dependent.\n  The virial estimator yields a good measurement of the total cluster mass,\nthough it is systematically underestimated by of order 10%. This result\nsuggests that, at least in the limit of ideal data, the virial estimator is\nquite robust to deviations from pure spherical symmetry and the presence of\nsubstructure. The dynamical mass estimate based upon a measurement of the\ncluster velocity dispersion and an assumption of an isothermal potential yields\na poor measurement of the total mass. The weak lensing estimate yields a very\ngood measurement of the total mass, provided the mean shear used to determine\nthe equivalent cluster velocity dispersion is computed from an average of the\nlensing signal over the entire cluster (i.e. the mean shear is computed\ninterior to the virial radius).

High resolution spectroscopic observations by Ramrez et\nal. (1998) of luminous M stars in this region yield a near solar value for\n[Fe/H] from direct measurements of iron lines. Then I will present some results\nfrom an ongoing program by my colleagues and myself which has the objective of\ndelineating the star formation and chemical enrichment histories of the central\n100 parsecs of the Galaxy, the ``inner bulge''. We have found a small increase\nin mean [Fe/H] from Baade's Window to the Galactic Center and deduce a near\nsolar value for stars at the center. For radial distances greater than one\ndegree we fail to find a measurable population of stars that are significantly\nyounger than those in Baade's Window. Within one degree of the Galactic Center\nwe find a number of luminous M giants that most likely are the result of a star\nformation episode not more than one or two Gyr ago.",

Such\na mass influx impacts the long-term behavior of the disk by providing\nadditional sources of viscosity and heating. Here, we make improvements over\nthis earlier work by incorporating the results of 3D hydrodynamical simulations\nof the large scale accretion from an ambient medium into the disk evolution\nequations developed previously. We discuss two models, one with the axis of the\ndisk parallel to, and the second with the axis oriented perpendicular to the\nlarge scale Bondi-Hoyle flow. We find that the mass inflow rate onto the disk\nwithin logarithmic annuli is roughly constant with radius and that the\nimpacting wind carries much less specific angular momentum than Keplerian. We\nalso find, in general, that the infrared spectrum of a wind-fed disk system is\nsteeper than that of a Shakura-Sunyaev configuration, due mainly to the\ndissipation of the wind's kinetic energy at the disk's surface. In applying our\nresults to the Galactic Center black hole candidate, Sgr A*, we demonstrate\nthat a high wind inflow rate of order 10^-4 solar masses per year cannot be\nincorporated into a fossil disk without a significant dissipation of kinetic\nenergy at all radii. Such a high dissipation would violate current infrared and\nnear-infrared limits on the observed spectrum of Sgr A*.",

If we\nrestrict the head of the automaton to moving classically and to moving only in\none direction, the acceptance power of this 1-way quantum finite automaton is\nreduced to a proper subset of the regular languages.\n  In this paper we study two different models of 1-way quantum finite automata.\nThe first model, termed measure-once quantum finite automata, was introduced by\nMoore and Crutchfield, and the second model, termed measure-many quantum finite\nautomata, was introduced by Kondacs and Watrous.\n  We characterize the measure-once model when it is restricted to accepting\nwith bounded error and show that, without that restriction, it can solve the\nword problem over the free group. We also show that it can be simulated by a\nprobabilistic finite automaton and describe an algorithm that determines if two\nmeasure-once automata are equivalent.\n  We prove several closure properties of the classes of languages accepted by\nmeasure-many automata, including inverse homomorphisms, and provide a new\nnecessary condition for a language to be accepted by the measure-many model\nwith bounded error. Finally, we show that piecewise testable languages can be\naccepted with bounded error by a measure-many quantum finite automaton, in the\nprocess introducing new construction techniques for quantum automata.",

    "summary": "For smooth solutions to Maxwell's equations sourced by a smooth\ncharge-current distribution $j_a$ in stationary, asymptotically flat\nspacetimes, one can prove an energy conservation theorem which asserts the\nvanishing of the sum of (i) the difference between the final and initial\nelectromagnetic self-energy of the charge distribution, (ii) the net\nelectromagnetic energy radiated to infinity (and/or into a black hole/white\nhole), and (iii) the total work done by the electromagnetic field on the charge\ndistribution via the Lorentz force. A similar conservation theorem can be\nproven for linearized gravitational fields off of a stationary, asymptotically\nflat background, with the second order Einstein tensor playing the role of an\neffective stress-energy tensor of the linearized field. In this paper, we prove\nthe above theorems for smooth sources and then investigate the extent to which\nthey continue to hold for point particle sources. The ``self-energy'' of point\nparticles is ill defined, but in the electromagnetic case, we can consider\nsituations where, initially and finally, the point charges are stationary and\nin the same spatial position, so that the self-energy terms should cancel.\nUnder certain assumptions concerning the decay behavior of source-free\nsolutions to Maxwell's equations, we prove the vanishing of the sum of the net\nenergy radiated to infinity and the net work done on the particle by the\nDeWitt-Brehme radiation reaction force. We also obtain a similar conservation\ntheorem for angular momentum in an axisymmetric spacetime. In the gravitational\ncase, we argue that similar conservation results should hold for freely falling\npoint masses whose orbits begin and end at infinity.",

When the propagators in the Feynman integrals are replaced with\nthe approximate form all integrals over internal momenta and vertices are\nconverted into Gaussians, which can be evaluated analytically. Performing the\nGaussians yields a multi-dimensional infinite sum which approximates the\ncorresponding Feynman integral. The difference between the exact result and\nthis approximation is set by an adjustable parameter, and can be made\narbitrarily small. We discuss the extraction of regularization independent\nquantities and demonstrate, both in theory and practice, that these sums can be\nevaluated quickly, even for third or fourth order diagrams. Lastly, we survey\nstrategies for numerically evaluating the multi-dimensional sums. We illustrate\nthe method with specific examples, including the the second order sunset\ndiagram from quartic scalar field theory, and several higher-order diagrams.

Following the variational principle, we are\ninterested in the Gutzwiller parameters that minimize e.g. the expectation\nvalue of the energy. Rewriting the expectation value as a rational function in\nthe Gutzwiller parameters, we find a very efficient way for performing that\nminimization. The method can be used to optimize general Gutzwiller-type\nwavefunctions both, in variational and in fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo.",

    "summary": "We consider evolution of interstellar clouds in Local Group dwarf spheroidal\ngalaxies (dSphs) in the context of their observed star formation histories. The\nLocal Group dSphs generally experienced initial bursts of star formations in\ntheir formation epochs ($\\sim 15$ Gyr ago), when hot gas originating from the\nsupernovae can make the cold interstellar clouds evaporate. We find that the\nmaximum size of evaporating cloud is 10 pc. Thus, clouds larger than 10 pc can\nsurvive during the initial star formation. These surviving clouds can\ncontribute to the second star formation to produce ``intermediate-age ($\\sim$\n3--10 Gyr ago) stellar populations.'' Assuming that collisions between clouds\ninduce star formation and that the timescale of the second star formation is a\nfew Gyr, we estimate the total mass of the clouds. The total mass is about\n$10^{4}M_\\odot$, which is 1--3 orders of magnitude smaller than the typical\nstellar mass of a present dSph. This implies that the initial star formation is\ndominant over the second star formation, which is broadly consistent with the\nobserved star formation histories. However, the variety of the dSphs in their\nstar formation histories suggests that the effects of environments on the dSphs\nmay be important.",

The emission measures suggest that the remnant\nevolves in a cloudy medium and imply that the supernova progenitor might not be\na massive early-type star. The cool component is approaching ionization\nequilibrium. The ages estimated from the ionization parameters and dynamics are\nall much greater than the previous determination. We restore the X-ray maps\nusing the ASCA SIS data and compare them with the ROSAT HRI and the NRAO VLA\nSky Survey (NVSS) 20 cm maps.

Using the reduced density\nmatrix of the second order and a variational procedure, this way allows us to\nescape the inconsistency mentioned and operate with singular potentials of the\nLennard-Jones type. The derived expansion of the condensate depletion in powers\nof the boson density n=N/V reproduces the familiar result, while the expansion\nfor the mean energy per particle is of the new form: E=2\\pi \\hbar^2 a n/m\n[1+128/(15 \\sqrt{\\pi})\\sqrt{na^3}(1-5b/8a)+ ...], where a is the scattering\nlength and b>0 stands for one more characteristic length depending on the shape\nof the interaction potential (in particular, for the hard spheres a=b). All the\nconsideration concerns the zero temperature.",

A numerical analysis indicates\nthat the identification of time with the Liouville mode results in an expanding\nuniverse with matter which exhibits an inflationary phase, and `graceful exit'\nfrom it, tending asymptotically to a flat-metric fixed point.This fixed point\nis characterized by a dilaton configuration which, depending on the initial\nconditions, either decreases linearly with the cosmic time, or is a finite\nconstant. This implies that, in contrast to the critical string case, the\nstring coupling remains bounded during the exit from the inflationary phase,\nand, thus, the pertinent dynamics can be reliably described in terms of a\ntree-level string effective action. The r\\^ole of matter in inducing such\nphenomena is emphasized. It is also interesting to note that the asymptotic\nvalue of the vacuum energy, which in the $\\sigma$-model framework is identified\nwith the `running' central charge deficit, depends crucially on the set of\ninitial conditions. Thus, although preliminary, this toy model seems to share\nall the features expected to characterize a phenomenologically acceptable\ncosmological string model.",

Our theory starts\nout from similar but more general chemical assumptions to those of Eigen,\nnamely that catalytic replication can lead to a large population of long\nchains. In particular, our models incorporate the possibility of (i) direct\nchain growth, (ii) template-assisted synthesis and (iii) catalysis by RNA\nreplicase ribozymes, all with varying degrees of efficiency. However, in our\nmodels the reaction mechanisms are kept `open'; we do not assume the existence\nof closed hypercycles which sustain a population of long chains. Rather it is\nthe feasibility of the initial emergence of a self-sustaining set of RNA chains\nfrom monomeric nucleotides which is our prime concern. We confront directly the\ncentral nonlinear features of the problem, which have often been overlooked in\nprevious studies. Our detailed microscopic kinetic models lead to kinetic\nequations which are generalisations of the Becker-Doring system (BD) for the\nstep-wise growth of clusters or polymer chains; they lie within a general\ntheoretical framework which has recently been successfully applied to a wide\nrange of complex chemical problems. In fact, the most accurate model we\nconsider has BD aggregation terms, together with a general Smoluchowski\nfragmentation term to model the competing hydrolysis of RNA polymer chains. We\nconclude that, starting from reasonable initial conditions of monomeric\nnucleotide concentrations within a prebiotic soup and in an acceptable\ntimescale, it is possible for a self-replicating subset of polyribonucleotide\nchains to be selected, while less efficient replicators become extinct.",

    "summary": "A Higgs boson with mass below 150 GeV has a total decay width of less than 20\nMeV into accessible Standard Model states. This narrow width means that the\nusual branching fractions for such a light Higgs boson are highly susceptible\nto any new particles to which it has unsuppressed couplings. In particular,\nthere are many reasonable and interesting theoretical ideas that naturally\nimply an invisibly-decaying Higgs boson. The motivations include models with\nlight supersymmetric neutralinos, spontaneously broken lepton number,\nradiatively generated neutrino masses, additional singlet scalar(s), or\nright-handed neutrinos in the extra dimensions of TeV gravity. We discuss these\napproaches to model building and their implications for Higgs boson\nphenomenology in future Tevatron runs. We find, for example, that the Tevatron\nwith 30 fb^{-1} integrated luminosity can make a 3\\sigma observation in the l+\nl- plus missing transverse energy channel for a 125 GeV Higgs boson that is\nproduced with the same strength as the Standard Model Higgs boson but always\ndecays invisibly. We also analyze the b anti-b plus missing transverse energy\nfinal state signal and conclude that it is not as sensitive, but it may assist\nin excluding the possibility of an invisibly-decaying Higgs boson or enable\nconfirmation of an observed signal in the dilepton channel. We argue that a\ncomprehensive Higgs search at the Tevatron should include the possibility that\nthe Higgs boson decays invisibly.",

In this approach, a correlated\nlattice problem is reduced to a single-impurity Anderson model with additional\nself-consistent bosonic baths.

The Wigner-Weisskopf survival\namplitude, describing reversible quantum transitions, may be dominated by\nexponential type decay in pole approximation at times not too short or too\nlong, but, in the two channel case, for example, the pole residues are not\northogonal, and the evolution does not correspond to a semigroup (experiments\non the decay of the neutral $K$-meson system strongly support the semigroup\nevolution postulated by Lee, Oehme and Yang, and Yang and Wu). The scattering\ntheory of Lax and Phillips, originally developed for classical wave equations,\nhas been recently extended to the description of the evolution of resonant\nstates in the framework of quantum theory. The resulting evolution law of the\nunstable system is that of a semigroup, and the resonant state is a\nwell-defined function in the Lax-Phillips Hilbert space. In this paper we apply\nthis theory to a relativistically covariant quantum field theoretical form of\nthe (soluble) Lee model. We construct the translation representations with the\nhelp of the wave operators, and show that the resulting Lax-Phillips $S$-matrix\nis an inner function (the Lax-Phillips theory is essentially a theory of\ntranslation invariant subspaces). In the special case that the $S$-matrix is a\nrational inner function, we obtain the resonant state explicitly and analyze\nits particle ($V, N, \\theta$) content. If there is an exponential bound, the\ngeneral case differs only by a so-called trivial inner factor, which does not\nchange the complex spectrum, but may affect the wave function of the resonant\nstate.",

We determine the form\nof the FI term, construct explicit examples of (non-Abelian) D and F flat\ndirections, and determine the surviving gauge groups of the restabilized vacua.\nWe also determine the mass spectra, for which the restabilization reduces the\nnumber of families.",

In Hall bar measurements, the\nanisotropy ratio is found to be much smaller (roughly 5).

    "summary": "A strongly-driven ($\\Omega >> \\gamma$) two level atom relaxes towards an\nequilibrium state rho which is almost completely mixed. One interpretation of\nthis state is that it represents an ensemble average, and that an individual\natom is at any time in one of the eigenstates of $\\rho$. The theory of Teich\nand Mahler [Phys. Rev. A 45, 3300 (1992)] makes this interpretation concrete,\nwith an individual atom jumping stochastically between the two eigenstates when\na photon is emitted. The dressed atom theory is also supposed to describe the\nquantum jumps of an individual atom due to photo-emissions. But the two\npictures are contradictory because the dressed states of the atom are almost\northogonal to the eigenstates of $\\rho$. In this paper we investigate three\nways of measuring the field radiated by the atom, which attempt to reproduce\nthe simple quantum jump dynamics of the dressed state or Teich and Mahler\nmodels. These are: spectral detection (using optical filters), two-state jumps\n(using adaptive homodyne detection) and orthogonal jumps (another adaptive\nhomodyne scheme). We find that the three schemes closely mimic the jumps of the\ndressed state model, with errors of order $(3/4) (\\gamma/\\Omega)^{2/3}$, $(1/4)\n(\\gamma/\\Omega)^{2}$, and $(3/4) (\\gamma/\\Omega)^{2}$ respectively.

In chapter 4, we show that factorization\nholds for the deeply virtual Compton scattering amplitude in QCD, up to power\nsuppressed terms, to all orders in perturbation theory.

Here we present a flux\nvariability analysis on several times-scales of the 233 hour data set\naccumulated over 213 nights (from March 1995 to July 1998) with the Whipple\nObservatory 10 m atmospheric Cherenkov imaging telescope. In 1995, with the\nexception of a single night, the flux from Markarian 501 was constant on daily\nand monthly time-scales and had an average flux of only 10% that of the Crab\nNebula, making it the weakest VHE source detected to date. In 1996, the average\nflux was approximately twice the 1995 flux and showed significant\nmonth-to-month variability. No significant day-scale variations were detected.\nThe average gamma-ray flux above ~350 GeV in the 1997 observing season rose to\n1.4 times that of the Crab Nebula -- 14 times the 1995 discovery level --\nallowing a search for variability on time-scales shorter than one day.\nSignificant hour-scale variability was present in the 1997 data, with the\nshortest, observed on MJD 50607, having a doubling time of ~2 hours. In 1998\nthe average emission level decreased considerably from that of 1997 (to ~20% of\nthe Crab Nebula flux) but two significant flaring events were observed. Thus,\nthe emission from Markarian 501 shows large amplitude and rapid flux\nvariability at very high energies as does Markarian 421. It also shows large\nmean flux level variations on year-to-year time-scales, behaviour which has not\nbeen seen from Markarian 421 so far.",

The focus here is on the geometric intuitions and on\nrelating group-theoretical diagrams to the traditional charts associated with\ncontext-free grammars and type-0 rewriting systems. The paper is structured as\nfollows. We begin in Section 1 by analyzing charts in terms of constructs\ncalled cells, which are a geometrical counterpart to rules. Then we move in\nSection 2 to a presentation of cancellation diagrams and show how they can be\nused computationally. In Section 3 we give a formal algebraic presentation of\nthe concept of group computation structure, which is based on the standard\nnotions of free group and conjugacy. We then relate in Section 4 the geometric\nand the algebraic views of computation by using the fundamental theorem of\ncombinatorial group theory (Rotman:1994). In Section 5 we study in more detail\nthe relationship between the two views on the basis of a simple grammar stated\nas a group computation structure. In section 6 we extend this grammar to handle\nnon-local constructs such as relative pronouns and quantifiers. We conclude in\nSection 7 with some brief notes on the differences between normal submonoids\nand normal subgroups, group computation versus rewriting systems, and the use\nof group morphisms to study the computational complexity of parsing and\ngeneration.",

Using this method we derive the conditions of\nvalidity of the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) and show how this approximate\ndescription relates to more general ones. We also show that the existence of\ndissipative coherent states is intimately related to the RWA.

    "summary": "Two-spinor formalism for Einstein Lagrangian is developed. The gravitational\nfield is regarded as a composite object derived from soldering forms. Our\nformalism is geometrically and globally well-defined and may be used in\nvirtually any 4m-dimensional manifold with arbitrary signature as well as\nwithout any stringent topological requirement on space-time, such as\nparallelizability. Interactions and feedbacks between gravity and spinor fields\nare considered. As is well known, the Hilbert-Einstein Lagrangian is second\norder also when expressed in terms of soldering forms. A covariant splitting is\nthen analysed leading to a first order Lagrangian which is recognized to play a\nfundamental role in the theory of conserved quantities. The splitting and\nthence the first order Lagrangian depend on a reference spin connection which\nis physically interpreted as setting the zero level for conserved quantities. A\ncomplete and detailed treatment of conserved quantities is then presented.",

Here, we test\nthe hypothesis that the appearance of small-world behavior is not a\nphase-transition but a crossover phenomenon which depends both on the network\nsize $n$ and on the degree of disorder $p$. We propose that the average\ndistance $\\ell$ between any two vertices of the network is a scaling function\nof $n / n^*$. The crossover size $n^*$ above which the network behaves as a\nsmall-world is shown to scale as $n^*(p \\ll 1) \\sim p^{-\\tau}$ with $\\tau\n\\approx 2/3$.",

Although users differ with respect to their knowledge of\nsystem limitations, and although different dialogue strategies make system\nlimitations more apparent to users, most current systems do not try to improve\nperformance by adapting dialogue behavior to individual users. This paper\npresents an empirical evaluation of TOOT, an adaptable spoken dialogue system\nfor retrieving train schedules on the web. We conduct an experiment in which 20\nusers carry out 4 tasks with both adaptable and non-adaptable versions of TOOT,\nresulting in a corpus of 80 dialogues. The values for a wide range of\nevaluation measures are then extracted from this corpus. Our results show that\nadaptable TOOT generally outperforms non-adaptable TOOT, and that the utility\nof adaptation depends on TOOT's initial dialogue strategies.",

One peaks in the IR - to soft X-ray band, radiating via\nthe synchrotron process; the other, peaking in the high-energy gamma-rays, is\nproduced by the Compton process. These spectra -- and, in particular, the \\asca\ndata -- suggest that the origin of the seed photons for Comptonization is\ndiverse. In the High-energy peaked BL Lac objects (HBLs), the dominant seed\nphotons for Comptonization appear to be the synchrotron photons internal to the\njet (SSC process). In the quasar-hosted blazars (QHBs), on the other hand, the\nX-ray band emission is still dominated by the SSC process, while the MeV to GeV\nrange is produced by Comptonization of external photons such as the emission\nline light. In the context of this three-component model, we derive the\nmagnetic field of 0.1 - 1 Gauss for all classes of blazars. Lorentz factors\ngamma_{peak} of electrons radiating at each peak of the nuFnu spectra are\nestimated to be ~10^{5}$ for HBLs; this is much higher than ~10^{3}$ for QHBs.\nThis difference is consistent with the fact that the four sources that are\nknown to emit TeV gamma-rays (TeV blazars) are all classified as HBLs. Among\nthe TeV blazars, Mkn 421 is one of the brightest and most variable emitters\nfrom ultraviolet (eV) to hard gamma-ray (TeV) energies.The multi-frequency\nobservations including TeV energy band provide the best opportunity to\nunderstand high-energy emission from blazar jets.

Comparing the source\npositions with those in the pulsar catalog, we got the first measurement of the\nproper motion upper limit of PSR B0031-07, which is $\\mu_{\\alpha}\\cos\\delta =\n-102 \\pm 74 mas/yr$ and $\\mu_{\\delta} = -105 \\pm 78 mas/yr$.",

To do this, we calculate the dissipative\ncoefficient explicitly from the equations of motion of the detector and the\nfield. This method gives not only the correct answer but also a hint as to the\norigin of the apparent statistics inversion effect. Moreover, this method is\ngeneralized to the Dirac field, by using the fermionic fluctuation-dissipation\ntheorem.

    "summary": "We rephrase the derivation of black hole radiation so as to take into\naccount, at the level of transition amplitudes, the change of the geometry\ninduced by the emission process. This enlarged description reveals that the\ndynamical variables which govern the emission are the horizon area and its\nconjugate time variable. Their conjugation is established through the boundary\nterm at the horizon which must be added to the canonical action of general\nrelativity in order to obtain a well defined action principle when the area\nvaries. These coordinates have already been used by Teitelboim and\ncollaborators to compute the partition function of a black hole. We use them to\nshow that the probability to emit a particle is given by $e^{- \\Delta A/4}$\nwhere $\\Delta A$ is the decrease in horizon area induced by the emission. This\nexpression improves Hawking result which is governed by a temperature (given by\nthe surface gravity) in that the specific heat of the black hole is no longer\nneglected. The present derivation of quantum black hole radiation is based on\nthe same principles which are used to derive the first law of classical black\nhole thermodynamics. Moreover it also applies to quantum processes associated\nwith cosmological or acceleration horizons. These two results indicate that not\nonly black holes but all event horizons possess an entropy which governs\nprocesses according to quantum statistical thermodynamics.",

Above 1 keV the spectrum is consistent with a\npower-law of photon index 1.47 +/- 0.10 and normalization 11.0 +/- 0.8 photon\ncm^-2 s^-1 keV^-1 sr^-1 at 1keV. The overall spectrum can be modeled by a\npower-law with 2 thermal components, or by a broken power-law and a single\nthermal component. In both cases the softer thermal emission dominates at less\nthan 0.3 keV and is seen through a column of a few 10^19 atom cm^-2. The other\ncomponents have columns consistent with the mean line of sight value. The metal\nabundances for the thermal components are poorly constrained, but consistent\nwith cosmic values. The power-law together with 2 thermal components model has\nbeen used to fit recent combined ASCA and ROSAT CXB measurements. Here, the\nsoft thermal component is interpreted as emission from the local hot bubble and\nthe hard thermal component as emission from a more distant absorbed region.\nWhile such a 2 component thermal model is consistent with the LECS spectrum, it\nis not required, and the hard thermal component may result from inadequate\nmodeling of the extragalactic contribution. The observed low-energy spectral\ncomplexity may therefore originate primarily in the local hot bubble. There is\nno evidence for the presence of a very soft CXB component with a temperature\n<0.1 keV. The emission measure seen by ROSAT is rejected at 90% confidence.",

The fields breaking the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry correspond\nto flat directions (flaton fields) and have unsuppressed couplings when PQ\nsymmetry is unbroken. The models have interesting particle physics\nphenomenology. The PQ scale is naturally generated through radiative\ncorrections; also, in the DFSZ case the $\\mu$ problem can be solved and\nneutrino masses can be generated. Cosmologically they lead to a short period of\nthermal inflation making the axion an excellent dark matter candidate if one of\nthe flaton fields has a positive effective mass-squared at early times but with\ntoo low a density in the opposite case.\n  A highly relativistic population of axions is produced by flaton decay during\nthe subsequent reheating, whose density is constrained by nucleosynthesis. We\nevaluate all of the relevant reaction rates and evaluate the nucleosynthesis\nconstraint. We find that the KSVZ model is practically ruled out, while the\nDFSZ model has a sizable allowed region of parameter space.",

In generic cases, $m_h$ is no longer\nbounded from below by these conditions. If we consider the $b \\to s \\gamma$\nconstraint, small values of $m_h$ are excluded in Model II of the 2HDM.",

We start\nwith the formulation of quantum field theory in terms of the Schwinger - Dyson\nequations for the correlation functions, which we describe by a\nclosed-time-path master ($n = \\infty PI$) effective action. When the hierarchy\nis truncated, one obtains the ordinary closed-system of correlation functions\nup to a certain order, and from the nPI effective action, a set of\ntime-reversal invariant equations of motion. But when the effect of the higher\norder correlation functions is included (through e.g., causal factorization--\nmolecular chaos -- conditions, which we call 'slaving'), in the form of a\ncorrelation noise, the dynamics of the lower order correlations shows\ndissipative features, as familiar in the field-theory version of Boltzmann\nequation. We show that fluctuation-dissipation relations exist for such\neffectively open systems, and use them to show that such a stochastic term,\nwhich explicitly introduces quantum fluctuations on the lower order correlation\nfunctions, necessarily accompanies the dissipative term, thus leading to a\nBoltzmann-Langevin equation which depicts both the dissipative and stochastic\ndynamics of correlation functions in quantum field theory.",

    "summary": "The gauge transformations of p-form fields in supergravity theories acquire a\nnon-commuting character when one introduces potentials both for the theory's\noriginal field strengths and for their duals. This has previously been shown in\nthe ``doubled'' formalism for maximal supergravities, where a generalised\nduality relation between original and dual field strengths replaces the\nequations of motion. In the doubled formalism, the gauge transformations\ngenerate a superalgebra, and the corresponding symmetries have accordingly been\ncalled ``superdualities.'' The corresponding Noether charges form a\nrepresentation of the cohomology ring on the spacetime manifold. In this paper,\nwe show that the gauge symmetry superalgebra implies certain non-trivial\nrelations among the various p-brane tensions, which can straightforwardly be\nread off from the superalgebra commutation relations. This provides an elegant\nderivation of the brane-tension relations purely within a given theory, without\nthe need to make use of duality relations between different theories, such as\nthe type IIA/IIB T-duality, although the results are consistent with such\ndualities. We present the complete set of brane-tension relations in M-theory,\nin the type IIA and type IIB theories, and in all the lower-dimensional maximal\nsupergravities. We also construct a doubled formalism for massive type IIA\nsupergravity, and this enables us to obtain the brane-tension relations\ninvolving the D8-brane, purely within the framework of the massive IIA theory.\nWe also obtain explicit transformations for the nine-dimensional T-duality\nbetween the massive type IIA theory and the Scherk-Schwarz reduced type IIB\ntheory.",

    "summary": "We have calculated the emergent X-ray properties for models of cluster\ncooling flows including the effects of accumulated cooled material. The opacity\nof this cooled gas can reduce the overall X-ray luminosity of the cooling flow,\nand values of Mdot based on these luminosities can underestimate the true value\nby factors of ~2. We find that accumulated cooled material can produce emergent\nsurface brightness profiles much like those observed even for nearly\nhomogeneous gas distributions. Consequently, much more of the gas may be\ncooling below X-ray emitting temperatures in the central regions of cooling\nflows (r < 10 kpc) than one would infer from observed X-ray surface brightness\nprofiles assuming the gas was optically thin. Similarly, the central densities\nand pressures in cooling flows may have been underestimated. We show that\ndistributed absorption in cooling flows produces a number of observable effects\nin the spectrum which may allow it to be differentiated from absorption due to\ngas in our Galaxy. These include a characteristic suppression of the continuum\nbelow ~2 keV, absorption features such as a redshifted O K-edge, and diminished\nintensity of resonance emission lines. Spectra including the effects of\nintrinsic absorption are not well fit by foreground absorbing models.\nAttempting to fit such models to the spatially resolved spectra can lead to\nunderestimates of the true absorbing column by factors of 3-20. Fits to\nintegrated spectra of the entire cooling flow region can either underestimate\nor overestimate the mass of the absorbing gas depending on the specifics of the\nmodel.

After\ndetailing the potential interest of nanostructures, I extensively study the\nfirst stages of growth (the submonolayer regime) by kinetic Monte-Carlo\nsimulations. These simulations are performed in a wide variety of experimental\nsituations : complete condensation, growth with reevaporation, nucleation on\ndefects, total or null cluster-cluster coalescence... The main scope of the\npaper is to help experimentalists analyzing their data to deduce which of those\nprocesses are important and to quantify them. A software including all these\nsimulation programs is available at no cost on request to the author. I\ncarefully discuss experiments of growth from cluster beams and show how the\nmobility of the clusters on the surface can be measured : surprisingly high\nvalues are found. An important issue for future technological applications of\ncluster deposition is the relation between the size of the incident clusters\nand the size of the islands obtained on the substrate. An approximate formula\nwhich gives the ratio of the two sizes as a function of the melting temperature\nof the material deposited is given. Finally, I study the atomic mechanisms\nwhich can explain the diffusion of the clusters on a substrate and the result\nof their mutual interaction (simple juxtaposition, partial or total\ncoalescence...)",

A\nvariable amount of Osipkov-Merritt (radial) orbital anisotropy is allowed in\nboth components. For these models, I derive analytically the necessary and\nsufficient conditions that the model parameters must satisfy in order to\ncorrespond to a physical system. Moreover, the possibility of adding a black\nhole at the center of radially anisotropic gamma models is discussed,\ndetermining analytically a lower limit of the anisotropy radius as a function\nof gamma. The analytical phase-space distribution function for (1,0) models is\npresented, together with the solution of the Jeans equations and the quantities\nentering the scalar virial theorem. It is proved that a globally isotropic\ngamma=1 component is consistent for any mass and core radius of the\nsuperimposed gamma=0 model; on the contrary, only a maximum value of the core\nradius is allowed for the gamma=0 model when a gamma=1 density distribution is\nadded. The combined effects of mass concentration and orbital anisotropy are\ninvestigated, and an interesting behavior of the distribution function of the\nanisotropic gamma=0 component is found: there exists a region in the parameter\nspace where a sufficient amount of anisotropy results in a consistent model,\nwhile the structurally identical but isotropic model would be inconsistent.",

The equivalent widths of all the lines\nanalyzed correlate extremely well with spectral types, implying that each of\nthem can be considered a good indicator of the spectral type in normal\ngalaxies. The position of most galaxies of our sample in classical emission\nline diagnostic diagrams follows that of individual giant HII regions in spiral\ngalaxies, but for the earliest type galaxies, the emission line pattern\nresembles more that of LINERs. Therefore, the direct interpretation of\nequivalent widths in terms of star formation rates would be misleading in such\ncases. The observed trends in the emission line ratios as a function of galaxy\nspectral type suggest a decrease of O/H, a decrease of N/O, an increase of the\naverage effective temperature or ionization parameter, and a decrease of the\neffective internal extinction of galaxies with increasing (early to late)\nspectral type.",

Previous X-ray observations of this object have shown\npersistent giant variability. The degree of variability at other wavelengths\nmay then be used to constrain the conditions and emission processes within the\nnucleus. Optical variability is expected if the electron population responsible\nfor the soft X-ray emission is changing rapidly and Compton-upscattering\ninfrared photons in the nucleus, or if the mechanism responsible for X-ray\nemission causes all the emission processes to vary together. We find that there\nis no significant optical variability with a firm upper limit of 2 per cent and\nconclude that the primary soft X-ray emission region produces little of the\nobserved optical emission. The X-ray and optical emission regions must be\nphysically distinct and any reprocessing of X-rays into the optical waveband\noccurs some distance from the nucleus. The lack of optical variability\nindicates that the energy density of infrared radiation in the nucleus is at\nmost equal to that of the ultraviolet radiation since little is upscattered\ninto the optical waveband. The extremely large X-ray variability of IRAS\n13224-3809 may be explained by relativistic boosting of more modest variations.\nAlthough such boosting enhances X-ray variability over optical variability,\nthis only partially explains the lack of optical variability.",

It is proved that BA function exists only\nfor very special configurations (locus configurations), which satisfy certain\noverdetermined algebraic system. The BA functions satisfy some algebraically\nintegrable Schrodinger equations, so any locus configuration determines such an\nequation. Some results towards the classification of all locus configurations\nare presented. This theory is applied to the famous Hadamard's problem of\ndescription of all hyperbolic equations satisfying Huygens' Principle.

This success cannot be attributed to a cancellation between\nCoulomb and Chern-Simons interactions beyond the mean field, because these\ninteractions have totally different energy scales. Rather, it results from the\nbehavior of the Coulomb pseudopotential V(L) (pair energy as a function of pair\nangular momentum) in the lowest Landau level (LL). The class of short range\nrepulsive pseudopotentials is defined that lead to short range Laughlin like\ncorrelations in many body systems and to which the CF model can be applied.\nThese Laughlin correlations are described quantitatively using the formalism of\nfractional parentage. The discussion is illustrated with an analysis of the\nenergy spectra obtained in numerical diagonalization of up to eleven electrons\nin the lowest and excited LL's. The qualitative difference in the behavior of\nV(L) is shown to sometimes invalidate the mean field CF picture when applied to\nhigher LL's. For example, the nu=7/3 state is not a Laughlin nu=1/3 state in\nthe first excited LL. The analysis of the involved pseudopotentials also\nexplains the success or failure of the CF picture when applied to other systems\nof charged Fermions with Coulomb repulsion, such as the Laughlin quasiparticles\nin the FQH hierarchy or charged excitons in an electron-hole plasma.",

The loose aggregates have a\nhierarchical structure in both space and time that resembles interstellar\nturbulence, suggesting that these stars form in only a few turbulent crossing\ntimes with positions that map out the previous gas distribution. Dense\nclusters, on the other hand, are often well mixed, as if self-gravitational\nmotion has erased the initial fine structure. Nevertheless, some of the\nyoungest dense clusters also show sub-clumping, so it may be that all stellar\nclustering is related to turbulence. Some of the densest clusters may also be\ntriggered. The evidence for mass segregation of the stars inside clusters is\nreviewed, along with various explanations for this effect. Other aspects of the\ntheory of cluster formation are reviewed as well, including many specific\nproposals for cluster formation mechanisms. The conditions for the formation of\nbound clusters are discussed. Critical star formation efficiencies can be as\nlow as 10% if the gas removal process is slow and the stars are born at\nsub-virial speeds. Environmental conditions, particularly pressure, may affect\nthe fraction and masses of clusters that end up bound. Globular clusters may\nform like normal open clusters but in conditions that prevailed during the\nformation of the halo and bulge, or in interacting and starburst galaxies\ntoday.

This allows us to\nshow how dephasing arises both in the particle-particle channel (weak\nlocalization) and in the particle-hole channel (interaction effect). First we\ndiscuss dephasing by an external field. Besides reviewing previous work on how\nan external oscillating field suppresses the weak localization correction, we\nderive a new expression for the effect of a field on the interaction\ncorrection. We find that the latter may be suppressed by a static electric\nfield, in contrast to weak localization. We then consider dephasing due to\ninelastic scattering. The ambiguities involved in the definition of the\ndephasing time are clarified by directly comparing the diagrammatic approach\nwith the path-integral approach. We show that different dephasing times appear\nin the particle-particle and particle-hole channels. Finally we comment on\nrecent experiments.",

It is morphologically best characterized as a discontinuity in u,\nu-y, with stars in the range 11,500<Teff(K)<20,000 deviating systematically\nfrom (in the sense of appearing brighter and/or hotter than) canonical ZAHBs.\nWe present u, y photometry of 14 GCs obtained with 3 different telescopes\n(Danish, NOT, HST) and demonstrate that the u-jump is present in every GC whose\nHB extends beyond 11,500K, irrespective of [Fe/H], mixing history on the RGB,\nand other GC parameters. We suggest that the u-jump is a ubiquitous feature,\nintrinsic to all HB stars hotter than 11,500K. We draw a parallel between the\nubiquitous nature of the u-jump and the problem of low measured gravities among\nBHB stars. We note that the \"logg-jump\" occurs over the same temperature range\nas the u-jump, and that it occurs in every metal-poor GC for which gravities\nhave been determined--irrespective of [Fe/H], mixing history on the RGB, or any\nother GC parameters. Furthermore, the u-jump and the logg-jump are connected on\na star-by-star basis. The two are likely different manifestations of the same\nphysical phenomenon. We present a framework which may simultaneously account\nfor the u-jump and the logg-jump. Reviewing spectroscopic data for several\nfield BHB stars, as well as two BHB stars in the GC NGC 6752, we find evidence\nthat radiative levitation of heavy elements takes place at Teff>11,500 K,\ndramatically enhancing their abundances in the atmospheres of BHB stars in the\n\"critical\" temperature region. Model atmospheres taking diffusion effects into\naccount are badly needed, and will likely lead to better overall agreement\nbetween canonical evolutionary theory and observations for BHB stars.",

    "summary": "We analyze the stability of the spontaneously dimerized spin-liquid phase of\nthe frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnet - the J1-J2 model. The lowest triplet\nexcitation, corresponding to breaking of a singlet bond, is found to be stable\nin the region 0.38 < J2/J1 < 0.62. In addition we find a stable low-energy\ncollective singlet mode, which is closely related to the spontaneous violation\nof the discrete symmetry. Both modes are gapped in the quantum disordered phase\nand become gapless at the transition point to the Neel ordered phase\n(J2/J1=0.38). The spontaneous dimerization vanishes at the transition and we\nargue that the disappearance of dimer order is related to the vanishing of the\nsinglet gap. We also present exact diagonalization data on a small (4x4)\ncluster which indeed show a structure of the spectrum, consistent with that of\na system with a four-fold degenerate (spontaneously dimerized) ground state.",

    "summary": "The event-by-event fluctuations of suitably chosen observables in heavy ion\ncollisions at SPS, RHIC and LHC can tell us about the thermodynamic properties\nof the hadronic system at freeze-out. By studying these fluctuations as a\nfunction of varying control parameters, it is possible to learn much about the\nphase diagram of QCD. As a timely example, we stress the methods by which\npresent experiments at the CERN SPS can locate the second-order critical\nendpoint of the first-order transition between quark-gluon plasma and hadron\nmatter. Those event-by-event signatures which are characteristic of freeze-out\nin the vicinity of the critical point will exhibit nonmonotonic dependence on\ncontrol parameters. We focus on observables constructed from the multiplicity\nand transverse momenta of charged pions. We first consider how the\nevent-by-event fluctuations of such observables are affected by Bose-Einstein\ncorrelations, by resonances which decay after freeze-out and by fluctuations in\nthe transverse flow velocity. We compare our thermodynamic predictions for such\nnoncritical event-by-event fluctuations with NA49 data, finding broad\nagreement. We then focus on effects due to thermal contact between the observed\npions and a heat bath with a given (possibly singular) specific heat, and due\nto the direct coupling between the critical fluctuations of the sigma field and\nthe observed pions. We also discuss the effect of the pions produced in the\ndecay of sigma particles just above threshold after freeze-out on the inclusive\npion spectrum and on multiplicity fluctuations. We estimate the size of these\nnonmonotonic effects which appear near the critical point, including\nrestrictions imposed by finite size and finite time, and conclude that they\nshould be easily observable.",

These sources represent a population of luminous dusty galaxies\nresponsible for the bulk of the 850-micron background detected by COBE and thus\nfor a substantial fraction of the total far-infrared emission in the Universe.\nWe present reliable redshifts for 20 galaxies and redshift limits for a further\n4 galaxies selected from the error-boxes of 14 submm sources. Two other submm\ndetections in the sample have no obvious optical counterparts, and the final\nsubmm source was only identified from imaging data after the completion of our\nspectroscopic observations. The optical identifications for 4 of the submm\nsources have been confirmed through either their detection in CO at\nmm-wavelengths (two pairs of galaxies at z=2.55 and z=2.80) or from the\ncharacteristics of their spectral energy distributions (two of the central cD\ngalaxies in the lensing clusters). Plausible arguments based on the optical\nspectral properties (starburst or AGN signatures) of the counterparts allow us\nto identify a further two likely counterparts at z=1.06 and 1.16. For the\nremaining 8 cases, it is not always clear which, if any, of the optical sources\nidentified are the true counterparts. Possible counterparts for these have\nredshifts ranging from z=0.18 to z=2.11. Working with the current\nidentifications, we suggest that the majority of the extragalactic background\nlight in the submm is emitted by sources at z<3 and hence that the peak\nactivity in highly-obscured sources (both AGN and starbursts) lies at\nrelatively modest redshifts.

We focus on the\nearly-time behavior of the radius $\\rmn$ of the small bridge between the two\ndrops. The flow is driven by a highly curved meniscus of length $2\\pi \\rmn$ and\nwidth $\\Delta\\ll\\rmn$ around the bridge, from which we conclude that the\nleading-order problem is asymptotically equivalent to its two-dimensional\ncounterpart. An exact two-dimensional solution for the case of inviscid\nsurroundings [Hopper, J. Fluid Mech. ${\\bf 213}$, 349 (1990)] shows that\n$\\Delta \\propto \\rmn^3$ and $\\rmn \\sim (t\\gamma/\\pi\\eta)\\ln [t\\gamma/(\\eta\nR)]$; and thus the same is true in three dimensions. The case of coalescence\nwith an external viscous fluid is also studied in detail both analytically and\nnumerically. A significantly different structure is found in which the outer\nfluid forms a toroidal bubble of radius $\\Delta \\propto \\rmn^{3/2}$ at the\nmeniscus and $\\rmn \\sim (t\\gamma/4\\pi\\eta) \\ln [t\\gamma/(\\eta R)]$. This basic\ndifference is due to the presence of the outer fluid viscosity, however small.\nWith lengths scaled by $R$ a full description of the asymptotic flow for\n$\\rmn(t)\\ll1$ involves matching of lengthscales of order $\\rmn^2, \\rmn^{3/2}$,\n\\rmn$, 1 and probably $\\rmn^{7/4}$.",

The question of\nstability of this beautiful and universal result against certain perturbations\nof the repulsive and convex interactions seems to be interesting by itself.\nAdditional motivations for studying such perturbations come from surface\nphysics (adsorbtion on crystal surfaces) and theories of correlated fermion\nsystems (recent results on ground-state particle configurations of the\none-dimensional spinless Falicov-Kimball model).\n  As a first step we have studied a one-dimensional lattice gas whose two-body\ninteractions are repulsive and strictly convex only from distance 2 on while\nits value at distance 1 is fixed near its value at infinity. We show that such\na modification makes the ground-state particle configurations sensitive to the\ndecay rate of the interactions: if it is fast enough, then particles form\n2-particle lattice-connected aggregates that are distributed in the most\nhomogeneous way.

Within $20 R_J$ from Jupiter (Jupiter radius, $R_J = 71,492\nkm$) class 2 shows clear indications for contamination by noise. We analyse the\ndust data from Galileo's prime Jupiter mission (1996 and 1997), separate dust\nimpacts from noise events and derive a complete denoised set of Galileo dust\ndata (class 2 and class 3). Collimated streams of nanometer-sized dust\nparticles which have been detected throughout the Jovian system (Gr\\\"un et al.\n1998, JGR, 103, 20011-20022) are used to analyse the sensitive area and the\nfield of view of the dust detector itself. The sensitive area for stream\nparticles which trigger class 3 events is $110 \\pm 37 cm^2$. This is almost a\nfactor of ten smaller than the total sensitive area for class 2 impacts (1,000\ncm^2). Correspondingly, the field of view of the detector for class 3 stream\nparticles is reduced from $140^{\\circ}$ to $96^{\\circ}$. The magnetometer boom\nand other instruments on board Galileo cause a significant shadowing of the\nfield of view of the dust sensor. Our analysis is supplementary to ground\ncalibrations of the dust instrument because the low masses and high speeds of\nthe stream particles could not be achieved in the laboratory.

    "summary": "This paper discusses the symmetry of the wave field that lies to the right\nand left of a two-sided accelerated mirror in 1 + 1 space and satisfies a\nsingle condition on it. The symmetry is accumulated in the Bogolyubov matrix\ncoefficients $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ that connect the two complete sets of\nsolutions of the wave equations. The amplitudes of the quantum processes in the\nright and left half-spaces are expressed in terms of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ and\nare related to each other by transformation (12). Coefficient\n$\\beta_{\\omega'\\omega}^*$ plays the role of the source amplitude of a pair of\nparticles that are directed to opposite sides with frequencies $\\omega$ and\n$\\omega'$ but that are in either the left or the right half-space as a\nconsequence of the reflection of one of them. Such an interpretation makes\n$\\beta_{\\omega'\\omega}^*$ observable and explains the equalities, given by Eq.\n(1) and found earlier by Nikishov and author [Zh. Eksp. Teor. Fiz. 108, 1121\n(1995)] and by author [Zh. Eksp. Teor. Fiz. 110, 526 (1996)] that the radiation\nspectra of a mirror in 1+1 space coincide with those of charges in 3 + 1 space\nby the fact that the moment of the pair emitted by the mirror coincide with the\nspin of the single particle emitted by the charge.",

Different scenarios with\nthree and four neutrinos are worked out in detail including matter effects in\nlong baseline experiments and it is shown that in some cases CP-violating\neffects could affect the analysis of a possible measurement. In particular in\nthe three neutrino case we find that the effects can be larger than expected,\nat least in long-baseline $\\nu_\\mu\\to\\nu_e$. Moreover, measuring these effects\ncould give useful information on the solar oscillation frequency. In four\nneutrino scenarios large effects are possible both in the $\\nu_\\mu\\to\\nu_\\tau$\nand $\\nu_\\mu\\to\\nu_e$ channels of long-baseline experiments, whereas\nshort-baseline experiments are affected only marginally.",

The QPO had a frequency between 0.58 and\n2.44 Hz changing on time scales of a few days, an rms amplitude between 8% and\n12%, and was detected in the persistent emission, during dips and during type I\nX-ray bursts. During one observation, when the count rate was a factor 2 to 3\nhigher than otherwise, the QPO was not detected. The strength of the QPO did\nnot significantly depend on photon energy, and is consistent with being the\nsame in the persistent emission, both during and outside the dips, and during\ntype I X-ray bursts. Frequency shifts were observed during three of the four\nX-ray bursts. We argue that the QPO is produced by the same mechanism as the\nQPO recently found by Jonker et al. (1999) in 4U 1323-62. Although the exact\nmechanism is not clear, it is most likely related to the high inclination of\nboth systems.

The agreement between mid-infrared and optical classification is\nexcellent if optical LINER spectra are assigned to the starburst group. The\nstarburst nature of ULIRG LINERs strongly supports the suggestion that LINER\nspectra in infrared-selected galaxies, rather than being an expression of the\nAGN phenomenon, are due to shocks that are probably related to galactic\nsuperwinds. Differences between ISO and optical classification provide clues on\nthe evolution of ULIRGs and on the configuration of obscuring dust. We find few\nISO AGN with optical HII or LINER identification, suggesting that highly\nobscured AGN exist but are not typical for the ULIRG phenomenon in general.\nRather, our results indicate that strong AGN activity, once triggered, quickly\nbreaks the obscuring screen at least in certain directions, thus becoming\ndetectable over a wide wavelength range.",

In particular, the\nl-V traces of the prominent offset dustlanes leading the bar major axis in\nearly-type barred spirals can be unambiguously identified, and the 3-kpc arm\nand its non-symmetric galactocentric opposite counterarm are the inner\nprolongations of disc spiral arms passing round the bar and joining the\ndustlanes at very different galactocentric distances.

There is a model for which the average case lower bound rises\nto $\\Omega(n^2 \\log n)$ and another model where the average case upper bound\ndrops to $O(n \\log^2 n)$.

In the case of a weak magnetic field, the effective kinetic\noperator corresponds to diffusion in the angle space, the diffusion constant\nbeing determined by the spectral resolution of the inhomogeneous magnetic\nfield. Applying these results to the quantum problem, we demonstrate that the\nlow-lying modes of the field theory are related to the eigenmodes of the\nirreversible classical dynamics, and the higher modes are separated from the\nzero mode by a gap associated with the lowest density relaxation rate.

To any principal nilpotent pair we associate a\ntwo-parameter analogue of the Kostant partition function, and propose the\ncorresponding two-parameter analogue of the weight multiplicity formula.\n  In a different direction, each principal nilpotent pair gives rise to a\nharmonic polynomial on the Cartesian square of the Cartan subalgebra, that\ntransforms under an irreducible representation of the Weyl group. In the\nspecial case of sl_n, the conjugacy classes of principal nilpotent pairs and\nthe irreducible representations of the Symmetric group, S_n, are both\nparametrised (in a compatible way) by Young diagrams.

In other astrophysical contexts where we have\nbeen able to observe the actual particle energy distributions, e.g. solar\nsystem plasmas, and in many particle acceleration theories, the heating\nmechanism supplies only some fraction of the available energy to very energetic\nparticles.

We\ncan now detect the spectra of nearby TeV blazars like Mrk 421 and 501 out to\napproximately 20 TeV, and during the strongest flares, we can now follow\nfluctuations in these spectra on timescales close to the shortest ones likely\nin these objects. We point out that this represents a unique opportunity. Using\nthese and future detectors in combination with broadband X-ray satellites like\nSAX and RXTE, we will be able to simultaneously follow all significant\nX-ray/gamma-ray variations in a blazar's emission. This will provide the most\nstringent test yet of the synchrotron-Compton emission model for these objects.\nIn preparation for the data to come, we present sample SSC model calculations\nusing a fully self-consistent, accurate code to illustrate the variability\nbehavior one might see (the range of behavior is wider than many expect) and to\nshow how good timing information can probe physical conditions in the source.\nIf the model works, i.e., if X-ray/TeV variations are consistent with being\nproduced by a common electron distribution, then we show it is possible to\nrobustly estimate the blazar's intrinsic TeV spectrum from its X-ray spectrum.\nKnowing this spectrum, we can then determine the level of absorption in the\nobserved spectrum. Constraining this absorption, due to gamma-ray pair\nproduction on diffuse radiation, provides an important constraint on the\ninfrared extragalactic background intensity. Without the intrinsic spectrum, we\nshow that detecting absorption is very difficult and argue that Mrk 421 and\n501, as close as they are, may already be absorbed by a factor 2 at\napproximately 3 TeV.

If the\nsynchrotron-Compton emission model turns out to work, then we know that the\nsame electrons are responsible for both the X-ray and the gamma-ray emission of\nthese objects. In this case, we show that we can use their observed X-ray\nspectra to robustly estimate their intrinsic gamma-ray spectra. Among blazars,\nMrk 421/501 are particularly well-suited for this task because the Compton\nscattering which produces their TeV gamma-rays is likely to be in the\nKlein-Nishina limit, where the outgoing photon has an energy insensitive to the\nincoming photon energy. With a better handle on their intrinsic TeV spectra, we\ncan then begin to search for evidence of absorption due to gamma-ray pair\nproduction on diffuse infrared background radiation. We discuss some of the\npitfalls that arise when one attempts to do this without knowing the intrinsic\nspectrum. Although Mrk 421/501 are very nearby, the emission of these sources\nextends to sufficiently high energies (> 20 TeV in Mrk 501) that we may\nnevertheless be able to derive interesting constraints on the infrared\nbackground. If correct, the combination of the COBE 140 micron detection and\nthe measurement of Mrk 501's spectrum out to 20 TeV and perhaps beyond rules\nout conventional galaxy evolution and star formation scenarios, implying that\nmuch of the star formation in the Universe indeed occurs at early times in\nhighly obscured sources that have been missed until now.",

Using renormalization group invariance, theories with several\nindependent couplings are related to a set of theories with a single coupling\nparameter. The reduced theories may have particular symmetries, or they may not\nbe related to any known symmetry. The method is more general than the\nimposition of invariance properties. Usually, there are only a few reduced\ntheories with an asymptotic power series expansion corresponding to a\nrenormalizable Lagrangian. There also exist `general' solutions containing\nnon-integer powers and sometimes logarithmic factors. As an example for the use\nof the reduction method, the dual magnetic theories associated with certain\nsupersymmetric gauge theories are discussed. They have a superpotential with a\nYukawa coupling parameter. This parameter is expressed as a function of the\ngauge coupling. Given some standard conditions, a unique, isolated power series\nsolution of the reduction equations is obtained. After reparametrization, the\nYukawa coupling is proportional to the square of the gauge coupling parameter.\nThe coefficient is given explicitly in terms of the numbers of colors and\nflavors. `General' solutions with non-integer powers are also discussed.

We perform numerical simulations of the formation\nof dark matter halos, each containing \\gsim 10^6 particles and resolved to\n0.003 times the virial radius, allowing an accurate comparison with rotation\ncurve data. A good fit to both galactic and cluster sized halos can be achieved\nusing the density profile rho(r) \\propto [(r/r_s)^1.5(1+(r/r_s)^1.5)]^-1, where\nr_s is a scale radius. This profile has a steeper asymptotic slope, rho(r)\n\\propto r^-1.5, and a sharper turnover than found by lower resolution studies.\nThe central structure of relaxed halos that form within a hierarchical universe\nhas a remarkably small scatter (unrelaxed halos would not host disks). We\ncompare the results with a sample of dark matter dominated, low surface\nbrightness (LSB) galaxies with circular velocities in the range 100-300 km/s.\nThe rotation curves of disks within cold dark matter halos rise too steeply to\nmatch these data which require a constant mass density in the central regions.\nThe same conclusion is reached if we compare the scale free shape of observed\nrotation curves with the simulation data. It is important to confirm these\nresults using stellar rather than HI rotation curves for LSB galaxies. We test\nthe effects of introducing a cut-off in the power spectrum that may occur in a\nuniverse dominated by warm dark matter.

To\nshow these effects, we perform a hydrodynamic cosmological simulation and\nexamine the density field of recently formed galaxies as a function of\nredshift. We find the bias b_* of recently formed galaxies (the ratio of the\nrms fluctuations of these galaxies and mass), evolves from 4.5 at z=3 to around\n1 at z=0, on 8 h^{-1} Mpc comoving scales. The correlation coefficient r_*\nbetween recently formed galaxies and mass evolves from 0.9 at z=3 to 0.25 at\nz=0. As gas in the universe heats up and prevents star formation, star-forming\ngalaxies become poorer tracers of the mass density field. After galaxies form,\nthe linear continuity equation is a good approximation to the gravitational\ndebiasing, even on nonlinear scales. The most interesting observational\nconsequence of the simulations is that the linear regression of the\nstar-formation density field on the galaxy density field evolves from about 0.9\nat z=1 to 0.35 at z=0. These effects also provide a possible explanation for\nthe Butcher-Oemler effect, the excess of blue galaxies in clusters at redshift\nz ~ 0.5. Finally, we examine cluster mass-to-light ratio estimates of Omega,\nfinding that while Omega(z) increases with z, one's estimate Omega_est(z)\ndecreases. (Abridged)",

    "summary": "There is a growing number of observational indicators for the presence of\nbipolar outflows in massive, young stellar objects that are still accreting\nmass as part of their formation process. In particular, there is evidence that\nthe outflows from these objects can attain higher velocities and kinetic\nluminosities than their lower-mass counterparts. Furthermore, the higher-mass\nobjects appear to smoothly continue the correlation found in T Tauri stars\nbetween outflow and accretion signatures, and in several cases there are direct\nclues to the existence of a circumstellar disk from optical and infrared\nimaging and spectroscopy as well as from millimeter-wavelength interferometry.\nThese results suggest that the disk-outflow connection found in low-mass\npre-main-sequence stars extends to more massive objects, and that a similar\nphysical mechanism may drive the outflows in both cases. I examine the\nobservational basis for this hypothesis and consider how the commonly invoked\ncentrifugally driven wind models of bipolar outflows in low-mass stars would be\naffected by the various physical processes (such as photoionization,\nphotoevaporation, radiation pressure, and stellar wind ram pressure) that\noperate in higher-mass stars. I then list some of the interesting questions\nthat one could hope to address as this young field of research continues to\ndevelop.",

The algorithm is based on the iterative Richardson-Lucy scheme to\nwhich we added a wavelet thresholding step in order to eliminate image-noise in\nthe reconstruction. The wavelet thresholding explicitly accounts for spatial\ncorrelations in the data, and adapts the angular resolution locally, depending\non the significance of the signal in the data.\n  We compare the performance of MREM to that of the maximum entropy and the\nRichardson-Lucy algorithms by means of Monte-Carlo simulations of COMPTEL 1.809\nMeV gamma-ray line observations. The simulations demonstrate that the maximum\nentropy and Richardson-Lucy algorithms provide virtually identical\nreconstructions which are heavily disturbed by image noise. MREM largely\nsuppresses this noise in the reconstructions, showing only the significant\nstructures that are present in the data.\n  Application of MREM to COMPTEL 1.8 MeV gamma-ray line data results in a 1.809\nMeV sky map that is much smoother than the maximum entropy or Richardson-Lucy\nreconstructions presented previously. The essential features of this map are\n(1) an asymmetric galactic ridge emission reaching from l=45 deg to l=240 deg,\n  (2) a bright localised emission feature in the Cygnus region around (l,b)=(80\ndeg,0 deg),\n  (3) two emission spots at l=317 deg and l=332 deg situated in the galactic\nplane, and (4) an extended emission region around (l,b)=(160 deg, 0 deg).\nComparison of the MREM map to the simulated reconstructions demonstrates that\nthe 1.809 MeV emission is confined to the galactic plane.",

The\nquasi-stationary, filamentary structure of the cold gas is remarkable. The hot\ngas, characterized by low-density holes and voids, is produced by shock\nheating. The shocks derive their energy from differential rotation and\ngravitational perturbations due to the formation of cold dense clumps. In the\nquasi-stable phase where cold and dense clouds are formed, the effective\nstability parameter, Q, has a value in the range 2-5.

An extended double-exchange model\ncontaining Coulomb interaction, doubly degenerate orbitals and Jahn-Teller\ncoupling is derived under full polarization of spins with two-dimensional\nanisotropy. Quantum fluctuation effects of Coulomb interaction and orbital\ndegrees of freedom are investigated by using the quantum Monte Carlo method. In\nundoped states, it is crucial to consider both the Coulomb interaction and the\nJahn-Teller coupling in reproducing characteristic hierarchy of energy scales\namong charge, orbital-lattice and spin degrees of freedom in experiments. Our\nnumerical results quantitatively reproduce the charge gap amplitude as well as\nthe stabilization energy and the amplitude of the cooperative Jahn-Teller\ndistortion in undoped compounds. Upon doping of carriers, in the absence of the\nJahn-Teller distortion, critical enhancement of both charge compressibility and\norbital correlation length is found with decreasing doping concentration. These\nare discussed as origins of strong incoherence in charge dynamics. With the\nJahn-Teller coupling in the doped region, collapse of the Jahn-Teller\ndistortion and instability to phase separation are obtained and favorably\ncompared with experiments.

We have found that there is little differences\nbetween the results in two and three dimensions about the dynamics of\nfluctuations, at least, during preheating. Practically, it is difficult to\ndetermine whether long cosmic strings which may affect the later evolution of\nthe universe could ever be produced from the results of simulations on\nthree-dimensional lattices with smaller box sizes than the horizon. Therefore,\nusing two-dimensional lattices with large box size, we have found that cosmic\nstrings with the breaking scale 0\\eta \\sim 10^{16} GeV are produced for broad\nrange of parameter space in \\eta, while for higher breaking scales (\\eta \\sim\n3\\times 10^{16} GeV), their production depends crucially on the value of the\nbreaking scale \\eta in our simulations.",

Identifying two independent - weak and strong -\nuniversality groups and assuming that the grand unification group is SU(8N),\nits subgroup respecting either weak or strong universality is shown to be G =\nSU(2)xU(1)xSU(3). The fundamental representation of SU(8N) decomposes as N\nfamilies of leptons and quarks. In the G-invariant limit, all fermions are\nleft-handed. A mechanism for generating the correct number of right-handed\nfermions with the correct couplings so as to give pure vector colour and\nelectromagnetic currents is exhibited.

We present in\nthis paper an indicator of the accuracy of the separation of the CMB\nanisotropies from those induced by foregrounds. Of course, the outcome will\ndepend on the spectral and spatial characteristics of the sources of\nanisotropies. We thus start by summarising present knowledge on the spectral\nand spatial properties of Galactic foregrounds, point sources, and clusters of\ngalaxies. This information comes in support of a modelling of the microwave sky\nincluding the relevant components. The accuracy indicator we introduce is based\non a generalisation of the Wiener filtering method to multi-frequency,\nmulti-resolution data. While the development and use of this indicator was\nprompted by the preparation of the scientific case for the \\plancks satellite,\nit has broader application since it allows assessing the effective capabilities\nof an instrumental set-up once foregrounds are fully accounted for, with a view\nto enabling comparisons between different experimental arrangements. The real\nsky might well be different from the one assumed here, and the analysis method\nmight not be in the end Wiener filtering, but this work still allow meaningful\n{\\em comparative} studies. As a matter of examples, we compare the CMB\nreconstruction errors for the \\maps and \\plancks space missions, as well as the\nrobustness of the \\plancks outcome to possible failures of specific spectral\nchannels or global variations of the detectors noise level across spectral\nchannels.",

    "summary": "Current theories of galaxy formation predict that spiral galaxies are\nembedded in a reservoir of hot gas. This gas is able to cool onto the galaxy\nreplenishing cold gas that is consumed by star formation. Estimates of the\nX-ray luminosity emitted in the cooling region suggest a bolometric luminosity\nof order 10 x 10^41 ergs/s in massive systems. We have used ROSAT PSPC data to\nsearch for extended X-ray emission from the haloes of three nearby, massive,\nlate-type galaxies: NGC 2841, NGC 4594 and NGC 5529. We infer 95 per cent upper\nlimits on the bolometric X-ray luminosities of the haloes of NGC 2841, NGC 4594\nand NGC 5529 of 0.4, 1.2 and 3.8 x 10^41 ergs/s respectively. Thus the true\nluminosity lies well below the straightforward theoretical prediction. We\ndiscuss this discrepancy and suggest a number of ways in which the theoretical\nmodel can be brought into agreement with the observational results. A possible\nsolution is that the gravitational potentials of the dark matter haloes of\nthese galaxies are weaker than assumed in the current model. Alternatively, the\npresent day accretion may be substantially less than is required on average to\nbuild the disk over the Hubble time. Our results are, however, based on only\nthree galaxies, none of which is ideal for this kind of study. A larger data\nset is required to explore this important problem further.",

Two days of observations were conducted at the Palomar Observatory\nduring the nights of 25 and 26 February 1997 with the 5-meter Hale telescope,\nin order to search for rapid variability in the near-infrared (NIR) bands J, H,\nKs for a selection of eight blazars. With the possible exception of 1156+295\n(4C 29.45), no intraday or day-to-day variability was observed during these two\nnights. However, for these eight blazars, we have measured the NIR luminosities\nand spectral indices. It has recently been reported that the gamma-ray emission\nis better correlated with the near-infrared luminosity than with the X-ray\nluminosity. This correlation is suggested as a general property of blazars\nbecause hot dust is the main source of soft photons which are scattered off the\nrelativistic jets of electrons to produce the gamma rays by inverse Compton\nscattering. We thus used this relationship to estimate the gamma-ray\nluminosity.",

The extragalactic far-infrared\nand submillimetre backgrounds have also been detected, providing further\nconstraints on the history of star formation. In this paper we estimate the\nfraction of these backgrounds and source counts which could be explained by\nAGN. The relative fractions of obscured and unobscured objects are constrained\nby the requirement that they fit the spectrum of the cosmic X-ray background.\nOn the assumption that the spectral energy distributions of high redshift AGN\nare similar to those observed locally, we find that one can explain at least\n10-20 per cent of the 850 micron SCUBA sources at 1mJy and a similar fraction\nof the far-infrared/submillimetre background. The exact contribution depends on\nthe assumed cosmology and the space density of AGN at high redshift (z>3), but\nwe conclude that active nuclei will be present in a significant (though not\ndominant) fraction of the faint SCUBA sources. This fraction could be\nsignificantly higher if a large population of AGN are highly obscured\n(Compton-thick) at X-ray wavelengths.",

As a consequence of these two scales, the density C_k(t) of domains of\nlength k does not obey scaling. This breakdown of scaling also leads to the\ndensity of short domains decaying as t^{-5/4}, instead of the t^{-3/2} decay\nthat would arise from pure domain diffusion.",

There appears to be no systematic difference\nin dark matter content between barred and unbarred galaxies, consistent with\nthe theoretical result that the global stability of galaxies with dense centers\ndoes not depend on their halo fraction. The rotation curve shapes of lower\nluminosity and low-surface-brightness galaxies, on the other hand, indicate\nsignificant mass in the DM halo even near their centers. We find that most DM\nhalos appear to have large cores, inconsistent with the predictions from\ncosmological simulations. We also show that such large-core halos can result\nfrom compression by disk infall of physically reasonable initial halos.

The analysis naturally reveals two\ntypes of configurations: the ``marginal'' and the ``non-marginal'' ones. We\nspecify possible configurations for a pair of similar or non-similar branes in\neither of these two categories. In particular, for two similar branes at\nangles, this analysis reveals that all the marginal configurations are\nspecified by SU(2) angles while the non-marginal configurations are specified\nby $Sp(2)$ angles. On the other hand, we find that no other configuration of\ntwo intersecting branes at non-trivial angles can be constructed out of flat\np-branes. So in particular, two non-similar branes can only be found in an\northogonal configuration. In this case the intersection rules for either of the\nmarginal or non-marginal configurations are derived, which thereby provide\ninterpretations for the known results from supergravity.",

(2) I then briefly discuss interactions between disturbances in\nthe discs of galaxies and the spherical components, which generally exert a\ndamping effect through dynamical friction. The fact that bars in real galaxies\nappear to rotate quite rapidly, seems to require dark matter halos to have\nlarge, low-density cores. (3) In the remainder of the article, I consider the\ntheory of spiral structure. The new development here is that the distribution\nfunction for stars in the Solar neighbourhood, as measured by HIPPARCOS, is far\nless smooth than most theoretical work had previously supposed. The strong\nvariations in the values of the \\DF over small ranges in angular momentum have\nthe appearance of having been caused by scattering at Lindblad resonances with\nspiral patterns. This result, if confirmed when the radial velocity data become\navailable, supports the picture of spiral patterns as dynamical instabilities\ndriven by substructure in the \\DF. The details of how decaying patterns might\nseed conditions for a new instability remain unclear, and deserve fresh\nattention.",

In the case of itinerant ferromagnets, the critical\nbehavior is unaffected by the rare regions due to an effective long-range\ninteraction between the order parameter fluctuations.",

The fact that this emission (the afterglow) extends at longer\nwavelengths, has led to the discovery of the first optical/IR/radio\ncounterparts in 1997-98, greatly improving our understanding of these sources.\nNow it is widely accepted that GRBs originate at cosmological distances but\nwhile the observed afterglow satisfies the predictions of the relativistic\nfireball models, the central engines that power these extraordinary events\nremain still unknown.

The so-called \"blue\" blazars, whose first\nSED component peaks at X-ray energies, are TeV sources, although with a\nrelatively small fraction of their bolometric luminosities. The \"red\" blazars,\nwith SED peaks in the infrared-optical range, appear to emit relatively more\npower in the gamma-ray component but at much lower energies (GeV and below).\nCorrelated variations across the SEDs (of both types) are consistent with the\npicture that a single electron population gives rise to the high-energy parts\nof both SED components, via synchrotron at low energies and Compton-scattering\nat high energies. In this scenario, the trends of SED shape with luminosity can\nbe explained by electron cooling on ambient photons. With simple assumptions,\nwe can make some estimates of the physical conditions in blazar jets of each\n\"type\" and can predict which blazars are the most likely TeV sources. Upper\nlimits from a mini-survey of candidate TeV sources indicate that only ~10% of\ntheir bolometric luminosity is radiated in gamma-rays, assuming the two SED\ncomponents peak near 1 keV and 1 TeV. Finally, present blazar samples are too\nshallow to indicate what kinds of jets nature prefers, i.e., whether the\nlow-luminosity \"blue\" blazars or the high-luminosity \"red\" blazars are more\ncommon.",

The partition function of\nU(n), N=4 Super-Yang-Mills theory on $T^4$, with generic SO(6) R-symmetry\ntwists, for example, is derived from the $n^{th}$ coefficient of the Fourier\ntransform of the function with respect to appropriate periodic variables,\nsetting other variables to the R-symmetry twists and the radii of $T^4$. In\nparticular, the partition function of nonsupersymmetric Yang-Mills theory is a\nspecial case, obtained from the twisted $(2,0)$ or little-string theories. The\nfunction also seems to encode the answer to questions about M-theory on an\narbitrary $T^8$.

We\nidentify cuts to enhance the signal above Standard Model backgrounds, and use\nISAJET to evaluate the SUSY reach of experiments at the Fermilab Main Injector\nand at the proposed TeV33. For the model lines that we have examined, we find\nthat the reach is at least as large, and frequently larger, than in the mSUGRA\nframework. For two of these model lines, we find that the ability to identify\n$b$-quarks and $\\tau$-leptons with high efficiency and purity is essential for\nthe detection of the signal.",

Among\nthe models that have been proposed to explain the properties of AXPs, the most\nlikely ones are: (1) isolated accreting neutron stars evolved from the\nThorne-\\.{Z}ytkow objects due to complete spiral-in during the common envelope\nevolution of high-mass X-ray binaries, and (2) magnetars, which are neutron\nstars with ultra-high ($\\sim 10^{14}-10^{15}$ G) surface magnetic fields. We\nhave critically examined the predicted change of neutron star's spin in the\naccretion model, and found that it is unable to account for the steady\nspin-down observed in AXPs. A simple analysis also shows that any accretion\ndisk around an isolated neutron star has extremely limited lifetime. A more\npromising explanation for such objects is the magnetar model.",

The bolometric luminosity of\n10$^{10}$ Lsol of these starbursts is similar to the estimated bolometric\nluminosities of their obscured Seyfert 1 nuclei, and thus they contribute in\nthe same amount to the overall energetics of these galaxies. An extended work\nbased on ground-based optical spectra of the 20 brightest nuclei known indicate\nthat at least 40% of the Seyfert 2 galaxies harbor a nuclear starburst. The\neight Seyfert 2 nuclei that harbor a starburst are strong IR emitters.

In the latter state, the systems switch\nbetween the formerly disjoint attractors due to the inherent chaotic dynamics.\nThis switching rate is found to ``resonate'' with the frequency of an\nexternally applied periodic perturbation (either parametric or additive). The\nexistence of a resonance in the response of the system is characterized in\nterms of the residence-time distributions. The results are an unambiguous\nindicator of the presence of SR-like behavior in these systems. Analytical\ninvestigations supporting the observations are also presented. The results have\nimplications in the area of information processing in biological systems.",

    "summary": "Seshadri constants are local invariants, introduced by Demailly, which\nmeasure the local positivity of ample line bundles. Recent interest in Seshadri\nconstants stems on the one hand from the fact that bounds on Seshadri constants\nyield, via vanishing theorems, bounds on the number of points and jets that\nadjoint linear series separate. On the other hand it has become increasingly\nclear by now that Seshadri constants are highly interesting invariants quite in\ntheir own right. Except in the simplest cases, however, they are already in the\ncase of surfaces very hard to control or to compute explicitly---hardly any\nexplicit values of Seshadri constants are known so far. The purpose of the\npresent paper is to study these invariants on algebraic surfaces. On the one\nhand, we prove a number of explicit bounds for Seshadri constants and Seshadri\nsubmaximal curves, and on the other hand, we give complete results for abelian\nsurfaces of Picard number one. A nice feature of this result is that it allows\nto explicitly compute the Seshadri constants---as well as the unique\nirreducible curve that accounts for it---for a whole class of surfaces. It also\nshows that Seshadri constants have an intriguing number-theoretic flavor in\nthis case.",

In this goal, we introduce a\nnon-linear transformation that maps the returns onto gaussian variables whose\ncovariance matrix provides a new measure of dependence between the non-normal\nreturns, generalizing the covariance matrix into a non-linear fractional\ncovariance matrix. This nonlinear covariance matrix is chiseled to the specific\nfat tail structure of the underlying marginal distributions, thus ensuring\nstability and good-conditionning. The portfolio distribution is obtained as the\nsolution of a mapping to a so-called phi-q field theory in particle physics, of\nwhich we offer an extensive treatment using Feynman diagrammatic techniques and\nlarge deviation theory, that we illustrate in details for multivariate Weibull\ndistributions. The main result of our theory is that minimizing the portfolio\nvariance (i.e. the relatively ``small'' risks) may often increase the large\nrisks, as measured by higher normalized cumulants. Extensive empirical tests\nare presented on the foreign exchange market that validate satisfactorily the\ntheory. For ``fat tail'' distributions, we show that an adequete prediction of\nthe risks of a portfolio relies much more on the correct description of the\ntail structure rather than on their correlations.",

In this paper new methods of\nconstruction of algebraic quotients of open G-invariant subsets of W are\nstudied. This is done by associating to W a new space of morphisms\nW'=Hom(E',F') (with group G'=Aut(E')XAut(F')) in such a way that there is a\nnatural bijection between the set of G-orbits of an open subset of W and the\nset of G'-orbits of an open subset of W'. We can then apply already known\nconstruction methods to G'-invariant open subsets of W' and deduce with the\ncorrespondance new quotients of open G-invariant subsets of W. This is a new\nversion and a continuation of an older paper.",

By correcting for the\nenergy-dependent point-spread function of the ASCA instruments, we have\nexamined the temperature structure of the cluster. The cluster's core within 3'\nis found to have a temperature of 6.46+-0.87 keV, significantly higher than\n3.10+-1.19 keV in the surrounding region of r = 3 - 6'. This radially\ndecreasing temperature structure can be parameterized by a polytropic index of\n$\\gamma$ $\\simeq$ 1.45. The X-ray morphology of the cluster appears elongated\nand clumpy on scales $\\le$1'. These results, together with earlier {\\it ROSAT}\nand optical studies which revealed that the X-ray centroid and ellipticity of\nA2111 shift with spatial scale, are consistent with the hypothesis that the\ncluster is a dynamically young system. Most likely, the cluster has recently\nundergone a merger, which may also be responsible for the high fraction of blue\ngalaxies observed in the cluster. Alternatively, the temperature structure may\nalso be due to the gravitational potential of the cluster. We have further\nmeasured the emission weighted abundance of the X-ray-emitting intracluster\nmedium as 0.25$\\pm$0.14 solar. This value is similar to those of nearby\nclusters which do not show a large blue galaxy fraction, indicating that star\nformation in disk galaxies and subsequent loss to the medium do not drastically\nalter the average abundance of a cluster. This is consistent with recent\nresults which indicate that cluster abundances have remained constant since at\nleast z ~ 0.3.",

The CRS, in which cosmic rays with\ncomposition similar to that of the current epoch cosmic rays are accelerated\nout of fresh supernova ejecta and maintain a constant metallicity at all\nepochs, can account for the measured Be abundances with an acceleration\nefficiency that is in good agreement with the current epoch cosmic-ray data.\nThe LECR, in which a postulated low energy component also accelerated out of\nfresh ejecta coexists with the CRI cosmic rays, can account for the\nobservations as well, except that the required acceleration efficiency becomes\nprohibitively large for some of the parameters that have been previously\nassumed for this as-yet undetected cosmic-ray component.",

Therefore, large\nand massive quasi-stable structures of gas and dust should exist in the deep\ninterior of the giant elliptical hosts of double lobe radio galaxies. Recent\nmid-infrared observations with ISO revealed for the first time a bisymmetric\nspiral structure with the dimensions of a small galaxy at the centre of\nCentaurus A (Mirabel et al. 1999, A&A 341, 667).

Our considerations are supported by local spin density\ncalculations for this compound, which indeed indicate a ferromagnetic RuO2\nlayer. The Ru moment resides in t_2g orbitals but is characteristic of\nitinerant magnetism (and is sensitive to choice of exchange-correlation\npotential and to the atomic positions). Based on the small exchange splitting\nthat is induced in the Cu-O layers, the system seems capable of supporting\nsinglet superconductivity an FFLO-type order parameter and possibly a pi-phase\nalternation between layers. If instead the pairing is triplet in the RuO2\nlayers, it can be distinguished by a spin-polarized supercurrent. Either type\nof superconductivity seems to imply a spontaneous vortex phase if the\nmagnetization is rotated out of the plane.",

At every epoch higher density regions have much higher metallicity\nthan lower density regions. Moreover, the highest density regions quickly\napproach near solar metallicity and then saturate, while more typical regions\nslowly catch up. These results are much more consistent with observational data\nthan the simpler picture (adopted by many) of gradual, quasi-uniform increase\nof metallicity with time.",

    "summary": "In the 1980's, Belavin and Drinfeld classified solutions r of the classical\nYang-Baxter equation (CYBE) for simple Lie algebras \\mathfrak g satisfying 0\n\\neq r + r_{21} \\in (S^2 \\mathfrak{g})^{\\mathfrak{g}}. They proved that all\nsuch solutions fall into finitely many continuous families and introduced\ncombinatorial objects to label these families, Belavin-Drinfeld triples. In\n1993, Gerstenhaber, Giaquinto, and Schack attempted to quantize such solutions\nfor Lie algebras \\mathfrak{sl}(n). As a result, they formulated a conjecture\nstating that certain explicitly given elements R \\in Mat_n(\\mathbb C) \\otimes\nMat_n(\\mathbb C) satisfy the quantum Yang-Baxter equation (QYBE) and the Hecke\nrelation. Specifically, the conjecture assigns a family of such elements R to\nany Belavin-Drinfeld triple of type A_{n-1}. Following a suggestion from\nGerstenhaber and Giaquinto, we propose an alternate form for R, given by R_J =\nq^{r^0} J^{-1} R_s J_{21} q^{r^0}, for a suitable twist J and a diagonal matrix\nr^0, where R_s is the standard Drinfeld-Jimbo solution of the QYBE. We\nformulate the ``twist conjecture'', which states that R_J = R_{\\text{GGS}} and\nthat R_J satisfies the QYBE. Since R_J by construction satisfies the Hecke\nrelation, this conjecture implies the GGS conjecture. We check the twist\nconjecture by computer for n \\leq 12 and show that it is true modulo \\hbar^3.\nWe provide combinatorial formulas for coefficients in the matrices R_J,\nR_{\\text{GGS}} and prove both conjectures in the disjoint case---when \\Gamma_1\n\\cap \\Gamma_2 = \\emptyset---and in the orthogonal generalized disjoint case,\nwhich is a generalization of \\Gamma_1 \\perp \\Gamma_2. Finally, we prove the\ntwist conjecture for the Cremmer-Gervais triple and discuss cases in which it\nis known that R_J = R_{\\text{GGS}}.",

This\ncriterion is applied to the bihamiltonian open Toda lattice in a generic point,\nwhich is shown to be locally isomorphic to a Kronecker odd-dimensional pair of\nbrackets with constant coefficients. This shows that the open Toda lattice\ncannot be locally represented as a product of two bihamiltonian structures.\n  In a generic point the bihamiltonian periodic Toda lattice is shown to be\nisomorphic to a product of two open Toda lattices (one of which is a (trivial)\nstructure of dimension 1).\n  While the above results might be obtained by more traditional methods, we use\nan approach based on general results on geometry of webs. This demonstrates a\npossibility to apply a geometric language to problems on bihamiltonian\nintegrable systems, such a possibility may be no less important than the\nparticular results proven in this paper.\n  Based on these geometric approaches, we conjecture that decompositions\nsimilar to the decomposition of the periodic Toda lattice exist in local\ngeometry of the Volterra system, the complete Toda lattice, the\nmultidimensional Euler top, and a regular bihamiltonian Lie coalgebra.

We also have computed the electronic density of states for\nisolated tubes with different chiralities and radii confirming a correlation\nbetween the peak-structure in the DOS and the nanotube diameter, however the\nmetallic plateau in the DOS also depends on the nanotube chirality.\nFurthermore, the conduction and valence band structures are not fully\nsymmetrical to one another.

The corresponding optical depth, averaged over four directions,\nis 0.38 (+0.53, -0.15) 10^{-6}. All three candidates have long Einstein radius\ncrossing times ($\\sim$ 70 to 100 days).

Another candidate displays a modulation of the\nmagnification, which is compatible with the lensing of a binary source.\n  The interpretation of the optical depths inferred from these observations is\nhindered by the imperfect knowledge of the distance to the target stars.

The source lies at ~5\\arcdeg from the Galactic Center\nand was within the SIGMA field of view during the GRANAT surveys of this\nregion. The total exposure time of the Galactic Center was 11x10^6 s. The\nregular SIGMA observations revealed strong variability of the source: the\n40-150 keV flux varied at least by a factor of 8 on a time scale of a year,\nbetween less than 13 mCrab and ~100-110 mCrab. The average flux was ~60 mCrab\nin 1990-1998. The source's spectrum is well fitted by a power law with a photon\nindex \\alpha ~1.86 in the energy range 40 to 150 keV and becomes steeper at\nenergies above ~100 keV. The radio and hard X-ray properties of GRS 1758-258\nare similar to those of another Galactic Center source, 1E1740.7-2942. GRS\n1758-258 and 1E1740.7-2942 are the two brightest hard X-ray sources in the\nGalactic Center region. Both sources have radio jets, similar X-ray\nluminosities (~10^37 erg/s), and spectra, and exhibit variations in the hard\nX-ray flux on long times scales by a factor of ~10 or more . In contrast to\nmost of the known black hole candidates, which are X-ray transients, GRS\n1758-258 and 1E1740.7-2942 were detected by SIGMA during most of the\nobservations in 1990-1998. Assuming that this behavior of the sources implies\nthe suppression of accretion-disk instability in the region of partial hydrogen\nionization through X-ray heating, we impose constraints on the mass of the\noptical companion and on the orbital period of the binary system.",

The new\nconstraints on the viewing angle of the galactic Bar from stellar line-of-sight\nvelocities decrease further the ability of the Bar's distribution to account\nfor the observed micro-lensing optical depth toward Baade's window : our model\nreproduces only half the observed value.

The first UV spectra taken in June 1992, simultaneously\nwith ROSAT, show strong absorption lines of NV, CIV and SiIV, extending over a\nvelocity range from -1000 to -5000 km/s with respect to the corresponding line\ncentre. Our analysis shows that the Broad Emission Line Region (BELR) is, at\nleast partially, covered by the material causing these absorption lines. In the\nIUE spectrum taken in Jan. 1995, the continuum was a factor of two brighter and\nthe UV absorption lines are found to be considerably weaker than in 1992, but\nonly little variation in the emission line fluxes is found. With UV spectral\nindices of A_{uv} \\simeq 1.82 and 1.46 for the 1992 and 1995 data, the far UV\nspectrum is steep. Based on the emission line ratios and the broad band\nspectral energy distribution, we argue that the steepness of the UV spectrum is\nunlikely to be due to reddening. The soft X-ray emission in the ROSAT band is\nweak. A simple power-law model yields a very poor fit with a UV-to-X-ray\nspectral index A_{uvx}=2.32. Highly ionized (warm) absorption is suggested by\nthe ROSAT data.

The ASCA\nspectrum consists of an absorbed power-law, a 'soft excess' below 2 keV, and an\nFe K$\\alpha$ emission line at 6.4 keV.

Analysis of ROSAT HRI data reveals that the\nsoft X-ray emission is extended on kpc scales in this object, and the extended\ncomponent may account for most of the soft X-ray excess observed by the ASCA.\nThe result suggests that in this type 2 AGN, the 'soft excess' at least partly\ncomes from an extended region, imposing serious problem for the model in which\nthe source is partially covered.

    "summary": "This paper summarises a numerical investigation of how the usual\nmanifestations of chaos and regularity for flows in time-independent\nHamiltonians can be alterred by a systematic time-dependence of the form\narising naturally in an expanding Universe. If the time-dependence is not too\nstrong, the observed behaviour can be understood in an adiabatic approximation.\nOne still infers sharp distinctions between regular and chaotic behaviour, even\nthough ``regular'' does not mean ``periodic'' and ``chaotic'' will not in\ngeneral imply strictly exponential sensitivity towards small changes in initial\nconditions. However, these distinctions are no longer absolute, as it is\npossible for a single orbit to change from regular to chaotic and/or visa\nversa. If the time-dependence becomes too strong, the distinction between\nregular and chaotic can disappear so that no sensitive dependence on initial\nconditions is manifest.",

The observations cover quiescent, small\nflaring and outburst states of the system as defined by radio and X-ray\nmonitoring. The underlying infrared spectrum of the source, as observed during\nradio and X-ray quiescence and small flaring states, is one of broad, weak HeII\nand NV emission. Spectral variability in this state is dominated by modulation\nat the 4.8 hr orbital period of the system. H-band spectra confirm the\nsignificant hydrogen depletion of the mass donor. The closest spectral match to\nthe quiescent infrared spectrum of Cyg X-3 is an early-type WN Wolf-Rayet star.\n  In outburst, the infrared spectrum is dramatically different, with the\nappearance of very strong twin-peaked HeI emission displaying both day-to-day\nvariability and V(iolet)/R(ed) variations with orbital phase. The most likely\nexplanation appears to be an enhanced stellar wind from the companion. Thus\nX-ray and radio outbursts in this system are likely to originate in\nmass-transfer, and not disc, instabilities, and the lengthening of the orbital\nperiod will not be smooth but will be accelerated during these outbursts.\nFurthermore, the appearance of these lines is suggestive of an asymmetric\nemitting region. We propose that the wind in Cyg X-3 is significantly flattened\nin the plane of the binary orbit. This may explain the observed twin-peaked HeI\nfeatures as well as reconciling a massive Wolf-Rayet secondary with the\nrelatively small optical depth to X-rays, if the disc wind is inclined at some\nangle to the line of sight.",

We find that the analytic\nexpectation of Gunn & Gott (1972) relating the gravitational restoring force\nprovided by the disk to the ram pressure force, provides a good approximation\nto the radius that gas will be stripped from a galaxy. However, at small radii\nit is also important to consider the potential provided by the bulge component.\nA spiral galaxy passing through the core of a rich cluster such as Coma, will\nhave its gaseous disk truncated to $\\sim 4$ kpc, thus losing $\\sim 80%$ of its\ndiffuse gas mass. The timescale for this to occur is a fraction of a crossing\ntime $\\sim 10^7$ years. Galaxies orbiting within poorer clusters, or inclined\nto the direction of motion through the intra-cluster medium will lose\nsignificantly less gas. We conclude that ram-pressure alone is insufficient to\naccount for the rapid and widespread truncation of star-formation observed in\ncluster galaxies, or the morphological transformation of Sab's to S0's that is\nnecessary to explain the Butcher-Oemler effect.",

This combined with the unique signatures of the\ntime-resolved spectra of GRB990123 convincingly supports earlier predictions of\nthe saturated Comptonization model. Contrary to other suggestions, we find that\nthe entire continuum from optical to gamma-rays can be generated from a single\nsource of leptons (electrons and pairs). The optical flux only appears to lag\nthe gamma-ray flux due to the high initial Thomson depth of the plasma. Once\nthe plasma has completely thinned out, the late time afterglow behavior of our\nmodel is the same as in standard models based on the Blandford-McKee (1976)\nsolution.",

Compared to GHRS spectra of the N V and C IV absorption\nobtained ~2 years earlier, the kinematic components have not changed in radial\nvelocity, but the ionic column densities for two components have decreased. We\nattribute these variations to changes in the total column of gas, but for one\ncomponent, we cannot rule out changes in the ionization of the gas.\n  We have calculated photoionization models to match the UV column densities\nfrom each of the five components associated with the nucleus. In four of the\ncomponents, the ionization parameters (U = 0.15 - 0.80) and effective hydrogen\ncolumn densities (N = 6.0 x 10^18 cm^-2 -- 2.8 x 10^20 cm^-2) cannot produce\nthe O VII and O VIII absorption edges seen in the X-ray warm absorber. The\nremaining component is more highly ionized (U = 2.4, N = 6.5 x 10^21 cm^-2) and\nour model matches the previously observed X-ray absorption columns.

In contrast to\nprevious well-studied radio afterglows which rise to peak flux on a timescale\nof a week and then decay over several weeks to months, the radio emission from\nthis GRB was clearly detected one day after the burst, after which it rapidly\nfaded away. The simplest interpretation of this ``radio flare'' is that it\narises from the reverse shock. In the framework of the afterglow models\ndiscussed to date, a forward shock origin for the flare is ruled out by our\ndata. However, at late times, some radio afterglow emission (commensurate with\nthe observed late-time optical emission, the optical afterglow) is expected\nfrom the forward shock. The relative faintness of the observed late-time radio\nemission provides an independent indication for a jet-like geometry in this\nGRB. We use the same radio observations to constrain two key parameters of the\nforward shock, peak flux and peak frequency, to within a factor of two. These\nvalues are inconsistent with the notion advocated by several authors that the\nprompt optical emission detected by ROTSE smoothly joins the optical afterglow\nemission. Finally, with hindsight we now recognize another such radio flare and\nthis suggests that one out of eight GRBs has a detectable radio flare. This\nabundance coupled with the reverse shock interpretation suggests that the radio\nflare phenomenon has the potential to shed new light into the physics of\nreverse shocks in GRBs.",

On the contrary, bar\ninstability in HSBs leads to substantial loss of angular momentum of the\nstellar component and to an increase of central surface brightness. In both\ncases the remnant resembles a spheroidal galaxy with an exponential surface\nbrightness profile. A simple modeling of color evolution and interactions\ndriven star formation gives M/L ratios for the remnants that are roughly\nconsistent with observations.

Our semi-analytic method is based on a separation of\nphoton diffusion in frequency and real space. We use Monte Carlo simulation to\nderive the intensity and frequency of the scattered photons for a monochromatic\nincoming radiation. The outgoing spectrum is determined by integrating over the\nspectrum of the incoming radiation using the intensity to determine the correct\nweight. This method makes it possible to study the emerging radiation as a\nfunction of frequency and direction. As a first application we have studied the\neffects of finite optical depth and gas infall on the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect\n(not possible with the extended Kompaneets equation) and discuss the parameter\nrange in which the Boltzmann equation and its expansions can be used. For high\ntemperature clusters ($k_B T_e \\gtrsim 15$ keV) relativistic corrections based\non a fifth order expansion of the extended Kompaneets equation seriously\nunderestimate the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect at high frequencies. The\ncontribution from plasma infall is less important for reasonable velocities. We\ngive a convenient analytical expression for the dependence of the cross-over\nfrequency on temperature, optical depth, and gas infall speed.

This volume measure is thus\na preferred and universal choice for characterising the inherent spread,\ndispersion, localisation, etc, of the ensemble. Remarkably, this unique\n\"ensemble volume\" is a simple function of the ensemble entropy, and hence\nprovides a new geometric characterisation of the latter quantity. Applications\ninclude unified, volume-based derivations of the Holevo and Shannon bounds in\nquantum and classical information theory; a precise geometric interpretation of\nthermodynamic entropy for equilibrium ensembles; a geometric derivation of\nsemi-classical uncertainty relations; a new means for defining classical and\nquantum localization for arbitrary evolution processes; a geometric\ninterpretation of relative entropy; and a new proposed definition for the\nspot-size of an optical beam. Advantages of the ensemble volume over other\nmeasures of localization (root-mean-square deviation, Renyi entropies, and\ninverse participation ratio) are discussed.",

Each\nchain can now be described by an exact quantization condition which constrains\nit in terms of its neighbors, resulting in closed equilibrium conditions for\nthe global chain system; these are supplemented by the standard\n(Bohr-Sommerfeld) quantization conditions, which bind the infinite tail of each\nchain asymptotically. This reduced problem is then probed numerically for\neffective solvability upon test cases (mostly, symmetric quartic oscillators):\nwe find that the iterative enforcement of all the quantization conditions\ngenerates discrete chain dynamics which appear to converge geometrically\ntowards the correct eigenvalues/eigenfunctions.

The angular resolutions are ~50 and ~130\narcsec, therefore much higher than for the previously available radio images of\nthis region. The most interesting feature detected is a large-scale jet that\nconnects the inner radio lobe and the NML and that is imaged for the first\ntime. The NML itself appears as diffuse emission with a relatively bright ridge\non the eastern side. The radio morphology of Centaurus A and, in particular,\nits NML could be the result of a precessing jet that has undergone a strong\ninteraction with the environment at least in the northern side. The very big\ndrop in intensity between the inner jet and the large-scale jet can be\nexplained with a sequence of bursts of activity at different epochs in the life\nof the source. Alternatively (or additionally) a ``bursting bubble'' model is\nproposed which could also explain the good collimation of the large-scale jet.\nIn this model, the plasma accumulated in the inner lobe would be able to\n``burst'' out only through one nozzle that would be the region where the\nlarge-scale jet forms. From the comparison between the radio emission and the\nregions of ionized gas we find that the inner optical filament falls about 2\narcmin (~2 kpc) away from the large-scale radio jet. Thus, this filament does\nnot seem to have experienced a direct interaction with the radio plasma. The\nouter filaments appear to be, in projection, closer to the radio emission,\narguing for a direct interaction with the radio jet. However, also in this case\na more complicated interaction than assumed so far has to be occuring.",

Its spectral\ncomponents are for the first time simultaneously measured: a power-law with\nphoton spectral index ~1.9; the Compton-reflection of the primary power-law; a\nmoderately broad (>60 eV) K-alpha fluorescent line from neutral iron; and an\nabsorption edge, whose threshold energy is consistent with K-shell\nphotoionization from OVII. The amount of reflection and the iron line\nproperties are consistent with both being produced in a plane-parallel, X-ray\nilluminated relativistic accretion disc surrounding the nuclear black hole,\nseen at an inclination of 30 degrees. Any cutoff of the intrinsic continuum is\nconstrained to lay above 150 keV. The claim for a strongly variable soft excess\nis dismissed by our data and by a reanalysis of archival ASCA and ROSAT data.",

The power spectrum as observed\nwith the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer is characterized by a strong band-limited\nnoise component which is approximately flat below a 0.1-2.3 Hz break frequency;\nabove this frequency the power spectrum declines as a power law of index 0.9.\nAt the highest observed count rate a broad bump is superimposed on this\nband-limited noise. The power spectrum is very similar to that of other\nlow-luminosity neutron-star low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) and to black-hole\ncandidates when these types of source accrete at their lowest observed mass\naccretion rates. However, we identify one unusual aspect of the X-ray\nvariability of SLX 1735-269: the break frequency increases when the inferred\nmass accretion rate decreases. This is the opposite to what is normally\nobserved in other sources. The only source for which the same behavior has been\nobserved is the accretion-powered millisecond X-ray pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658. No\ncoherent millisecond pulsations were observed from SLX 1735-269 with an upper\nlimit on the amplitude of 2.2% rms. Observing this behavior in SLX 1735-269\nincreases the similarities between SAX J1808.4-3658 and the other neutron star\nLMXBs for which so far no coherent pulsations have been observed. We expect\nthat other sources will show the same behavior when these sources are studied\nin detail at their lowest mass accretion rates.",

It is argued that the criticism is not sound. Paradoxical features\nof the three-box example has been explained. It is explained that the elements\nof reality in the framework of time-symmetrized quantum theory are\ncounterfactual statements and, therefore, even conflicting elements of reality\ncan be associated with a single particle. It is shown how such\n``counterfactual'' elements of reality can be useful in the analysis of a\nphysical experiment (the three-box example).

Input stellar yields for\nneutron-rich nuclei have been separated into their s-process and r-process\ncomponents. The production of s-process elements in thermally pulsing\nasymptotic giant branch stars of low mass proceeds from the combined operation\nof two neutron sources: the dominant reaction 13C(alpha,n)16O, which releases\nneutrons in radiative conditions during the interpulse phase, and the reaction\n22Ne(alpha,n)25Mg, marginally activated during thermal instabilities. The\nresulting s-process distribution is strongly dependent on the stellar\nmetallicity. For the standard model discussed in this paper, it shows a sharp\nproduction of the Ba-peak elements around Z = Z_sun/4. Concerning the r-process\nyields, we assume that the production of r-nuclei is a primary process\noccurring in stars near the lowest mass limit for Type II supernova\nprogenitors. The r-contribution to each nucleus is computed as the difference\nbetween its solar abundance and its s-contribution given by the Galactic\nchemical evolution model at the epoch of the solar system formation. We compare\nour results with spectroscopic abundances of elements from Ba to Eu at various\nmetallicities (mainly from F and G stars) showing that the observed trends can\nbe understood in the light of the present knowledge of neutron capture\nnucleosynthesis.

The equation of motion for a charged sphere of finite size, which\nin contrast is claimed to be asymmetric because of the finite propagation time\nof its (retarded) self-forces, is shown to possess the same asymmetry (or the\nsame symmetry, depending on the definition) as that for a point charge.

Each of these states is connected to the initial state $\\state{i}$ with\na coupling proportional to the pump pulse and to the final state $\\state{f}$\nwith a coupling proportional to the Stokes pulse, thus forming a parallel\nmulti-$\\Lambda$ system. It is shown that the dark (trapped) state exists only\nwhen the ratio between each pump coupling and the respective Stokes coupling is\nthe same for all intermediate states. We derive the conditions for existence of\na more general adiabatic-transfer state which includes transient contributions\nfrom the intermediate states but still transfers the population from state\n$\\state{i}$ to state $\\state{f}$ in the adiabatic limit. We present various\nnumerical examples for success and failure of multi-$\\Lambda$ STIRAP which\nillustrate the analytic predictions. Our results suggest that in the general\ncase of arbitrary couplings, it is most appropriate to tune the pump and Stokes\nlasers either just below or just above all intermediate states.",

The SCF is a measure of similarity\nbetween neighboring spectra in the data cube.

From\nhigh resolution (R = 21500) spectra at the 12CO (2-0) bandhead at 2.3 micron we\nderive a line-of-sight stellar velocity dispersion sigma = (33 +- 3) km/s.\n  To interpret this observation we construct dynamical models based on the\nJeans equation for a spherical system. The light distribution of the cluster is\nmodeled using an isophotal analysis of an HST V-band image from the HST Data\nArchive, combined with new ground-based K-band imaging. Under the assumption of\nan isotropic velocity distribution, the observed kinematics imply a K-band\nmass-to-light ratio M/L_K = 0.05, and a cluster mass M ~ 6 times 10^6 Msun. We\nmodel the mass-to-light ratio with the `starburst99' stellar population\nsynthesis models of Leitherer and collaborators, and infer a best-fitting\ncluster age in the range 63-630 Myears. Although this result depends somewhat\non a number of uncertainties in the modeling (e.g., the assumed extinction\nalong the line-of-sight towards the nucleus, the IMF of the stellar population\nmodel, and the velocity dispersion anisotropy of the cluster), none of these\ncan be plausibly modified to yield a significantly larger age. We discuss the\nimplications of this result on possible scenarios for the frequency of nuclear\nstarbursts and their impact on secular evolution of spiral galaxy nuclei.\n  As a byproduct of our analysis, we infer that IC 342 cannot have any central\nblack hole more massive than 0.5 million solar masses.

    "summary": "New calculations of the Galactic contamination over microwave background\nradiation anisotropies are carried out. On one hand, when a frequency-dependent\ncontrast of molecular clouds with respect to the Galactic background of the\ndiffuse interstellar medium is taken into account, the anisotropic amplitude\nproduced by Galactic dust is increased with respect to previous calculations\nand this is of the same order as that of the data from the observations. On the\nother hand, if we take into account rotational dust emission, for instance, a\nfrequency independence of anisotropies in the microwave range may be obtained.\n  This leads to the possibility that under some particular, but not impossible,\nconditions all the microwave background radiation anisotropies may be due to\nGalactic foregrounds rather than cosmological in origin. Moreover, a suspected\ncoincidence between the typical angular sizes of the microwave background\nradiation anisotropies and those of nearby molecular clouds makes more\nplausible the hypothesis of a purely Galactic origin for these anisotropies. It\nis also argued that the correlation among structures at different frequencies,\nthe comparison of the power spectrum at different frequencies and the galactic\nlatitude dependence of the anisotropies are not yet proofs in favour of either\na cosmological or Galactic origin.",

The\njump in HeII intensity (a factor of more than two) and in velocity (~200--300\nkm/s) clarifies the shock nature of the spiral structure. The HeII shocks show\nan azimuthal extent of ~90 degrees, a shallow power-law emissivity ~V^{-1}, an\nupper limit of 30 degrees in opening angle, and a flux contribution of 15 per\ncent of the total disc emission. We discuss the results in view of recent\nsimulations of accretion discs which show that spiral shocks can be raised in\nthe accretion disc by the secondary star.",

The ``corkscrew'' pattern consists of two emission-line\npulses, separated by half the white dwarf spin period, and moving from red to\nblue velocities. The detected emission-line pulsations have an amplitude of\n1.1--2.7 per cent in the He II and Balmer emission lines on the 545-s spin\nperiod of the white dwarf which compare to 3.5-4.8 per cent for the continuum\ndouble-peak pulsations. We image the emission-line pulse pattern and is shown\nto lag the continuum pulse by 0.12 spin cycles. We interpret the pattern by\ninvoking an accretion curtain from the disrupted, inner disc to the two poles\nof the magnetic white dwarf. The semi-amplitude of the He II pulse of 408+-35\nkm/s can be used to constrain the size of the magnetosphere, R ~ 4.1 x 10^4 km,\nand the magnetic moment of the white dwarf (~2.4 10^32 G cm^3). Power spectra\nshow dominant frequencies at 2 \\omega and 2 (\\omega-\\Omega) which suggest\nreprocessing of the white dwarf's illuminating beams in the accretion disc.\nFinally, the steady He II emission line shows a strong sinusoidal component\nmoving from red to blue on the orbital period, with a width similar to that\nexpected from irradiation of the secondary star.

The quantization consists of two procedures. One is\nrelated with quantization of the asymptotic Virasoro symmetry. A notion of the\nVirasoro deformation of 3-geometry is introduced. For a given black hole, the\ndeformation of the exterior of the outer horizon is identified with a product\nof appropriate coadjoint orbits of the Virasoro groups $\\hat{diff S^1}_{\\pm}$.\nIts quantization provides unitary irreducible representations of the Virasoro\nalgebra, in which state of the black hole becomes primary.

By an identification of these topological operators with zero\nmodes of the Liouville field, the aforementioned unitary representations\nreveal, as far as $c \\gg 1$, as the Hilbert space of this two-dimensional\nconformal field theory. This conformal field theory, living on the cylinder at\ninfinity of the black hole and having continuous spectrums, can recognize the\nouter horizon only as a it one-dimensional object in $SL_2({\\bf R})$ and\nrealize it as insertions of the corresponding vertex operator.

Departures from the\ncanonical scenario for a merger involving two large spiral galaxies are found\nin all three Toomre Sequence mergers studied. Our data suggest that one of the\nprogentor disks in NGC 520 and NGC 3921 were relatively gas-poor. A detailed\ncomparison of these optically selected mergers and more luminous IR selected\nmergers is deferred to a companion paper (Paper II).",

Next, we apply this\nlinear extrapolation to precisely measured Drell-Yan cross sections for 800 GeV\nprotons incident on a variety of nuclear targets which exhibit a deviation from\nlinear scaling in the atomic number A. We show that this deviation can be\naccounted for by energy degradation of the proton as it passes through the\nnucleus if account is taken of the time delay of particle production due to\nquantum coherence. We infer an average proper coherence time of 0.4 +/- 0.1\nfm/c, corresponding to a coherence path length of 8 +/- 2 fm in the rest frame\nof the nucleus. Finally, we apply the linear extrapolation to measured J/Psi\nproduction cross sections for 200 and 450 GeV/c protons incident on a variety\nof nuclear targets. Our analysis takes into account energy loss of the beam\nproton, the time delay of particle production due to quantum coherence, and\nabsorption of the J/Psi on nucleons. The best representation is obtained for a\ncoherence time of 0.5 fm/c, which is consistent with Drell-Yan production, and\nan absorption cross section of 3.6 mb, which is consistent with the value\ndeduced from photoproduction of the J/Psi on nuclear targets.",

We take into\naccount the dependence on the shape and evolution of the CDM power spectrum,\nand allow the bias to be nonlinear and/or evolving in time, using an extension\nof Fry's (1996) bias-evolution model. We derive a scale-dependent,\nleading-order correction to the standard perturbative expression for $S_3$ in\nthe case of nonlinear biasing, as defined for the unsmoothed galaxy and\ndark-matter fields, and find that this correction becomes large when probing\npositive effective power-spectrum indices. This term implies that the inferred\nnonlinear-bias parameter, as usually defined in terms of the smoothed density\nfields, might depend on the chosen smoothing scale. In general, we find that\nthe dependence of $S_3$ on the biasing scheme can substantially outweigh that\non the adopted cosmology. We demonstrate that the normalized 3PCF, $Q$, is an\nill-behaved quantity, and instead investigate $Q_V$, the variance-normalized\n3PCF. The configuration dependence of $Q_V$ shows similarly strong\nsensitivities to the bias scheme as $S_3$, but also exhibits significant\ndependence on the form of the CDM power spectrum. Though the degeneracy of\n$S_3$ with respect to the cosmological parameters and constant linear- and\nnonlinear-bias parameters can be broken by the full configuration dependence of\n$Q_V$, neither statistic can distinguish well between evolving and non-evolving\nbias scenarios. We show that this can be resolved, in principle, by considering\nthe redshift dependence of $\\zeta$.",

The light curves of\nSN 1997br are similar to those of SN 1991T, with slow decline rates after the B\nmaximum. Well-sampled data before the B maximum show unambiguously that SN\n1997br rises more slowly and has a wider peak than normal type Ia supernovae.\nThe optical color evolution of SN 1997br is also similar to that of SN 1991T.\nWe estimate the extinction of SN 1997br to be E(B-V) = 0.35+/-0.10 mag by\ncomparing its BVRI light curves with those of SN 1991T and by measureing the\nequivalent width of interstellar Na I D absorption lines. We have conducted a\nthorough comparison of the spectroscopic evolution of SN 1997br, SN 1991T, and\nSN 1994D. Although SN 1997br is generally very similar to SN 1991T, it shows\nsome interesting differences at various epoches. Spectra of SN 1997br seem to\nindicate an earlier transition to the dominant phase of Fe-peak elements after\nthe B maximum. Si II lines in SN 1997br show a very short duration after the B\nmaximum.

Our survey\nlimiting R, I, and Z magnitudes are 23.2, 21.8, and 21.0, respectively. From\nour colour-magnitude diagrams, we have selected 49 faint objects, which\nsmoothly extrapolate the photometric sequence defined by more massive known\nmembers. Adopting the currently accepted age interval of 2-10 Myr for the Orion\n1b association and considering recent evolutionary models, our objects may span\na mass range from 0.1 down to 0.02 Msun, well within the substellar regime.\nFollow-up low-resolution optical spectroscopy (635-920 nm) for eight of our\ncandidates (I=16-19.5) shows that they have spectral types M6-M8.5 which are\nconsistent with the expectations for true members. Compared with their Pleiades\ncounterparts of similar types, Halpha emission is generally stronger, while NaI\nand KI absorption lines appear weaker, as expected for lower surface gravities\nand younger ages. Additionally, TiO bands and in particular VO bands appear\nclearly enhanced in our candidate with the latest spectral type, SOri 45 (M8.5,\nI=19.5), compared to objects of similar types in older clusters and the field.\nWe have estimated the mass of this candidate at only 0.020-0.040 Msun, hence it\nis one of the least massive brown dwarfs yet discovered. We also discuss in\nthis paper the potential role of deuterium as a tracer of both substellar\nnature and age in very young clusters.",

As an application\nwe start by approximating the capacitance matrix by its self-capacitive limit\nand in the presence of an external uniform background of charges, $q_x$. In\nthis limit we obtain the zero-temperature superconductor-insulator phase\ndiagram, $E_J^{\\rm crit}(E_C,q_x)$, that improves upon previous theoretical\nresults that used a mean field theory approximation. Next we obtain a\nclosed-form expression for the conductivity of a square array, and derive a\nuniversal scaling relation valid about the zero--temperature quantum critical\npoint. In the latter regime the energy scale is determined by temperature and\nwe establish universal scaling forms for the frequency dependence of the\nconductivity.",

It extends\nthe meaning of ``measurement'' to include all property-indicating facts.\nIntrinsically space is undifferentiated: there are no points on which a world\nof locally instantiated physical properties could be built. Instead, reality is\nbuilt on facts, in the sense that the properties of things are extrinsic, or\nsupervenient on property-indicating facts. The actual extent to which the world\nis spatially and temporally differentiated (that is, the extent to which\nspatiotemporal relations and distinctions are warranted by the facts) is\nnecessarily limited. Notwithstanding that the state vector does nothing but\nassign probabilities, quantum mechanics affords a complete understanding of the\nactual world. If there is anything that is incomplete, it is the actual world,\nbut its incompleteness exists only in relation to a conceptual framework that\nis more detailed than the actual world. Two deep-seated misconceptions are\nresponsible for the interpretational difficulties associated with quantum\nmechanics: the notion that the spatial and temporal aspects of the world are\nadequately represented by sets with the cardinality of the real numbers, and\nthe notion of an instantaneous state that evolves in time. The latter is an\nunwarranted (in fact, incoherent) projection of our apparent ``motion in time''\ninto the world of physics. Equally unwarranted, at bottom, is the use of causal\nconcepts. There nevertheless exists a ``classical'' domain in which language\nsuggestive of nomological necessity may be used. Quantum mechanics not only is\nstrictly consistent with the existence of this domain but also presupposes it\nin several ways.",

We show how\nsingularity pattern of the test is transformed into that of ultradiscrete\nequation. The ultradiscrete solution pattern can be interpreted as a perturbed\nsolution. We can also check an integrability of a given equation by a\nperturbation growth of a solution, namely Lyapunov exponent.

Gluon\njets defined in this manner are equivalent to gluon jets produced from a color\nsinglet point source and thus correspond to the definition employed for most\ntheoretical calculations. In a separate stage of the analysis, we select quark\njets in a manner to correspond to calculations, as the particles in hemispheres\nof flavor tagged light quark (uds) events. We present the distributions of\nrapidity, scaled energy, the logarithm of the momentum, and transverse momentum\nwith respect to the jet axes, for charged particles in these gluon and quark\njets. We also examine the charged particle multiplicity distributions of the\njets in restricted intervals of rapidity. For soft particles at large\ntransverse momentum, we observe the charged particle multiplicity ratio of\ngluon to quark jets to be 2.29 +- 0.09 +- 0.15 in agreement with the prediction\nthat this ratio should approximately equal the ratio of QCD color factors,\nCA/CF = 2.25. The intervals used to define soft particles and large transverse\nmomentum for this result, p<4 GeV/c and 0.8<p_t<3.0 GeV/c, are motivated by the\npredictions of the Herwig Monte Carlo multihadronic event generator.\nAdditionally, our gluon jet data allow a sensitive test of the phenomenon of\nnon-leading QCD terms known as color reconnection. We test the model of color\nreconnection implemented in the Ariadne Monte Carlo multihadronic event\ngenerator and find it to be disfavored by our data.",

This grouping effect results from the dynamical feedback governing\nthe game's time-evolution, and is not reproduced if the agents are fed a random\nhistory.",

Redshifts have been determined for 19 (40%) of the objects. The\noptical spectra of the GPS sources identified with low redshift galaxies show\ndeep stellar absorption features. This confirms previous suggestions that their\noptical light is not significantly contaminated by AGN-related emission, but is\ndominated by a population of old (>9 Gyr) and metal-rich (>0.2 [Fe/H]) stars,\njustifying the use of these (probably) young radio sources as probes of galaxy\nevolution. The optical spectra of GPS sources identified with quasars are\nindistinguishable from those of flat spectrum quasars, and clearly different\nfrom the spectra of Compact Steep Spectrum (CSS) quasars. The redshift\ndistribution of the GPS quasars in our radio-faint sample is comparable to that\nof the bright samples presented in the literature, peaking at z ~ 2-3. It is\nunlikely that a significant population of low redshift GPS quasars is missed\ndue to selection effects in our sample. We therefore claim that there is a\ngenuine difference between the redshift distributions of GPS galaxies and\nquasars, which, because it is present in both the radio-faint and bright\nsamples, can not be due to a redshift-luminosity degeneracy. It is therefore\nunlikely that the GPS quasars and galaxies are unified by orientation, unless\nthe quasar opening angle is a strong function of redshift. We suggest that the\nGPS quasars and galaxies are unrelated populations and just happen to have\nidentical observed radio-spectral properties, and hypothesise that GPS quasars\nare a sub-class of flat spectrum quasars.",

Anomalously large variations in the\npulsar's apparent spin-down rate have suggested the presence of a second\ncompanion in a much wider orbit. Using timing observations made on more than\nseven hundred days spanning eleven years, we confirm this anomalous timing\nbehavior. We explicitly demonstrate, for the first time, that a timing model\nconsisting of the sum of two non-interacting Keplerian orbits can account for\nthe observed signal. Both circular and elliptical orbits are allowed, although\nhighly eccentric orbits require improbable orbital geometries.\n  The motion of the pulsar in the inner orbit is very nearly a Keplerian\nellipse, but the tidal effects of the outer companion cause variations in the\norbital elements. We have measured the change in the projected semi-major axis\nof the orbit, which is dominated by precession-driven changes in the orbital\ninclination. This measurement, along with limits on the rate of change of other\norbital elements, can be used to significantly restrict the properties of the\nouter orbit. We find that the second companion most likely has a mass m~0.01\nMsun --- it is almost certainly below the hydrogen burning limit (m<0.036 Msun,\n95% confidence) --- and has a current distance from the binary of ~35 AU and\norbital period of order one hundred years. Circular (and near-circular) orbits\nare allowed only if the pulsar magnetic field is ~3x10^9 G, an order of\nmagnitude higher than a typical millisecond pulsar field strength. In this\ncase, the companion has mass m~1.2x10^-3 Msun and orbital period ~62 years.",

We find that the phase diagram, comprising of the\namplitudes of the respective gaps (SC and SDW) Vs. band filling resembles to\nthat of the high T_c cuprates only when the order parameter of the\nsuperconducting phase has d-wave symmetry.

This theory\ncontains both bosons and fermions and it is seen to arise as a projection of\nthe supersymmetric gauge theory related to the D5-D1 system of the type IIB\ntheory. The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula is reproduced exactly using the\ndual conformal field theory.",

We establish this\nrelationship in two important burst samples using the cross-correlation lags\nbetween low (25-50 keV) and high (100-300 keV and > 300 keV) energy bands. For\na set of seven bursts (six with redshifts) observed by CGRO/BATSE and BeppoSAX\nwhich also have optical or radio counterparts, the gamma/X peak flux ratios and\npeak luminosities are anti-correlated with spectral lag. For the 174 brightest\nBATSE bursts with durations longer than 2 s and significant emission above 300\nkeV, a similar anti-correlation is evident between gamma-ray hardness ratio or\npeak flux, and spectral lag. For the six bursts with redshifts, the connection\nbetween peak luminosity and spectral lag is well-fitted by a power-law. GRB\n980425 (if associated with SN 1998bw) would appear to extend this trend\nqualitatively, but with a lag of ~ 4-5 s and luminosity of ~ 1.3x10^47 ergs\ns^-1, it falls below the power-law relationship by a factor of ~ 460. As noted\npreviously by Band, most lags are concentrated on the short end of the lag\ndistribution, near 100 ms, suggesting that the GRB luminosity distribution is\npeaked on its high end, e.g. N(L) proportional to L^beta, with positive beta.",

    "summary": "We identify a new mechanism of internal dissipation of rotational kinetic\nenergy in spinning dust grains, arising from the reorientation of nuclear\nangular momentum, e.g., spins of protons. Grain rotation induces magnetization\nof the nuclear spin system, with net alignment of nuclear spins parallel to the\ngrain angular velocity. When the grain does not rotate around a principal axis,\nthe nuclear magnetization vector precesses in grain body coordinates, resulting\nin dissipation of energy. The analogous process involving electron spins was\ndiscovered by Purcell and termed ``Barnett relaxation''. We revisit the physics\nof the ``Barnett relaxation'' process and correct the estimate for the Barnett\nrelaxation rate. We show that nuclear relaxation can be orders of magnitude\nmore important than Barnett relaxation. This finding implies that the processes\nof ``thermal flipping'' and ``thermal trapping'' are important for a broad\nrange of grain sizes.",

For a long\ntime the only mechanism of reheating in such non-oscillatory (NO) models was\nbased on gravitational particle production in an expanding universe. This\nmechanism is very inefficient. We will show that it may lead to cosmological\nproblems associated with large isocurvature fluctuations and overproduction of\ndangerous relics such as gravitinos and moduli fields. We also note that the\nsetting of initial conditions for the stage of reheating in these models should\nbe reconsidered. All of these problems can be resolved in the context of the\nrecently proposed scenario of instant preheating if there exists an interaction\n${g^2} \\phi^2\\chi^2$ of the inflaton field $\\phi$ with another scalar field\n$\\chi$.

The images, taken in open filter (50CCD) mode, clearly reveal\nthe presence of a galaxy which was obscured in earlier (June 1997) HST images\nby emission from the optical transient (OT). The galaxy is regular in shape:\nafter correcting for the HST/STIS PSF, it is well-fitted by an exponential disk\nwith a scale length of 0.\"046 +/- 0.\"006 and an ellipticity of 0.70 +/- 0.07.\nAll observations are marginally consistent with a continuous decline in OT\nemission as t^{-1.3} beginning two days after outburst; however, we find no\ndirect evidence in the image for emission from the OT, and the surface\nbrightness profile of the galaxy is most regular if we assume that the OT\nemission is negligible, suggesting that the OT may have faded more rapidly at\nlate times than is predicted by the power-law decay. Due to the wide bandwidth\nof the STIS clear mode, the estimated magnitude of the galaxy is dependent on\nthe galaxy spectrum that is assumed. Using colors obtained from late-time\nground-based observations to constrain the spectrum, we find V = 25.4 +/- 0.15,\na few tenths of a magnitude brighter than earlier ground-based estimates that\nwere obtained by observing the total light of the galaxy and the OT and then\nsubtracting the estimated OT brightness assuming it fades as a single\npower-law. This again suggests that the OT may have faded faster at late time\nthan the power-law predicts. The position of the OT agrees with that of the\nisophotal center of the galaxy to 0.\"01. This remarkable agreement raises the\npossibility that the GRB may have been associated with either an active\ngalactic nucleus or a nuclear starburst.",

    "summary": "In this paper we continue the study of the path-integral formulation of\nclassical mechanics and in particular we better clarify, with respect to\nprevious papers, the geometrical meaning of the variables entering this\nformulation. With respect to the first paper with the same title, we {\\it\ncorrect} here the set of transformations for the auxiliary variables\n$\\lambda_{a}$. We prove that under this new set of transformations the\nHamiltonian ${\\widetilde{\\cal H}}$, appearing in our path-integral, is an exact\nscalar and the same for the Lagrangian. Despite this different transformation,\nthe variables $\\lambda_{a}$ maintain the same operatorial meaning as before but\non a different functional space. Cleared up this point we then show that the\nspace spanned by the whole set of variables ($\\phi, c, \\lambda,\\bar c$) of our\npath-integral is the cotangent bundle to the {\\it reversed-parity} tangent\nbundle of the phase space ${\\cal M}$ of our system and it is indicated as\n$T^{\\star}(\\Pi T{\\cal M})$. In case the reader feel uneasy with this strange\n{\\it Grassmannian} double bundle, we show in this paper that it is possible to\nbuild a different path-integral made only of {\\it bosonic} variables. These\nturn out to be the coordinates of $T^{\\star}(T^{\\star}{\\cal M})$ which is the\ndouble cotangent bundle of phase-space.",

According to the\nstandard argument, the thermal relaxation time of the system is around $Nt_c$,\nwhere $N$ is the number of sheets and $t_c$ is the crossing time. It has been\nclaimed that the system does not reach the thermal equilibrium in this thermal\nrelaxation timescale, and that it takes much longer time for the system to\nreach true thermal equilibrium.\n  We demonstrate that this behavior is explained simply by the fact that the\nrelaxation time is long. The relaxation time of sheets with average binding\nenergy is $\\sim 20 Nt_c$, and that of sheets with high energy can exceed $1000\nNt_c$. Thus, one needs to take the average over the relaxation timescale of\nhigh-energy sheets, if one wants to look at the thermal characteristic of these\nhigh energy sheets.",

The refurbished procedure\ntakes into account the full covariance matrix of the Hipparcos measurements\ninstead of standard errors only, allows for internal motions of the stars, and\nreplaces the grid-based approach by a direct minimization. The method is tested\non Monte Carlo simulations of moving groups, and applied to the Hyades.

The case k=2 corresponds to the celebrated result of Hurwitz on\nthe number of topologically distinct holomorphic functions on the 2-sphere that\npreserve a given number of elementary branch point singularities. In this case\nthe monodromy group is the alternating group, and this is another case that, in\nprinciple, is of considerable interest.\n  We conjecture an explicit form, for arbitrary k, for the generating series\nfor $c_k(\\alpha)$, and prove that it holds for factorisations of permutations\nwith one, two and three cycles ($\\alpha$ is a partition with at most three\nparts). The generating series is naturally expressed in terms of the symmetric\nfunctions dual to those introduced by Macdonald for the ``top'' connection\ncoefficients in the class algebra of the symmetric group.\n  Our approach is to determine a differential equation for the generating\nseries from a combinatorial analysis of the creation and annihilation of cycles\nin products under the minimality condition.",

The Lense-Thirring effect is a\ntiny perturbation of the motion of a free-falling particle near a massive\nrotating object, first calculated by the physicists J. Lense and H. Thirring in\n1918 using general relativity. The Lense-Thirring effect can also be thought of\nas the 'dragging of inertial frames', as first named by Einstein himself. The\namount of frame dragging varies with height above the spinning earth.\nEinstein's general relativity predicts the value of this effect near the earth,\nbut the effect has not yet been accurately verified experimentally. However,\nrecent work using the LAGEOS series, earth orbiting satellites has rendered an\nunconfirmed experimental value that agrees with theory to an accuracy of about\n20 %. Our physical model is based on the disturbance of the electrically\ncharged virtual particles of the quantum vacuum in a state of free-fall near a\nmassive spinning object. We calculate the Lense-Thirring effect on the earth's\nsurface using this model that is in good agreement with the value derived from\ngeneral relativity.",

We apply detailed Non-Local Thermodynamic\nEquilibrium (Non-LTE) models including metal line opacities to the observed\nLECS spectrum.

We find that models with effective temperatures above ~1e6 K or below\n\\~7.5e5 K can be excluded. If we assume a single model component for RX J0925\nwe observe a significant discrepancy between the model and the data above the\nNeIX edge energy at 1.19 keV. This is consistent with earlier observations with\nROSAT and ASCA. The only way to account for the emission above ~1.2 keV is by\nintroducing a second spectral (plasma) component. This plasma component may be\nexplained by a shocked wind originating from the compact object or from the\nirradiated companion star.

This proof is obtained as a\nconsequence of an exact renormalization group equation for the photon mass. We\nobtain Josephson's relation directly in the form $\\rho_{s}\\sim t^{\\nu}$, that\nis, we do not need to assume that the hyperscaling relation holds. Next, we\ngive an interpretation of a recent experiment performed in thin films of\n$YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\\delta}$. We argue that the measured mean field like\nbehavior of the penetration depth exponent $\\nu'$ is possibly associated with a\nnon-trivial critical behavior and we predict the exponents $\\nu=1$ and\n$\\alpha=-1$ for the correlation lenght and specific heat, respectively. In the\nsecond part of the paper we discuss the scaling behavior in the continuum dual\nGinzburg-Landau model. After reviewing lattice duality in the Ginzburg-Landau\nmodel, we discuss the continuum dual version by considering a family of\nscalings characterized by a parameter $\\zeta$ introduced such that\n$m_{h,0}^2\\sim t^{\\zeta}$, where $m_{h,0}$ is the bare mass of the magnetic\ninduction field.

The goal of this article is to show that with some\nadditional work, one can prove finite time die-out for two types of systems of\nstochastic differential equations on the lattice Z^d. Our first system involves\nthe heat equation on the lattice Z^d, with a nonlinear noise term u(t,x)^gamma\ndB_x(t), with 1/2 <= gamma < 1. The B_x are independent Brownian motions. When\ngamma = 1/2, the measure which puts mass u(t,x) at x is a super-random walk and\nit is well-known that the process becomes extinct in finite time a.s.\nFinite-time extinction is known to be a.s. false if gamma = 1. For 1/2 < gamma\n< 1, we show finite-time die-out by breaking up the solution into pieces, and\nshowing that each piece dies in finite time. Our second example involves the\nmutually catalytic branching system of stochastic differential equations on\nZ^d, which was first studied by Dawson and Perkins. Roughly speaking, this\nprocess consists of 2 superprocesses with the continuous time simple random\nwalk as the underlying spatial motion. Furthermore, each process stimulates\nbranching and dying in the other process. By using a somewhat different\nargument, we show that, depending on the initial conditions, finite time\nextinction of one type may occur with probability 0, or with probability\narbitrarily close to 1.",

Without order-parameter\nsuppression, the zero-energy resonance appears only in the unitary (i.e.,\nstrong impurity) limit. However, suppression makes the resonance appear even\nwhen the impurity is much weaker. To model this situation, we make the physical\nhypothesis that the order parameter is reduced whenever one electron of a\nCooper pair encounters the impurity, a hypothesis that retains the exact\nsolvability of the problem. In this way, we determine that suppression of the\norder parameter drives the effective strength of the impurity towards the\nunitary limit. We determine the order-parameter reduction variationally, and\nshow that the ratios between the main energy scales--the band width and\nsuperconducting gap--strongly affect this reduction and, in consequence, the\nposition and width of the resonance.",

This results in a different pattern of sparticle masses and mixing\nangles from what is expected in the minimal supergravity model (mSUGRA) with\nuniversal GUT scale gaugino masses. We find that the resulting signal cross\nsections, and hence the reach of the Tevatron, are sensitive to the gaugino\nmasses at the GUT scale. In the 24 model, the large splitting amongst the two\nlightest neutralinos leads to SUSY events containing many isolated leptons,\nincluding events with a real leptonic Z boson plus jets plus missing energy\nsignal which is visible over much of parameter space. In contrast, in the 75\nand 200 models, the reach via leptonic SUSY signals is greatly reduced relative\nto mSUGRA, and the signal is usually visible only via the canonical $\\eslt\n+$jets channel.",

We find that\ngamma-ray fluxes are not correlated with the simultaneous optical observations,\nand the gamma-ray spectra cannot be extrapolated simply to the optical fluxes.\nThe burst is well fit by the standard four-parameter GRB function, with the\nexception that excess emission compared to this function is observed below ~15\nkeV during some time intervals. The burst is characterized by the typical\nhard-to-soft and hardness-intensity correlation spectral evolution patterns.\nThe energy of the peak of the nu f_nu spectrum, E_p, reaches an unusually high\nvalue during the first intensity spike, 1470 +/- 110 keV, and then falls to\n\\~300 keV during the tail of the burst. The high-energy spectrum above ~MeV is\nconsistent with a power law with a photon index of about -3. By fluence, GRB\n990123 is brighter than all but 0.4% of the GRBs observed with BATSE, clearly\nplacing it on the -3/2 power-law portion of the intensity distribution.\nHowever, the redshift measured for the afterglow is inconsistent with the\nEuclidean interpretation of the -3/2 power-law.

    "summary": "We present numerical studies of the nonlinear, resistive magnetohydrodynamic\n(MHD) evolution of coronal loops. For these simulations we assume that the\nloops carry no net current, as might be expected if the loop had evolved due to\nvortex flows. Furthermore the initial equilibrium is taken to be a cylindrical\nflux tube with line-tied ends. For a given amount of twist in the magnetic\nfield it is well known that once such a loop exceeds a critical length it\nbecomes unstableto ideal MHD instabilities. The early evolution of these\ninstabilities generates large current concentrations. Firstly we show that\nthese current concentrations are consistent with the formation of a current\nsheet. Magnetic reconnection can only occur in the vicinity of these current\nconcentrations and we therefore couple the resistivity to the local current\ndensity. This has the advantage of avoiding resistive diffusion in regions\nwhere it should be negligible. We demonstrate the importance of this procedure\nby comparison with simulations based on a uniform resistivity. From our\nnumerical experiments we are able to estimate some observational signatures for\nunstable coronal loops. These signatures include: the timescale of the loop\nbrightening; the temperature increase; the energy released and the predicted\nobservable flow speeds. Finally we discuss to what extent these observational\nsignatures are consistent with the properties of transient brightening loops.",

We use Grothendieck's K-functor to construct\nfinite-dimensional vectorspaces of non-integer rank. The rank will play the\nrole of the ``4-2eps'' in conventional dimensional regularization. We then\ndefine two regularization schemes, one similar to the 't Hooft--Veltman scheme,\nthe other one as a scheme, where all algebra is performed in four dimensions.\nLorentz invariance is maintained in both cases. However the structure of the\nClifford algebra cannot be preserved. We show that the HV-like scheme and the\nfour-dimensional scheme correspond to two different deformations of the\nClifford algebra. It is the purpose of this paper to advocate the\nfour-dimensional scheme for future calculations, since it is easier to use.

(1997: ApJ 491, L31) in which\nwe presented an outline of the analysis of 60 spectra from a follow-up program\nto the Two Micron Galactic Survey (TMGS) project in the l=27 deg., b=0 deg.\narea. In this second part, we present a more detailed explanation of the\nanalysis as well a library of the spectra for more complete information for\neach of the 60 stars, and further discussions on the implications for the\nstructure of the Galaxy.\n  This region contains a prominent excess in the flux distribution and star\ncounts previously observed in several spectral ranges, notably in the TMGS.\nMore than 50% of the spectra of the stars detected with m_K<5.0 mag, within a\nvery high confidence level, correspond to stars of luminosity class I, and a\nsignificant proportion of the remainder are very late giants which must also be\nrapidly evolving. We make the case, using all the available evidence, that we\nare observing a region at the nearer end of the Galactic bar, where the Scutum\nspiral arm breaks away, and that this is powerful evidence for the presence of\nthe bar. Alternative explanations do not give nearly such a satisfactory\naccount of the observations.\n  The space localization of one and, a fortiori, of both ends of the bar allows\nus to infer a position angle for the bar of around 75 deg. with respect to the\nSun-Galactic centre line. The angle is different from that given by other\nauthors for the bar and this, we think, is because they refer to the triaxial\nbulge and not to the bar as detected here.",

These\ndata reveal a gas-rich, optically faint tidal tail with a length of over 180\nkpc. The size of this tidal feature necessitates an old interaction age for the\nmerger (~750 Myr since first periapse), which is currently experiencing a very\nyoung star burst (~20 Myr). The observations reveal a most remarkable structure\nwithin the tidal tail: it appears to be composed of two parallel filaments\nseparated by ~20 kpc. One of the filaments is gas rich with little if any\nstarlight, while the other is gas poor. We believe that this bifurcation\nresults from a warped disk in one of the progenitors. The quantities and\nkinematics of the tidal HI suggest that Arp 299 results from the collision of a\nretrograde Sab-Sb galaxy (IC 694) and a prograde Sbc-Sc galaxy (NGC 3690) that\noccurred 750 Myr ago and which will merge into a single object in ~60 Myr. We\nsuggest that the present IR luminous phase in this system is due in part to the\nretrograde spin of IC 694. Finally, we discuss the apparent lack of tidal dwarf\ngalaxies within the tail.",

    "summary": "It is well known that a spherically symmetric constant density static star,\nmodeled as a perfect fluid, possesses a bound on its mass m by its radial size\nR given by 2m/R \\le 8/9 and that this bound continues to hold when the energy\ndensity decreases monotonically. The existence of such a bound is intriguing\nbecause it occurs well before the appearance of an apparent horizon at m = R/2.\nHowever, the assumptions made are extremely restrictive. They do not hold in a\nhumble soap bubble and they certainly do not approximate any known\ntopologically stable field configuration. We show that the 8/9 bound is robust\nby relaxing these assumptions. If the density is monotonically decreasing and\nthe tangential stress is less than or equal to the radial stress we show that\nthe 8/9 bound continues to hold through the entire bulk if m is replaced by the\nquasi-local mass. If the tangential stress exceeds the radial stress and/or the\ndensity is not monotonic we cannot recover the 8/9 bound. However, we can show\nthat 2m/R remains strictly bounded away from unity by constructing an explicit\nupper bound which depends only on the ratio of the stresses and the variation\nof the density.",

Although these gravity waves are not directly observable, the energy\ndensity that they contribute grows in importance during the radiation- and\ndust-dominated ages of the universe. We show that the back reaction of tensor\nperturbations during matter domination is limited from above, since\ngravitational waves of wavelength $\\lambda$ have a share of the total energy\ndensity $\\Delta \\rho(\\lambda)/\\rho$ during matter domination that is at most\nequal to the share of the total energy density that they had when the mode\n$\\lambda$ exited the Hubble radius $H^{-1}$ during inflation. This work is to\nbe contrasted to that of Sahni, who analyzed the energy density of gravity\nwaves only insofar as their wavelengths are smaller than $H^{-1}$. Such a\ncut-off in the spectral energy of gravity waves leads to the breakdown of\nenergy conservation, and we show that this anomaly is eliminated simply by\ntaking into account the energy density and pressure of long wavelength\ngravitational waves as well as short wavelength ones.",

At the method's core is a rational mapping of the\nRiemann sphere with the icosahedral symmetry of a general quintic.

This symmetry-breaking provides for a reliable or \"generally-convergent\"\nquintic-solving algorithm: with almost any fifth-degree equation, associate a\nrational mapping that has reliable dynamics and whose attractor consists of\npoints from which one computes a root.\n  An algorithm that solves the sixth-degree equation requires a dynamical\nsystem with the symmetry of the alternating group on six things. This group\ndoes not act on the Riemmann sphere, but does act on the complex projective\nplane--this is the Valentiner group. The present work exploits the resulting\n2-dimensional geometry in finding a Valentiner-symmetric rational mapping whose\nelegant dynamics experimentally appear to be reliable in the above\nsense---transferred to the 2-dimensional setting.

The situation improved dramatically in 1997, when the rapid\navailability of precise coordinates for the bursts allowed the detection of\nfaint optical and radio afterglows - optical spectra thus obtained have\ndemonstrated conclusively that the bursts occur at cosmological distances. But,\ndespite efforts by several groups, optical detection has not hitherto been\nachieved during the brief duration of a burst. Here we report the detection of\nbright optical emission from GRB990123 while the burst was still in progress.\nOur observations begin 22 seconds after the onset of the burst and show an\nincrease in brightness by a factor of 14 during the first 25 seconds; the\nbrightness then declines by a factor of 100, at which point (700 seconds after\nthe burst onset) it falls below our detection threshold. The redshift of this\nburst, approximately 1.6, implies a peak optical luminosity of 5 times 10^{49}\nerg per second. Optical emission from gamma-ray bursts has been generally\nthought to take place at the shock fronts generated by interaction of the\nprimary energy source with the surrounding medium, where the gamma-rays might\nalso be produced. The lack of a significant change in the gamma-ray light curve\nwhen the optical emission develops suggests that the gamma-rays are not\nproduced at the shock front, but closer to the site of the original explosion.",

An\nasymptotic analysis of spiral motion and retraction is carried out in this\nweakly excitable large core regime starting from the free-boundary limit of the\nreaction-diffusion models, valid when the excited region is delimited by a thin\ninterface. The wave description is shown to naturally split between the tip\nregion and a far region that are smoothly matched on an intermediate scale.\nThis separation allows us to rigorously derive an equation of motion for the\nwave tip, with the large scale motion of the spiral wavefront slaved to the\ntip. This kinematic description provides both a physical picture and exact\npredictions for a wide range of wave behavior, including: (i) steady rotation\n(frequency and core radius), (ii) exact treatment of the meandering instability\nin the free-boundary limit with the prediction that the frequency of unstable\nmotion is half the primary steady frequency (iii) drift under external actions\n(external field with application to axisymmetric scroll ring motion in\nthree-dimensions, and spatial or/and time-dependent variation of excitability),\nand (iv) the dynamics of multi-armed spiral waves with the new prediction that\nsteadily rotating waves with two or more arms are linearly unstable. Numerical\nsimulations of FitzHug-Nagumo kinetics are used to test several aspects of our\nresults. In addition, we discuss the semi-quantitative extension of this theory\nto finite cores and pinpoint mathematical subtleties related to the thin\ninterface limit of singly diffusive reaction-diffusion models.",

In the best studied ultraluminous IR galaxy,\nArp 220, the 2 micron imaging shows dust disks in both of the merging galactic\nnuclei and mm-CO line imaging indicates molecular gas masses approx. 10^9 M_sun\nfor each disk. The two gas disks in Arp 220 are counterrotating and their\ndynamical masses are approx. 2x10^9 M_sun, that is, only slightly larger than\nthe gas masses. These disks have radii approx 100 pc and thickness 10-50 pc.\nThe high brightness temperatures of the CO lines indicate that the gas in the\ndisks has area filling factors of approx. 25-50% and mean densities of >~ 10^4\ncm^(-3). Within these nuclear disks, the rate of massive star formation is\nundoubtedly prodigious and, given the high viscosity of the gas, there will\nalso be high radial accretion rates, perhaps >~ 10 M_sun/yr. If this inflow\npersists to very small radii, it is enough to feed even the highest luminosity\nAGNs.",

Uncertainty in the mass distribution\nof the lens is the largest source of uncertainty in the derived H0. We\ninvestigate the range of \\hn produced by a set of lens models intended to mimic\nthe full range of astrophysically plausible mass distributions, using as\nconstraints the numerous multiply-imaged sources which have been detected. We\nobtain the first adequate fit to all the observations, but only if we include\neffects from the galaxy cluster beyond a constant local magnification and\nshear. Both the lens galaxy and the surrounding cluster must depart from\ncircular symmetry as well.\n  Lens models which are consistent with observations to 95% CL indicate\nH0=104^{+31}_{-23}(1-\\kthirty) km/s/Mpc. Previous weak lensing measurements\nconstrain the mean mass density within 30\" of G1 to be kthirty=0.26+/-0.16 (95%\nCL), implying H0=77^{+29}_{-24}km/s/Mpc (95% CL). The best-fitting models span\nthe range 65--80 km/s/Mpc. Further observations will shrink the confidence\ninterval for both the mass model and \\kthirty.\n  The range of H0 allowed by the full gamut of our lens models is substantially\nlarger than that implied by limiting consideration to simple power law density\nprofiles. We therefore caution against use of simple isothermal or power-law\nmass models in the derivation of H0 from other time-delay systems. High-S/N\nimaging of multiple or extended lensed features will greatly reduce the H0\nuncertainties when fitting complex models to time-delay lenses.",

Observationally, the column densities in the nuclear\nregions of ULIRGs are known to be very high, which makes distinguishing\nstarbursts from AGN quite difficult. The level of energy and momentum injection\nmeans that the pressure in the ISM must be extremely high, at least 3-4 orders\nof magnitude larger than in the local ISM or typical giant molecular clouds. It\nalso means that the luminosity of GMCs in ULIRGs must be very high, as they\nmust radiate many times their binding energy over their lifetimes. I briefly\nreview the influence which X-ray irradiation can have on the ISM in AGN-powered\nULIRGs. Finally, I show that the presence of PAH features in ULIRGs does not\nimply that they must be starburst-dominated, since at the column densities and\npressures typical of the ISM in ULIRGs PAHs can survive even at tens of parsec\ndistances from the AGN.",

Evidence\nfor this hypothesis includes long term (117 day, 235 day, 352 day)\nperiodicities seen by the RXTE All Sky Monitor (ASM), which we interpret as\nbeing due to a warped precessing disk, and a 1 keV feature in the ASCA data,\nwhich we interpret as being the blend of L fluorescence features from a disk\natmosphere or wind.

    "summary": "We show that the excess of nitrogen emission observed in a large sample of\nStarburst Nucleus Galaxies (SBNGs) can only be explained at a given metallicity\nby an overabundance of nitrogen with respect to normal HII regions in the disks\nof late-type spirals. The N/O ratios in the SBNGs are comparable to the values\nfound in the bulges of normal early-type spirals, which suggests that what we\nobserve could be the main production of nitrogen in the bulges of these\ngalaxies.\n  The variation of the N/O ratio as a function of metallicity in SBNGs follows\na primary + secondary relation, but the increase of nitrogen does not appear as\na continuous process. In SBNGs, nitrogen is probably produced by different\npopulations of intermediate-mass stars, which were formed during past sequences\nof bursts of star formation. This assumption pushes the origin of the main\nbursts 2-3 Gyrs back in the past. On a cosmological scale, this time interval\ncorresponds to redshifts z = 0.2-0.3, where a significant increase of star\nformation activity occurred. The origin of the SBNG phenomenon would thus have\ncosmological implications, it would be related to a more active phase of star\nformation in the Universe sometime in its recent past.",

One newly\nidentified star is the second ``Luminous Blue Variable'' in the cluster, after\nthe ``Pistol Star.'' Given the evolutionary stages of the identified stars, the\ncluster appears to be about 4 \\pm 1 Myr old, assuming coeval formation. The\ntotal mass in observed stars is $\\sim 10^3 \\Msun$, and the implied mass is\n$\\sim 10^4 \\Msun$, assuming a lower mass cutoff of 1 \\Msun and a Salpeter\ninitial mass function. The implied mass density in stars is at least a few\nthousand $\\Msun pc^{-3}$. The newly-identified stars increase the estimated\nionizing flux from this cluster by about an order of magnitude with respect to\nearlier estimates, to 10^{50.9} photons/s, or roughly what is required to\nionize the nearby ``Sickle'' HII region (G0.18 - 0.04). The total luminosity\nfrom the massive cluster stars is $\\approx 10^{7.5}$ \\Lsun, enough to account\nfor the heating of the nearby molecular cloud, M0.20 - 0.033. We propose a\npicture which integrates most of the major features in this part of the sky,\nexcepting the non-thermal filaments. We compare the cluster to other young\nmassive clusters and globular clusters, finding that it is unique in stellar\ncontent and age, except, perhaps, for the young cluster in the central parsec\nof the Galaxy.

The advent of\nsensitive receivers on large radio telescopes such as the JCMT and IRAM 30m MRT\nhas led to the identification of young protostars at the beginning of the main\naccretion phase (`Class 0' objects), and has made it possible to probe, for the\nfirst time, the inner density structure of pre-collapse cores. Class 0 objects\nare characterized by strong, centrally-condensed dust continuum emission at\nsubmillimeter wavelengths, very little emission shortward of 10 microns, and\npowerful jet-like outflows. Direct evidence for gravitational infall has been\nobserved toward several of them. They are interpreted as accreting protostars\nwhich have not yet accumulated the majority of their final stellar mass.

We extend our study in three main directions which allow us\nto make closer contact with real bistable systems. These are i) a detailed\nanalysis of two dimensions, ii) the case of competing agents, and iii) the\ncases of asymmetric and quenched random couplings. Most of our results are\nobtained by extending our original phenomenological model, and are supported by\nextensive numerical simulations.",

    "summary": "Electron scattering induces a polarization in the cosmic microwave background\n(CMB) signal measured in the direction of a galaxy cluster due to the presence\nof a quadrupole component in the CMB temperature distribution. Measuring the\npolarization towards distant clusters provides the unique opportunity to\nobserve the evolution of the CMB quadrupole at moderate redshifts, z~0.5-3. We\ndemonstrate that for the local cluster population the polarization degree will\ndepend on the cluster celestial position. There are two extended regions in the\nsky, which are opposite to each other, where the polarization is maximal,\n0.1(tau/0.02) microK in the Rayleigh-Jeans part of the CMB spectrum (tau being\nthe Thomson optical depth across the cluster) exceeding the contribution from\nthe cluster transverse peculiar motion if v_t<1300 km/s. One can hope to detect\nthis small signal by measuring a large number of clusters, thereby effectively\nremoving the systematic contribution from other polarization components\nproduced in clusters. These polarization effects, which are of the order of\n(v_t/c)^2 tau, (v_t/c) tau^2 and (kT_e/m_ec^2) tau^2, as well as the\npolarization due to the CMB quadrupole, were previously calculated by Sunyaev\nand Zel'dovich for the Rayleigh-Jeans region. We fully confirm their earlier\nresults and present exact frequency dependencies for all these effects. The\npolarization is considerably higher in the Wien region of the CMB spectrum.",

We are able to catalogue the relaxed nonlinear force-free\nequilibria resulting from the application of deformations to an initially\nundisturbed region of plasma containing a uniform, vertical magnetic field. The\ndeformations are manifested by imposing motions on the bounding planes to which\nthe magnetic field is anchored. Once imposed the new distribution of magnetic\nfootpoints are then taken to be fixed, so that the rest of the plasma must then\nrelax to a new equilibrium configuration. For the class of footpoint motions we\nhave examined, we find that singular and nonsingular equilibria can be\ngenerated. By singular we mean that within the limits imposed by numerical\nresolution we find that there is no convergence to a well-defined equilibrium\nas the number of grid points in the numerical domain is increased. These\nsingular equilibria contain current \"sheets\" of ever-increasing current\nintensity and decreasing width; they occur when the footpoint motions exceed a\ncertain threshold, and must include both twist and shear to be effective. On\nthe basis of these results we contend that flux braiding will indeed result in\nsignificant current generation. We discuss the implications of our results for\ncoronal heating.",

We show\nthat the timescale for the BZ process to exhaust the rotational energy of the\nhole spans many gigayears in all such sources. We compute scales long and\nuniform enough to yield an intrinsically slow population evolution, giving rise\nto number counts of ``Euclidean'' or flatter shape; even longer timescales\napply to the additional, analogous process involving the inner accretion disk\ndirectly. Such slow evolution takes place in ambients and at epochs (z \\lsim 1)\nwhere interactions of the host galaxies with companions become rare or weak. On\nthe other hand, at higher z, we argue that frequent interactions of the hosts\nwithin groups enhanced, each for some 10^{-1} Gyr, the accretion rates and the\nemissions from the disks, attaining power levels that are typical of the\nradio-loud quasars. But such interactions were also likely to disorder the\nlarge-scale magnetic field in the disk and to decrease angular momentum of the\nhole, thus limiting the lifetime of all BZ emissions to under a few gigayears.\nThen the stronger evolution of the flat-spectrum radio-loud quasars was driven,\nsimilar to the radio-quiet ones, by the interaction rate decreasing rapidly\nwith z.",

Paper I did not treat the\npolarization of this scattered radiation, but did suggest that the degree of\nsuch polarization might be large. In this Letter we report on improved\ncalculations for these \\lya halos, now accounting for the polarization of the\nradiation field. The polarization is linear and is oriented tangentially to the\nprojected displacement from the center of the source. The degree of\npolarization is found to be 14% at the core radius, where the intensity has\nfallen to half of the central value. It rises to 32% and 45% at the radii where\nthe intensity has fallen to one-tenth and one-hundreth of the central\nintensity, respectively. At larger radii the degree of polarization rises\nfurther, asymptotically to 60%.

However, in a decidedly\nnon-statistical approach allowed by the wide-area coverage and large number of\nredshifts they measured in A3266, Quintana, Ramirez, and Way (1996; QRW) sliced\nthe real cluster in redshift space to uncover a peculiar spatial distribution\nof galaxies that they suggested was the result of a recent merger. In our\nsimulations, a similar distribution is the result of an ongoing merger between\ntwo comparable-mass units that started about 2x10^9 years ago in the N-body\nsimulations. We also find that the distribution of emission line galaxies in\nA3266 traces the same structure. We discuss further tests of our merger\nhypothesis, and speculate on the possibility that a similar process might be\noccurring in other, apparently-relaxed clusters at the present epoch.",

The spectroscopic sample is\ncorrected for incompleteness and used to estimate the 1.4 GHz and H\\alpha\nluminosity functions (LFs) and luminosity density distributions. The 1.4 GHz LF\nof the star-forming population has a much steeper faint-end slope (1.85) than\nthat for the ellipticals (1.35). This implies an increasing preponderance of\nstar-forming galaxies among the optically identified (i.e., z < 1) radio\nsources at fainter flux densities. The H\\alpha LF of the faint radio population\nagrees with published H\\alpha LFs derived from local samples selected by\nH\\alpha emission. This suggests that the star-forming faint radio population is\ncoincident with the H\\alpha selected galaxies. The 1.4 GHz and H\\alpha\nluminosity densities have been used to estimate the SFRs.

While these objects are slightly lower in luminosity than other EMSS\nBL Lacs, their properties are too similar to the other BL Lacs in the EMSS\nsample to \"bridge the gap\" between BL Lacs and FR-1 radio galaxies. Also, the\nnumber of new BL Lacs found are too few to alter significantly the X-ray\nluminosity function or <v/vmax> value for the X-ray-selected EMSS BL Lac\nsample.

It is assumed (through the equation of state)\nthat a relativistic early universe is followed by a matter-dominated late\nuniverse. The action is used in a saddlepoint approximation to a semiclassical\nestimate for the wave function in quantum cosmology to explain why our inertial\nframe seems not to rotate relative to the stars. The saddlepoint is at b=0, as\nwould be expected. Application of the saddlepoint approximation leads to the\nresult that only those classical geometries whose action differs from the\nsaddlepoint value for the action by an amount less than Planck's constant\ncontribute significantly to the integration to give the present value of the\nwave function. Using estimates for our universe implies that only those\nclassical geometries for which the present relative rotation rate of inertial\nframes and matter are less than about 10^(-130) radians per year contribute\nsignificantly to the integration.

For an assumed LG age of 14 \\pm 2 Gyr, the radius\nof an idealized LG zero-velocity surface is r_0 = 1.18 \\pm 0.15 Mpc. The Local\nGroup is found to have 35 likely members. Only three of those have (uncertain)\ndistances \\grtapr 1.0 Mpc from the LG barycenter. Barring new discoveries of\nlow surface brightness dwarfs, this suggests that the Local Group is more\ncompact, and isolated from its surroundings, than previously believed.",

The SCUBA Deep Survey\n(Hughes et al., 1998) provides an upper limit of the 850 micron flux densities\nof the LBGs. With this constraint, we argue that a typical ultra-violet to\nfar-infrared spectral shape of the high-redshift LBGs is rather close to a\ntemplate spectrum of low-reddening starburst galaxies in the local universe but\ndifferent from that of heavily dust-enshrouded ultra-luminous far-infrared\ngalaxies like Arp220. We also evaluate the lower-limit temperature of dust in\nLBGs assuming single- and two-component modified black-body spectrum. To\nestimate the total amount of energy re-emitted in FIR wavelength, we take two\ndifferent approaches; model fitting of the UV spectra of LBGs and an empirical\nmethod using the relationship between UV spectral shape and UV/FIR flux ratio\nobserved for local starburst galaxies. Both methods give lower-limit\ntemperature of the LBGs as around 40 K, which is higher than the typical dust\ntemperature of local optical- and infrared-selected galaxies. This result is\nalso supported by the comparison of the expected sub-mm flux of the LBGs with\nthe cosmic FIR background radiation. The high dust temperature may indicate the\neffective massive-star formation or different dust properties in the\nhigh-redshift LBGs.",

Varying the frequency ratio $f_{pm}/f_{pr}$ from 0.5 to 100, and\nthe current amplitude of the probe signal from 0.01 to 0.9 of $I_c$, we found\nthat the dependence of the junction impedance at the frequency $f_{pr}$,\n$Z_s^{f_{pr}}$, versus $I_{pm}$ preserves its general features, independent of\n$f_{pm}/f_{pr}$ and $I_{pr}/I_c$ values. At the same time, some particular\nfeatures, like negative values of $Re(Z_s^{f_{pr}})$ and \"fine\" structure of\nthe steps in $Z_s^{f_{pr}}(I_{pm})$ are observed for $f_{pm}/f_{pr}<1$ and for\nparticular values of $I_{pr}/I_c$. In general, the behavior of\n$Z_s^{f_{pr}}(I_{pm})$ is rather different from that predicted by the nonlinear\nRSJ model for a short JJ in the regime of single-frequency irradiation, when\none and the same signal plays the roles of the pump and the probe signals\nsimultaneously.

Overall two-component\nspectral shape is an attribute of Very High state (VHS) observed previously in\nBHC, but the domination of hard component is unusual. Later on, as the X-ray\nsource faded, its energy spectrum qualitatively changed, showing High (HS) and\nthen Low (LS) states, both typical for black hole binaries. As the energy\nspectrum changed, the fast variability also evolved dramatically. Initially the\npower density spectrum was formed by a dominating band-limited noise component,\nQPO features at 20-30 Hz and at ~0.5 Hz, and a very low frequency noise\ncomponent. After a significant decrease of the contribution of the hard\nspectral component the amplitude of the fractional variability decreased by an\norder of magnitude and the PDS spectrum adopted a power-law shape with a broad\nQPO peak around 0.03 Hz. When the system switched to the LS, the PDS shape\nchanged again and the QPOs have not been detected since. When the source was\nobserved in VHS, a clear correlation between QPO parameters and X-ray flux was\nseen.",

After reviewing tests of statistics for various particles, and\ntypes of statistics that are neither Bose nor Fermi, I discuss quons, particles\ncharacterized by the parameter $q$, which permit a smooth interpolation between\nBose and Fermi statistics; $q=1$ gives bosons, $q=-1$ gives fermions. The new\nresult of this talk is work by Robert C. Hilborn and myself that gives a\nheuristic argument for an extension of conservation of statistics to quons with\ntrilinear couplings of the form $\\bar{f}fb$, where $f$ is fermion-like and $b$\nis boson-like. We showed that $q_f^2=q_b$. In particular, we related the bound\non $q_{\\gamma}$ for photons to the bound on $q_e$ for electrons, allowing the\nvery precise bound for electrons to be carried over to photons. An extension of\nour argument suggests that all particles are fermions or bosons to high\nprecision.",

For the case where the target metric on $G/H$ is induced\nfrom the invariant metric on $G$, the dual system is a gauged Higgs model, with\na nonconstant metric and a coupling to an antisymmetric tensor. The dynamics\nfor the gauge connection is governed by a $BF$-term. Lie-Poisson duality is\nrelevant once we allow for a more general class of target metrics, as well as\nfor couplings to an antisymmetric tensor, in the primary theory. Then the dual\ntheory is written on a group $\\tilde G$ dual to $G$, and the gauge group $H$\n(which, in general, is not a subgroup of $\\tilde G$) acts nonlinearly on\n$\\tilde G$. The dual system therefore gives a nonlinear realization of a gauge\ntheory.

Couplings between them are then suppressed due to the exponentially small\noverlaps of their wave functions. This provides a framework for understanding\nboth the fermion mass hierarchy and proton stability without imposing\nsymmetries, but rather in terms of higher dimensional geography. A model\nindependent prediction of this scenario is non-universal couplings of the\nStandard Model fermions to the ``Kaluza-Klein'' excitations of the gauge\nfields.

We suppose the core luminosity is generated as a result of planetesimal\naccretion and calculate the structure of the gaseous envelope assuming\nequilibrium. This is a good approximation when the core mass is less than the\ncritical value, M_{crit}, above which rapid gas accretion begins. We model the\nstructure of the protoplanetary nebula as an accretion disk with constant\n\\alpha. We present analytic fits for the steady state relation between disk\nsurface density and mass accretion rate as a function of radius r. We calculate\nM_{crit} as a function of r, gas accretion rate through the disk, and\nplanetesimal accretion rate onto the core \\dot{M}. For a fixed \\dot{M},\nM_{crit} increases inwards, and it decreases with \\dot{M}. We find that \\dot{M}\nonto cores migrating inwards in a time 10^3-10^5 yr at 1 AU is sufficient to\nprevent the attainment of M_{crit} during the migration process. Only at small\nradii where planetesimals no longer exist can M_{crit} be attained. At small\nradii, the runaway gas accretion phase may become longer than the disk lifetime\nif the core mass is too small. However, massive cores can be built-up through\nthe merger of additional incoming cores on a timescale shorter than for in situ\nformation. Therefore, feeding zone depletion in the neighborhood of a fixed\norbit may be avoided. Accordingly, we suggest that giant planets may begin to\nform early in the life of the protostellar disk at small radii, on a timescale\nthat may be significantly shorter than for in situ formation.

To derive the macroscopic order parameter equations for the\nnetwork with an extensive number of stored patterns, we introduce the effective\ntransfer function by assuming the fixed-point equation of the form of the TAP\nequation, which describes the time-averaged output as a function of the\neffective time-averaged local field. Properties of the networks associated with\nsynchronization phenomena for a discrete symmetric natural frequency\ndistribution with three frequency components are studied based on the order\nparameter equations, and are shown to be in good agreement with the results of\nnumerical simulations. Two types of retrieval states are found to occur with\nrespect to the degree of synchronization, when the size of the width of the\nnatural frequency distribution is changed.",

This yields a lower limit to the mean magnetic\nfield of 0.36 micro Gauss (uG) and an upperlimit of 1.8x10^-13 ergs/cm^3 for\nthe cosmic-ray electron energy density. The resulting lower limit to the\ncentral magnetic field is ~1 - 3 uG While a magnetic field of ~0.1 - 0.2 uG can\nbe created by galaxy wakes, a magnetic field of several uG is usually\nassociated with a cooling flow or, as in the case of the Coma cluster, a\nsubcluster merger.
