This Letter presents some of\nthe newly discovered correlations of the globular cluster specific frequency\n$S_N$ in these galaxies with other galaxy and cluster properties and puts forth\nan interpretation of these results. $S_N$ is found to correlate strongly with\nmeasures of the cluster density, such as the velocity dispersion of the cluster\ngalaxies and the cluster X-ray temperature and luminosity (especially ``local''\nX-ray luminosity). Within a cluster, galaxies at smaller projected distances\nfrom the X-ray center are found to have higher values of $S_N$. Taken together,\nthe scaling of $S_N$ with cluster density and the relative constancy of central\ngalaxy luminosity suggest a scenario in which globular clusters form in\nproportionate numbers to the available mass, but galaxy luminosity\n``saturates'' at a maximum threshold, resulting in higher \\sn\\ values for\ncentral galaxies in denser clusters as well as the suitability of these\ngalaxies as ``standard candles.''

The orthogonality catastrophe makes the physics of\nsuperconductivity drastically different from the BCS-theory but similar to the\nphysics of one-dimensional electronic liquids. The wave function of a pair is\ndressed by soft modes.

I first apply it to the non-interacting field, obtaining an\nexpression for the effective potential which is formally coincident with the\nwell-known one from the first method. My approach, however, seems here\nmathematically more rigorous since it excludes the presence of the\nmultiplicative anomaly. I then obtain a new expression for the one loop\neffective potential for the interacting field. This is regularised, presents\nless cryptic excitation energies, shows Goldstone excitations, and in the\nnon-interacting limit gives the expected expression.

Here we use the currently available ASCA data to\nsystematically compare the harder (\\approx 2--10 keV) X-ray continua of soft\nROSAT narrow-line Seyfert 1s with those of Seyfert 1s with larger H-beta FWHM.\nOur robust and nonparametric testing suggests, with high statistical\nsignificance, that soft ROSAT narrow-line Seyfert 1s have generally steeper\nintrinsic hard X-ray continua than Seyfert 1s with larger H-beta FWHM. The hard\nphoton index trend appears similar to the previously known soft photon index\ntrend, although with a reduced photon index spread. If the soft X-ray excesses\nof all Seyfert 1s are confined to below \\approx 1 keV they cannot directly\naffect the \\approx 2--10 keV spectra studied here. However, as suggested for\nthe extreme narrow-line Seyfert 1 RE J 1034+393, a strong soft X-ray excess may\naffect the accretion disc corona which creates the underlying hard X-ray power\nlaw. If this is occurring, then more detailed study of this physical process\ncould give clues about the formation of the underlying continua of all\nSeyferts.

The paper is devoted to the\nrepresentation theory of the gl(lambda). The Shapovalov's form determinant is\ncalculated; it depends polynomially on lambda and the parameters of the\nrepresentation. It is natural to include the Hamiltonian Lie algebra of\nfunctions on the hyperboloid to the range of gl(lambda), relating it to the\nvalue lambda = infinity. Thus, every family of representations of gl(lambda)\ndepending holomorphically on lambda is associated with a holomorphic vector\nbundle on the Riemann sphere. The determinant of the Shapovalov's form thus\ndetermines the corresponding line bundle. The Chern class of this bundle is\ncalculated in two different ways (for every level on the representation). The\ncomparison of the two formulas yields new combinatorial identities with power\nseries.\n  The results of Chapter 1 about the Lie algebra gl(inf) may have some\nindependent interest.",

The jet is precessed at\nthe origin to excite Kelvin-Helmholtz unstable helical modes. We extensively\ncompare the structure in these simulations with linear stability theory. The\njet that is dense with respect to the external medium develops a high speed\ncore surrounded by a less dense sheath consisting of slower moving jet fluid.\nThese simulations suggest that extended extragalactic jets propagate to such\nlarge distances because they are surrounded by a lobe or cocoon whose density\nis less than the jet density.

The first part describes classical solutions of 11d\nsupergravity which upon dimensional reduction and T-dualities give bound states\nof NS-NS and R-R p-branes of type IIA and IIB string theories. In some cases\n(e.g. (q_1,q_2) string bound states of type IIB string theory), these\nnon-perturbative objects admit a simple eleven-dimensional description in terms\nof a fundamental 2-brane. The BPS excitations of such 2-brane are calculated\nand shown to exactly match the mass spectrum for the BPS (q_1,q_2) string bound\nstates. Different 11d representations of the same bound state can be used to\nprovide inequivalent (T-dual) descriptions of the oscillating BPS states. This\npermits to test T-duality beyond perturbation theory and, in certain cases, to\nevade membrane instabilities by going to a stable T-dual representation.

Monochromatic\nadiabatic waves, due to unbalanced heating, generate continuously rising\nchromospheric temperature plateaus in which the low frequency resonances\nquickly die out. All non-adiabatic calculations lead to stable mean\nchromospheric temperature distributions determined by shock dissipation and\nradiative cooling. For non-adiabatic monochromatic wave excitation, a critical\nfrequency f_cr ~ 1/25 Hz is confirmed, which separates domains of different\nresonance behaviour. For waves of frequency f < f_cr, the resonances decay,\nwhile for waves of f > f_cr persistent resonance oscillations occur, which are\nperpetuated by shock merging. Excitation with acoustic frequency spectra\nproduces distinct dynamical mean chromosphere models where the detailed\ntemperature distributions depend on the shape of the assumed spectra. The\nstochasticity of the spectra and the ongoing shock merging lead to a persistent\nresonance behaviour of the atmosphere. The acoustic spectra show a distinct\nshape evolution with height such that at great height a pure 3 min band becomes\nincreasingly dominant.

Starting from the Grassmannian action\nfor interacting fermions, we first bosonize the theory by introducing composite\nmatrix variables that correspond to two-fermion excitations and integrating out\nthe fermion degrees of freedom. The saddle point solution of the resulting\nmatrix field theory reproduces a disordered Hartree-Fock approximation and an\nexpansion to Gaussian order about the saddle point corresponds to a disordered\nRPA-like theory. In the clean limit they reduce to the ordinary Hartree-Fock\nand random-phase approximations. We first concentrate on disordered systems,\nand perform a symmetry analysis that allows for a systematic separation of the\nmassless modes from the massive ones. By treating the massive modes in a simple\napproximation, one obtains a technically satisfactory derivation of the\ngeneralized nonlinear sigma-model that has been used in the theory of\nmetal-insulator transitions. The theory also allows for the treatment of other\nphase transitions in the disordered Fermi liquid. We further use\nrenormalization group techniques to establish the existence of a disordered\nFermi-liquid fixed point, and show that it is stable for all dimensions d>2.\nThe so-called weak-localization effects can be understood as corrections to\nscaling near this fixed point. The general theory also allows for studying the\nclean limit. For that case we develop a loop expansion that corresponds to an\nexpansion in powers of the screened Coulomb interaction, and that represents a\nsystematic improvement over RPA. We corroborate the existence of a Fermi-liquid\nfixed point that is stable for all dimensions d>1, in agreement with other\nrecent field-theoretical treatments of clean Fermi liquids.",

More massive and/or\nroughly spherical systems reach the threshold-metallicity for a transition to a\nmulti-phase interstellar medium earlier than less massive, more flattened\nsystems. Therefore, more flattened, lower-mass systems start to form stars\nactively at smaller redshifts. A natural explanation is found in the overall\nrobustness of the interstellar medium against complete expulsion (blow-away) at\nhigh total masses, and in the prevention of metal enrichment in the outer\nregions due to axial outflow along the symmetry axis of a non-spherical\nproto-galaxy (blow-out). We suggest that the observed predominance of\nspheroidal systems observed at high redshift, e.g. in the Hubble Deep Field, is\ndue to this effect: At z>2, roundish (proto-)galaxies with total\n(dark+baryonic) masses of ~10^11 M_o and/or the inner spheroidal cores of\nsimilarly massive flattened systems sustain a multi-phase interstellar medium,\nand therefore a high star-formation rate, whose magnitude depends on the\nfraction of baryonic matter in the systems. Conversely, the peak at z~1-2 in\nthe observed cosmological metal production rate coincides with the epochs of\nstar formation of lower mass spheroidals, as well as of massive proto-galactic\ndisks.",

We discuss the dependence of this possible difference in multiplicity\non the center-of-mass energy, on the hadron momenta, and on the angular\nseparation between the $W^{\\pm}$ dijets. If it were observed, any such\nmultiplicity difference would indicate that the W's do not hadronize\nindependently, and hence raise questions about the accuracy with which the W\nmass could be determined from purely hadronic final states.",

    "summary": "The action for a relativistic free particle of mass m receives a contribution\n$-m R(x,y)$ from a path of length R(x,y) connecting the events $x^i$ and $y^i$.\nUsing this action in a path integral, one can obtain the Feynman propagator for\na spinless particle of mass m in any background spacetime. If one of the\neffects of quantizing gravity is to introduce a minimum length scale $L_P$ in\nthe spacetime, then one would expect the segments of paths with lengths less\nthan $L_P$ to be suppressed in the path integral. Assuming that the path\nintegral amplitude is invariant under the `duality' transformation ${\\cal R}\\to\nL_P^2/R$, one can calculate the modified Feynman propagator in an arbitrary\nbackground spacetime. It turns out that the key feature of this modification is\nthe following: The proper distance $(\\Delta x)^2$ between two events, which are\ninfinitesimally separated, is replaced by $\\Delta x^2 + L_P^2$; that is the\nspacetime behaves as though it has a `zero-point length' of $L_P$. This\nequivalence suggests a deep relationship between introducing a\n`zero-point-length' to the spacetime and postulating invariance of path\nintegral amplitudes under duality transformations. In the Schwinger's proper\ntime description of the propagator, the weightage for a path with proper time s\nbecomes $m(s+L_P^2/s)$ rather than as ms. As to be expected, the ultraviolet\nbehavior of the theory is improved significantly and divergences will disappear\nif this modification is taken into account.

The uncertainty in the extraction of the\nweak phase $\\alpha$ from the measurement of the time-dependent asymmetry in\n$B^0_d \\to \\pi^+ \\pi^-$ decays is also analyzed. We find that, among several\neffects which may enhance the $B^0_d \\to \\pi^0 \\pi^0$ branching ratio, the most\nimportant is due to ``charming penguin\" diagrams that have never been studied\nbefore. These diagrams easily increase $BR(B^0_d \\to \\pi^0 \\pi^0)$ up to a\nvalue of $1-3 \\times 10^{-6}$. The same effect produces, however, a large error\nin the extraction of $\\alpha$ from the measurement of the $B^0_d \\to \\pi^+\n\\pi^-$ time-dependent asymmetry. We show that it is possible to determine\ncharming-penguin amplitudes from the experimental measurement of many decay\nrates. Their effect is impressive in $B^+ \\to \\pi^+ K^0$ and $B^0_d \\to K^+\n\\pi^-$ decays, where charming-penguin contributions easily give values of\n$BR(B^+ \\to \\pi^+ K^0)$ and $BR(B^0_d \\to K^+ \\pi^-)$ of about $1 \\times\n10^{-5}$.

IRAS 13224-3809\nappears to be the most X-ray variable Seyfert known, and its variability is\nprobably nonlinear. We carefully check the identification of the highly\nvariable X-ray source with the distant galaxy, and it appears to be secure. We\nexamine possible explanations for the giant variability. Unusually strong\nrelativistic effects and partial covering by occulting structures on an\naccretion disc can provide plausible explanations of the X-ray data, and we\nexplore these two scenarios. Relativistic boosting effects may be relevant to\nunderstanding the strong X-ray variability of some steep spectrum Seyferts more\ngenerally.",

The inertial\nforces in auniformly rotating system are calculated, which show that the\nCoriolis force is produced by a magnetic-type gravitational field. We have also\ncalculated the Sagnac effect due to the rotation. These experimental facts\nstrongly support our proposed coordinate conditions. In addition, the\ngravitodynamic field equations are briefly discussed.

In\nparticular, such measurements allow to distinguish the effects of frequency\nanisotropy and of gain-loss anisotropy and would provide data on the spin\nrelaxation rate in the quantum well structure during cw operation as well as\nrepresenting a new way of experimentally determinig the linewidth enhancement\nfactor alpha.",

Consideration of planar and non-planar diagrams\nsuggests that the large N perturbative expansion is consistent with the double\nscaling limit proposed by the above authors. We write down a Wilson loop that\ncan be interpreted as a fundamental string vertex operator. The one point\ntadpole in the presence of a D-string has the right form and this can be viewed\nas a matrix model derivation of the boundary conditions that define a D-string.\nWe also argue that if world sheet coordinates $\\sigma$ and $\\tau$ are\nintroduced for the fundamental string, then the conjugate variable\n${d}/{d\\sigma}$ and ${d}/{d\\tau}$ can be interpreted as the D-string world\nsheet coordinates. In this way the $SL(2Z)$ duality group of the IIB\nsuperstring becomes identified with the symplectic group acting on ($p,q$).",

For weak disorder (metallic regime), the energy dependence of the\nphase shifts of $S$ is found to yield the same universal parametric\ncorrelations as those characterizing chaotic Hamiltonian eigenvalues driven by\nan external parameter. This is analyzed within a Brownian-motion model for $S$,\nwhich is directly related to the distribution of the Wigner-Smith delay time\nmatrix. For large disorder (localized regime), transport is dominated by\nresonant tunneling and the universal behavior disappears. A model based on a\nsimplified description of the localized wave functions qualitatively explains\nour numerical results. In the insulator, the parametric correlation of the\nphase shift velocities follows the energy-dependent autocorrelator of the\nWigner time. The Wigner time and the conductance are correlated in the metal\nand in the insulator.",

    "summary": "We consider new objects in bosonic open string theory -- ND tadpoles, which\nhave N(euman) boundary conditions at one end of the world-sheet and D(irichlet)\nat the other, must exist due to s-t duality in a string theory with both NN\nstrings and D-branes. We demonstrate how to interpolate between N and D\nboundary conditions. In the case of mixed boundary conditions the action for a\nquantum particle is induced on the boundary. Quantum-mechanical particle-wave\nduality, a dual description of a quantum particle in either the coordinate or\nthe momentum representation, is induced by world-sheet T-duality. The famous\nrelation between compactification radii is equivalent to the quantization of\nthe phase space area of a Planck cell. We also introduce a boundary operator -\na ``Zipper'' which changes the boundary condition from N into D and vice versa.",

The morphology of the H-alpha emission is\nsimilar to that of the 100 um emission previously observed by the Infrared\nAstronomical Satellite (IRAS).

Several\nauthors (notably Lewin et al.) have suggested that the bursts from GRO J1744-28\nare type II bursts (which arise from the sudden release of gravitational\npotential energy). In this paper, we present another similarity between these\nsources. Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer observations of GRO J1744-28 show that at\nleast 10 out of 94 bursts are followed by quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO)\nwith frequencies of about 0.4 Hz. The period of the oscillations decreases over\ntheir 30--80 s lifetime, and they occur during a spectrally hard ``shoulder''\n(or ``plateau'') which follows the burst. In one case the QPO show a modulation\nenvelope which resembles simple beating between two narrow-band oscillations at\n0.325 and 0.375 Hz. Using EXOSAT observations, Lubin et al. found QPO with\nfrequencies of 0.039 to 0.056 Hz following 10 out of 95 type II bursts from the\nRapid Burster. As in GRO J1744-28, the period of these oscillations decreased\nover their 100 s lifetime, and they occurred only during spectrally hard\n``humps'' in the persistent emission. Even though the QPO frequencies differ by\na factor of 10, we believe that this is further evidence that a similar\naccretion disk instability is responsible for the type II bursts from these two\nsources.",

In this scenario all ordinary, Li poor, K giants become Li rich\nduring a short time ($\\sim 10^5 yr$) when compared to the red giant phase of 5\n10^7 yr. In this ``Li period'', a large part of the stars are associated with\nan expanding thin circumstellar shell supposedly triggered by an abrupt\ninternal mixing mechanism resulting in a surface new ^7Li enrichment. This\nletter presents near 40 Li rich K giants known up to now. The distribution of\nthese Li rich giants, along with other 41 observed K giants that have shell,\nbut are not Li rich, in a color-color IRAS diagram confirms this scenario,\nindicating, also as a new result, that a rapid Li depletion takes place on a\ntime scale of between $\\sim 10^3$ and 10^5 yr.

This analysis requires a calculation of the probability that a\nline, if present, will be detected in a given burst. However, the connection\nbetween the detectability of a line in a spectrum and in a burst requires a\nmodel for the occurrence of a line within a burst. We have developed the\nnecessary weighting for the line detection probability for each spectrum\nspanning the burst. The resulting calculations require a description of each\nspectrum in the BATSE database. With these tools we identify the bursts in\nwhich lines are most likely to be detected. Also, by assuming a small frequency\nwith which lines occur, we calculate the approximate number of BATSE bursts in\nwhich lines of various types could be detected. Lines similar to the Ginga\ndetections can be detected in relatively few BATSE bursts; for example, in only\n~20 bursts are lines similar to the GB 880205 pair of lines detectable. Ginga\nreported lines at ~20 and ~40 keV whereas the low energy cutoff of the BATSE\nspectra is typically above 20 keV; hence BATSE's sensitivity to lines is less\nthan that of Ginga below 40 keV, and greater above. Therefore the probability\nthat the GB 880205 lines would be detected in a Ginga burst rather than a BATSE\nburst is ~0.2.

We discuss the possibilities\nof new effective interactions and the production of a narrow state of mass 200\nGeV with leptoquark couplings. We compare these models with the measured Q^2\ndistributions: for the contact terms, constraints from LEP2 and the Tevatron\nallow only a few choices of helicity and flavour structure that could roughly\nfit the HERA data. The data are instead quite consistent with the Q^2\ndistribution expected from a leptoquark state. We study the production cross\nsections of such a particle at the Tevatron and at HERA. The absence of a\nsignal at the Tevatron disfavours the likelihood that any such leptoquark\ndecays only into e^+ q. We then focus on the possibility that the leptoquark is\na squark with R-violating couplings. In view of the present experimental limits\non such couplings, the most likely production channels are e^+d -> scharm_L or\nperhaps e^+d->stop, with e^+s->stop a more marginal possibility. Possible tests\nof our preferred model include the absence both of analogous events in e^- p\ncollisions and of charged current events, and the presence of detectable\ncascade decays whose kinematical signatures we discuss. We also discuss the\npossible implications for K->pi nu nubar, neutrinoless double-beta decay, the\nTevatron and for e^+ e^- ->q qbar and neutralinos at LEP2.",

S1040 is a single-lined\nspectroscopic binary with a 42.8d period that occupies a \"red straggler\"\nposition in the M67 color-magnitude diagram (CMD), 0.2 mag blueward of the\ngiant branch. A detection of S1040 at 1620 A with the Ultraviolet Imaging\nTelescope provided evidence that the secondary is a hot white dwarf, and thus\nthat the anomalous location of S1040 in the CMD is likely due to a prior\nepisode of mass-transfer. Our GHRS spectrum shows a broad Ly alpha absorption\nprofile that confirms the white dwarf identification of the S1040 secondary. A\nmodel atmosphere fit to the GHRS spectrum yields Teff = 16,160 K, log g = 6.7,\nand a mass of 0.22 Msun, for an assumed cluster distance of 820 pc and\nreddening of E(B-V) = 0.02. The unusually low mass derived for the white dwarf\nimplies that it must have a helium core, and that a mass-transfer episode must\nhave begun while the progenitor was on the lower giant branch. We construct a\nplausible mass-transfer history for S1040 in which it originated as a short\n(~2d) period binary, and evolved through a blue straggler phase to reach its\ncurrent state.",

    "summary": "The cosmic microwave background (CMB) comprises the oldest photons in the\nuniverse and is arguably our most direct cosmological observable. All precise\nand accurate measurements of its attributes serve to distinguish between\ncosmological models. Detector technology and observing techniques have advanced\nto the point where fluctuations in the CMB of order a few microkelvin are\nmeasured almost routinely. In these lecture notes, we review recent\nmeasurements of both the absolute temperature and the anisotropy of the CMB and\ndiscuss the relation between the data and the general theoretical framework.\nFuture directions are indicated and the upcoming satellite experiments are\ndiscussed.",

It has recently been shown that these fluctuations give rise to a\nnew mode of energy transfer between neutrinos and nucleons which inside the\nneutrinosphere is of comparable or greater importance than ordinary recoil. We\ncalculate numerically the spin density structure function in the limit of a\ndilute, non-degenerate medium from exact two-nucleon wave functions for some\nrepresentative nuclear interaction potentials. We show that spectrum and\nmagnitude of the energy transfer can deviate significantly from those based on\nthe Born approximation. They are, however, rather insensitive to the particular\nnuclear potential as long as it reproduces experimental nucleon scattering\nphase shifts at energies up to a few tens of MeV. We also compare with\ncalculations based on a one-pion exchange potential in Born approximation and\nbriefly comment on their applicability near the center of a supernova core. Our\nstudy is relevant for numerical simulations of the neutrino spectra emerging\nfrom type-II supernovae.",

We derive homogeneous distance, extinction and uncertainty\nestimates for four models, starting from the standard extragalactic method and\nthen adding the physical effects of temperature distributions, extinction\ndistributions, requiring positive definite extinctions, and metallicity. While\nwe find general agreement with published distances when we make similar\nsystematic assumptions, there is a clear problem in the standard distances\nbecause they require Cepheids with negative extinctions, particularly in low\nmetallicity galaxies, unless the mean LMC extinction exceeds E(B-V) > 0.25. The\nproblem can be explained by the physically expected metallicity dependence of\nthe Cepheid distance scale, where metal-poor Cepheids are hotter and fainter\nthan metal-rich Cepheids. For V and I we found that the mean magnitude change\nis -0.14 +/- 0.14 mag/dex and the mean color change is 0.13 +/- 0.04 mag/dex,\nwith the change in color dominating the change in distance. The effect on Type\nIa supernova estimates of the Hubble constant is dramatic because most were\nfound in the metal poor galaxies with the bluest Cepheids.

The Chicago Air Shower\nArray (CASA), operating in coincidence with the Michigan muon array (MIA), has\nrecorded over 2.2 x 10^{9} air showers from April 4, 1990 to October 7, 1995.\nWe search for gamma rays based upon the muon content of air showers arriving\nfrom the direction of the galactic plane. We find no significant evidence for\ndiffuse gamma-ray emission, and we set an upper limit on the ratio of gamma\nrays to normal hadronic cosmic rays at less than 2.4 x 10^{-5} at 310 TeV (90%\nconfidence limit) from the galactic plane region: (50 degrees < l < 200\ndegrees); -5 degrees < b < 5 degrees). This limit places a strong constraint on\nmodels for emission from molecular clouds in the galaxy. We rule out\nsignificant spectral hardening in the outer galaxy, and conclude that emission\nfrom the plane at these energies is likely to be dominated by the decay of\nneutral pions resulting from cosmic rays interactions with passive target gas\nmolecules.",

A star-formation rate of\nabout 100 solar masses per year is required, similar to the values necessary to\nproduce the alignment effect in high-redshift radio galaxies.

This Bragg glass phase undergoes a\ntransition at higher fields into another glassy phase, with dislocations, or a\nliquid. This proposition is compatible with a large number of experimental\nresults on BSCCO or Thalium compounds. Further experimental consequences of our\nresults and relevance to other systems will be discussed.\n  When such vortex systems are driven by an external force, we show that, due\nto periodicity in the direction transverse to motion, the effects of static\ndisorder persist even at large velocity. In $d=3$, at weak disorder, or large\nvelocity the lattice forms a topologically ordered glass state, the ``moving\nBragg glass'', an anisotropic version of the static Bragg glass. The lattice\nflows through well-defined, elastically coupled, static channels. We determine\nthe roughness of the manifold of channels and the positional correlation\nfunctions. The channel structure also provides a natural starting point to\nstudy the influence of topological defects such as dislocations. In $d=2$ or at\nstrong disorder the channels can decouple along the direction of motion leading\nto a ``smectic'' like flow. We also show that such a structure exhibits an\neffective transverse critical pinning force due to barriers to transverse\nmotion, and discuss the experimental consequences of this effect.",

A strong leading effect for Xi^- produced by Sigma^- is observed. The\ninfluence of the target mass on the Xi^- cross section is explored by comparing\nreactions on copper and carbon nuclei.",

We have reduced the linearized perturbation equations to a\nsecond-order differential equation which resembles the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation\nwith the potential of a harmonic oscillator. Depending on the signs of energy\nand potential terms, eigensolutions can be classified into ``continuum'' and\n``discrete'' families. When magnetic field is ignored, the continuum family is\nidentified as the convective mode, while the discrete family as\nacoustic-gravity waves. If the effective adiabatic index $\\gamma$ is less than\nunity, the former develops into the convective instability. When a magnetic\nfield is included, the continuum and discrete families further branch into\nseveral solutions with different characters. The continuum family is divided\ninto two modes: one is the original Parker mode, which is a slow MHD mode\nmodulated by the gravity, and the other is a stable Alfv\\'en mode. The Parker\nmodes can be either stable or unstable depending on $\\gamma$. When $\\gamma$ is\nsmaller than a critical value $\\gamma_{cr}$, the Parker mode becomes unstable.\nThe discrete family is divided into three modes: a stable fast MHD mode\nmodulated by the gravity, a stable slow MHD mode modulated by the gravity, and\nan unstable mode which is also attributed to a slow MHD mode. The unstable\ndiscrete mode does not always exist. Even though the unstable discrete mode\nexists, the Parker mode dominates it if the Parker mode is unstable. However,\nif $\\gamma \\ge \\gamma_{cr}$, the discrete mode could be the only unstable one.\nWhen $\\gamma$ is equal $\\gamma_{cr}$, the minimum growth time of the unstable\ndiscrete mode is $1.3 \\times 10^8$ years with a corresponding length scale of\n2.4 kpc. It is suggestive that the corrugatory features seen in the Galaxy and\nexternal galaxies are related to the unstable discrete mode.",

In this paper we study the effects of the fermion determinant at nonzero\nchemical potential on the Dirac spectrum by means of the resolvent, G(z), of\nthe QCD Dirac operator. The resolvent is studied both in a one-dimensional U(1)\nmodel (Gibbs model) and in a random matrix model with the global symmetries of\nthe QCD partition function. In both cases we find that, if the argument z of\nthe resolvent is not equal to the mass m in the fermion determinant, the\nresolvent diverges in the thermodynamic limit.

The construction leads to a quantum theory including a Hilbert\nspace, a complete system of operator observables and a unitary time evolution.\nThe method is applied to the 2+1 gravity. The paper is restricted to the\nmetric-torus sector, zero cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ and it makes strong\nuse of the so-called homogeneous gauge; the chosen algebra of perennials is\nthat due to Martin. Two frequent problems are tackled. First, the Lie algebra\nof perennials does not generate a group of symmetries. The notion of group\ncompletion of a reparametrization invariant system is introduced so that the\ngroup does act; the group completion of the physical phase space of our model\nis shown to add only some limit points to it so that the ranges of observables\nare not unduly changed. Second, a relatively large number of relations between\nobservables exists; they are transferred to the quantum theory by the\nwell-known methods due to Kostant and Kirillov. In this way, a uniqueness of\nthe physical representation of some extension of Martin's algebra is shown. The\nHamiltonian is defined by a systematic procedure due to Dirac; for the torus\nsector, the result coincides with that by Moncrief. The construction may be\nextensible to higher genera and non-zero $\\Lambda$ of the 2+1 gravity, because\nsome complete sets of perennials are well-known and there are no obstructions\nto the closure of the algebra.",

On such a lattice, the integral of gauge\nvariables over boundaries or singular lines -- which now always bound three\ncoloured surfaces -- only contributes when four singular lines intersect at one\nvertex and can be explicitly computed producing a 6-j or Racah symbol. We\nperformed a strong coupling expansion for the free energy. The convergence of\nthe series expansions is quite different from the series expansions which were\nperformed in ordinary cubic lattices. In the case of ordinary cubic lattices\nthe strong coupling expansions up to the considered truncation number of\nplaquettes have the great majority of their coefficients positive, while in our\ncase we have almost equal number of contributions with both signs. Finally, it\nis discused the connection in the naive coupling limit between this action and\nthat of the B-F topological field theory and also with the pure gravity action.",

The density of cold gas at redshifts\nz=3+-1 is obtained from the mean HI column density of DLAs per cosmological\npath length. This path length per unit redshift is in turn a sensitive function\nof the vacuum density parameter, Omega_v. We compare the total inferred mass of\ncold gas at high redshifts to that observed in stars today for flat\ncosmologies. We define \"eta\" to be net fraction of the baryonic content of\nlocal galaxies which was expelled since z=3, and use Bayesian inference to\nderive confidence regions in the (eta, Omega_v) plane. In all cosmologies we\nfind that eta<0.4 with at least 95% confidence if <25% of the current stellar\npopulation formed before z=3. The most likely value of eta is negative,\nimplying a net increase by several tens of percent in the baryonic mass of\ngalaxies since z=3+-1. On the other hand, recent observations of high metal\nabundances in the intracluster medium of rich clusters (Loewenstein & Mushotzky\n1996) require that metal-rich gas be expelled from galaxies in an amount\napproximately equal to the current mass in stars. Based on our results and the\nlow metallicity observed in DLAs at z>2, we infer that more than half of the\nbaryonic mass processed through galaxies must have been assembled and partly\nexpelled from galaxies after z=2. We expect our constraints to improve\nconsiderably as the size of the DLA sample will increase with the forthcoming\nSloan Digital Sky Survey.",

Soft and collinear\nsingularities are extracted using the phase space slicing method. The collinear\nphoton initial state singularity depends logarithmically on the mass of the\nvirtual photon and is absorbed into the virtual photon structure function. An\n$\\overline{MS}$ factorization scheme is defined similarly to the real photon\ncase. Numerical results are presented for HERA conditions using the Snowmass\njet definition for inclusive single jet and dijet cross sections. We study the\ndependence of these cross sections on the transverse energies and rapidities of\nthe jets. Finally, we compare the ratio of the experimentally defined resolved\nand direct cross sections with recent ZEUS data as a function of the photon\nvirtuality $P^2$.",

The ground state\nproperties and the one-electron spectral function are obtained for a single\nelectron interacting with Einstein phonons by a mapping of the lattice problem\nonto a polaronic impurity model. The one-electron propagator of the impurity\nmodel is calculated through a continued fraction expansion (CFE), both at zero\nand finite temperature, for any electron-phonon coupling and phonon energy. In\ncontrast to the ground state properties such as the effective polaron mass,\nwhich have a smooth behaviour, spectral properties exhibit a sharp qualitative\nchange at low enough phonon frequency: beyond a critical coupling, one energy\ngap and then more and more open in the density of states at low energy, while\nthe high energy part of the spectrum is broad and can be explained by a strong\ncoupling adiabatic approximation. As a consequence narrow and coherent\nlow-energy subbands coexist with an incoherent featureless structure at high\nenergy. The subbands denote the formation of quasiparticle polaron states.\nAlso, divergencies of the self-energy may occur in the gaps. At finite\ntemperature such effect triggers an important damping and broadening of the\npolaron subbands. On the other hand, in the large phonon frequency regime such\na separation of energy scales does not exist and the spectrum has always a\nmultipeaked structure.",

Analysis of the absorption line systems with metals\nyields the following results. (1) The dense cluster of C IV doublets at 2.432 <\nz(abs) < 2.441 shows the weak line of one C IV absorber apparently aligned with\nthe strong line of a different C IV doublet, i.e., line locked, for two pairs\nof C IV absorbers. This is surprising since these absorption lines are\ndisplaced by more than 24000 km/s from the QSO redshift, but it is possible\nthat these alignments are coincidental. (2) Physical conditions in the Lyman\nlimit absorber at z(abs) = 2.3150 differ significantly from the Galactic\ngaseous halo, and photoionization models require [Si/H] > -0.95 and [Al/H] >\n-0.96 for the strongest component of this absorber. Abundances of three other\nLyman limit absorbers are also derived from photoionization models. (3)\nUnsaturated C IV and rather strong N V are detected in the associated absorber\nat z(abs) = 2.7125. The apparent column density profiles indicate that N V is\naffected by unresolved saturation or that the N V absorbing gas does not\ncompletely cover the QSO flux source. From photoionization models we derive\n[N/H] > -0.65 and [C/H] > -0.82.

The\nabnormal solutions of the Bethe-Salpeter equation (corresponding to excitations\nin the relative time-energy degree of freedom), when they exist, are recovered\nin the 3D reductions via a complicated dependence of the final potential on the\ntotal energy. We know however that the one-body (or one high mass) limit of\nsome 3D reductions of the exact Bethe-Salpeter equation leads to a compact 3D\nequation (by a mutual cancellation of the ladder and crossed graph\ncontributions), which does not exhibit this kind of dependence on the total\nenergy anymore. We conclude that the exact Bethe-Salpeter equation has no\nabnormal solution at this limit, or has only solutions for which our 3D wave\nfunction vanishes. This is in contrast with the results of the ladder\napproximation, where no such cancellation occurs. We draw the same conclusions\nfor the static model, which we obtain by letting the mass of the lighter\nparticle go also to infinity. These results support Wick's conjecture that the\nabnormal solutions are a spurious consequence of the ladder approximation.",

The corresponding experimental techniques\nfor that concern photoemission and inverse photoemission spectroscopy. The\nevolution of the density of states as a function of concentration of charge\ncarriers and strength of the electron-phonon interaction clearly shows the\nopening up of a gap between single polaronic and bi-polaronic states, in\nanalogy to the Hubbard problem for strongly correlated electron systems. The\ncrossover regime between adiabatic and anti-adiabatic small polarons is\ntriggered by two characteristic time scales: the renormalized electron hopping\nrate and the renormalized vibrational frequency becoming equal. This crossover\nregime is then characterized by temporarily alternating self- localization and\ndelocalization of the charge carriers which is accompanied by phase slips in\nthe charge and molecular deformation oscillations and ultimately leads to a\ndephasing between these two dynamical components of the polaron problem. We\nvisualize these features by a study of the temporal evolution of the charge\nredistribution and the change in molecular deformations.

Simulation of dynamics in the space of internal\ncoordinates, that is with bond lengths, bond angles and torsions as independent\nvariables, gives a theoretical possibility to eliminate all uninteresting fast\ndegrees of freedom from the system. This paper presents a new method for\ninternal coordinate molecular dynamics simulations of macromolecules.

In the numerical tests the\ninternal coordinate dynamics are compared with the traditional Cartesian\ncoordinate molecular dynamics in simulations a 56 residue globular protein. It\nis shown that the traditional and internal coordinate dynamics require the same\ntime step size for the same accuracy and that in the standard geometry\napproximation of amino acids, that is with fixed bond lengths, bond angles and\nrigid aromatic groups, the characteristic step size is 4 fsec, that is two\ntimes higher than with fixed bond lengths only.

The poor\nradiative efficiency of this accretion solution accounts for the fact that\nmassive black holes, which are believed to reside in the centres of these\ngalaxies, do not have the luminosities expected if accretion from the hot\ninterstellar medium occurs at the Bondi rate. We discuss the\nadvection-dominated solution for the nucleus of M60 (NGC 4649) and show that\naccretion at the Bondi rate is consistent with the core flux from radio to\nX-ray. This solution allows for a black hole mass of ~ 10^9 solar masses as\nrequired by independent arguments. The successful application of this model to\nboth M60, and previously to the well known nucleus of M87, suggests that\naccretion of hot gas in an elliptical galaxy creates the ideal circumstances\nfor advection-dominated accretion flows to operate.",

Sectorial Lorentz invariance,\nreflected by the fact that all particles of a given dynamical sector have the\nsame critical speed in vacuum, will then be an expression of a fundamental\nsectorial symmetry (e.g. preonic grand unification or extended supersymmetry)\nprotecting a parameter of the equations of motion. We study the breaking of\nLorentz invariance in such a scenario, with emphasis on mixing between the\n\"ordinary\" sector and a superluminal sector, and discuss with examples the\nconsequences of existing data. The sectorial universality of the value of the\nhigh-energy speed in vacuum, even exact, does not necessarily imply that\nLorentz invariance is not violated and does not by itself exclude the\npossibility to produce superluminal particles at accelerators or to find them\nin experiments devoted to high-energy cosmic rays. Similarly, the stringent\nexperimental bounds on Lorentz symmetry violation at low energy cannot be\nextrapolated to high-energy phenomena. Several basic questions related to\npossible effects of Lorentz symmetry violation are discussed, and potential\nsignatures are examined.",

    "summary": "Multiple resolution analysis of two dimensional structures composed of\nrandomly adsorbed penetrable rods, for densities below the percolation\nthreshold, has been carried out using box-counting functions. It is found that\nat relevant resolutions, for box-sizes, $r$, between cutoffs given by the\naverage rod length $<\\ell>$ and the average inter-rod distance $r_1$, these\nsystems exhibit apparent fractal behavior. It is shown that unlike the case of\nrandomly distributed isotropic objects, the upper cutoff $r_1$ is not only a\nfunction of the coverage but also depends on the excluded volume, averaged over\nthe orientational distribution. Moreover, the apparent fractal dimension also\ndepends on the orientational distributions of the rods and decreases as it\nbecomes more anisotropic. For box sizes smaller than $<\\ell>$ the box counting\nfunction is determined by the internal structure of the rods, whether simple or\nitself fractal. Two examples are considered - one of regular rods of one\ndimensional structure and rods which are trimmed into a Cantor set structure\nwhich are fractals themselves. The models examined are relevant to adsorption\nof linear molecules and fibers, liquid crystals, stress induced fractures and\nedge imperfections in metal catalysts. We thus obtain a distinction between two\nranges of length scales: $r < <\\ell>$ where the internal structure of the\nadsorbed objects is probed, and $<\\ell> < r < r_1$ where their distribution is\nprobed, both of which may exhibit fractal behavior. This distinction is\nrelevant to the large class of systems which exhibit aggregation of a finite\ndensity of fractal-like clusters, which includes surface growth in molecular\nbeam epitaxy and diffusion-limited-cluster-cluster-aggregation models.",

There are a variety of scenarios leading to acceptably small\nZ-Z' mixing and other phenomenological consequences, all of which involve some\nbut not excessive fine tuning. One class, driven by a large trilinear soft\nsupersymmetry breaking term, implies small mixing, a light Z' (e.g., 200 GeV),\nand an electroweak phase transition that may be first order at tree level. In\nanother class, with m_S^2 < 0 (radiative breaking), the typical scale of\ndimensional parameters, including M_{Z'} and the effective mu, is O(1 TeV), but\nthe electroweak scale is smaller due to cancellations. We relate the soft\nsupersymmetry breaking parameters at the electroweak scale to those at the\nstring scale, choosing Yukawa couplings as determined within a class of string\nmodels. We find that one does not obtain either scenario for universal soft\nsupersymmetry breaking mass parameters at the string scale and no exotic\nmultiplets contributing to the renormalization group equations.

    "summary": "Most modern formalisms used in Databases and Artificial Intelligence for\ndescribing an application domain are based on the notions of class (or concept)\nand relationship among classes. One interesting feature of such formalisms is\nthe possibility of defining a class, i.e., providing a set of properties that\nprecisely characterize the instances of the class. Many recent articles point\nout that there are several ways of assigning a meaning to a class definition\ncontaining some sort of recursion. In this paper, we argue that, instead of\nchoosing a single style of semantics, we achieve better results by adopting a\nformalism that allows for different semantics to coexist. We demonstrate the\nfeasibility of our argument, by presenting a knowledge representation\nformalism, the description logic muALCQ, with the above characteristics. In\naddition to the constructs for conjunction, disjunction, negation, quantifiers,\nand qualified number restrictions, muALCQ includes special fixpoint constructs\nto express (suitably interpreted) recursive definitions. These constructs\nenable the usual frame-based descriptions to be combined with definitions of\nrecursive data structures such as directed acyclic graphs, lists, streams, etc.\nWe establish several properties of muALCQ, including the decidability and the\ncomputational complexity of reasoning, by formulating a correspondence with a\nparticular modal logic of programs called the modal mu-calculus.",

Subsequently, we discuss rigorous bounds for the\na-posteriori distribution function of the signal probability, as well as for\nthe (closely related) likelihood that there are $N_s$ signals in the data.

A comparison with\nstandard spin-wave approaches is performed. The sublattice magnetization, Neel\ntemperature and spin correlation function are calculated to first order of the\n1/N-expansion. A description of crossover from a 2D-like to 3D regime of\nsublattice magnetization temperature dependence is obtained. The values of the\ncritical exponents derived are \\beta =0.36, \\eta =0.09. An account of the\ncorrections to the standard logarithmic term of the spin-wave theory modifies\nconsiderably the value of the Neel temperature. The thermodynamic quantities\ncalculated are universal functions of the renormalized interlayer coupling\nparameter. The renormalization of interlayer coupling parameter turns out to be\nconsiderably temperature dependent. A good agreement with experimental data on\nLa2CuO4 is obtained. The application of the approach used to the case of a\nferromagnet is discussed.",

    "summary": "The recent detection of interstellar polarization in the solid CO feature\nnear 4.67 micron shows that CO-mantled grains can be aligned in cold molecular\nclouds. These observations conflict with a theory of grain alignment which\nattributes the polarization in molecular clouds to the effects of cosmic rays:\naccording to this theory, oblate spheroidal grains with H_2O and CO_2-dominated\nice mantles are spun up to suprathermal energies by molecular evaporation from\ncosmic ray impact sites but spin up does not occur for CO-mantled grains.\nMotivated by this conflict, we reexamine the effects of cosmic rays on the\nalignment of icy grains. We show that the systematic torques produced by cosmic\nrays are insufficient to cause suprathermal spin. In principle, the random\ntorques due to cosmic rays can enhance the efficiency of Davis-Greenstein\nalignment by raising the grain rotational temperature. However, a significant\nenhancement would require cosmic ray fluxes 6--7 orders of magnitude larger\nthan the flux in a typical cold cloud.",

One is super-roughening (global roughness\nexponent larger than or equal to one), even if the spectrum behaves non\nanomalously. Another cause is what we term an intrinsically anomalous spectrum,\nin whose scaling an independent exponent exists, which induces different\nscaling properties for small and large length scales (that is, the surface is\nnot self-affine). In this case, the surface does not need to be super-rough in\norder to display anomalous scaling. In both cases, we show how to extract the\nindependent exponents and scaling relations from the correlation functions, and\nwe illustrate our analysis with two exactly solvable examples. One is the\nsimplest linear equation for molecular beam epitaxy , well known to display\nanomalous scaling due to super-roughening.

    "summary": "Laboratory experiments on gravitation are usually performed with objects of\nconstant density, so that the analysis of the forces concerns only the geometry\nof their shape. In an ideal experiment, the shapes of the constituent parts\nwill be optimised to meet certain mathematical criteria, which ensure that the\nexperiment has maximal sensitivity.\n  Using this idea, the author suggested an experiment to determine the\ndeparture of the gravitational force from Newton's force law [1]. The\ngeometrical problem which has to be solved is to find two shapes which differ\nsignificantly, but have the same Newtonian potential. Essentially, the\nexperiment determines whether the two objects are distinguishable by their\ngravitational force. Here, we consider the case when one of them is a round\nball. The result, Theorem 1, establishes a fact which appeared in numerical\nsimulations, that the second object has to have a hole in it.",

    "summary": "The measurement of precise galaxy distances by Cepheid observations out to\nthe distance of the Virgo cluster is important for the determination of the\nHubble constant ($H_0$). The Virgo cluster is thereby often used as an\nimportant stepping stone. The first HST measurement of the distance of a Virgo\ngalaxy (M100) using Cepheid variables provided a value for $H_0=80(\\pm 17)$\nkm/s/Mpc (Freedman et al. 1994). This measurement was preceeded by a ground\nbased study of the Virgo spiral NGC4571 (Pierce et al. 1994) formally providing\n$H_0= 87\\pm7$ km/s/Mpc. These determinations rely on the accuracy with which\nthe position of this observed spiral galaxy can be located with respect to the\nVirgo cluster center. This uncertainty introduces a major error in the\ndetermination of $H_0$, together with the uncertainty in the adopted Virgo\ninfall velocity of the Local Group. Here we propose the use of spiral galaxies\nwhich show clear signs of being stripped off their interstellar medium by the\nintracluster gas of the Virgo cluster as targets for the Cepheid distance\nmeasurements. We show that the stripping process and the knowledge of the\nintracluster gas distribution from ROSAT X-ray observations allow us to locate\nthese galaxies with an at least three times higher precision with respect to\nM87 than in the case of other spirals like M100. The X-ray observations further\nimply that M87 is well centered within the intracluster gas halo of the Virgo\ncluster and that M86 is associated with a group of galaxies and a larger dark\nmatter halo. The combination of these informations could enable us to locate\nthe two stripped spiral galaxies quite precisely within the Virgo cluster and\ncould greatly improve the determination of the Virgo cluster distance.",

Observed every three days\nfor about 9 months, this is the first well sampled X-ray light curve on these\ntime scales. The flares and quiescent periods in the light curve suggest that\nthe variability is nonlinear, and a statistical test yields a detection with >6\nsigma confidence. The structure function has a steep slope ~0.7, while the\nperiodogram is much steeper with a slope ~2.6, with the difference partially\ndue to a linear trend in the data. The non-stationary character of the light\ncurve could be evidence that the variability power spectrum has not turned over\nto low frequencies, or it could be an essential part of the nonlinear process.\nEvidence for X-ray reprocessing suggests that the X-ray emission is not from\nthe compact radio jet, and the reduced variability before and after flares\nsuggests there cannot be two components contributing to the X-ray short term\nvariability. Thus, these results cannot be explained easily by simple models\nfor AGN variability, including shot noise which may be associated with flares\nin disk-corona models or active regions on a rotating disk, because in those\nmodels the events are independent and the variability is therefore linear. The\ncharacter of the variability is similar to that seen in Cygnus X-1, which has\nbeen explained by a reservoir or self-organized criticality model. Inherently\nnonlinear, this model can reproduce the reduced variability before and after\nlarge flares and the steep PDS seen generally from AGN. The 3C 390.3 light\ncurve presented here is the first support for such models to explain AGN\nvariability on intermediate time scales from a few days to months.",

These data were\nobtained during the period 1995 January 2 to 1995 October 6 as part of an\nintensive multiwavelength monitoring campaign. The soft X-ray flux in the ROSAT\nband varied by nearly a factor of four during the campaign, and the\nwell-resolved light-curve shows several distinct features. Several large\namplitude flares were observed, including one in which the flux increased by a\nfactor of about 3 in 12 days. Periods of reduced variability were also seen,\nincluding one nearly 30 days long. While the HRI hardness ratio decreased\nsignificantly, it is apparently consistent with that expected due to the\ndetector during the monitoring period.\n  The two ASCA observations were made on 1995 January 15 and 1995 May 5. The\n0.5-10.0 keV spectra can be adequately described by an absorbed power-law.\nThere is no evidence for a soft excess in the ASCA spectra, indicating that the\nROSAT HRI is sampling variability of the X-ray power-law. A broad iron line was\nobserved in a longer 1993 ASCA observation, and while there is statistical\nevidence that the line is present in the 1995 spectra, it could not be resolved\nclearly. There is evidence, significant at >90% confidence, that the photon\nindex changed from 1.7 to 1.82 while the flux increased by 63%. The spectral\nchange can be detected in the spectra below 5 keV, indicating that the origin\ncannot be a change in ratio of reflected to power-law flux. A compilation of\nresults from ASCA and Ginga observations show that on long time scales the\nintrinsic photon index is correlated with the flux.",

The simulations\nare performed using a newly developed multi-mass scheme which combines a PM\ncode with a high resolution N-body code. Numerical effects due to time stepping\nand gravitational softening are investigated as well as the influence of the\nsimulation box size and of the assumed boundary conditions. Special emphasis is\nlaid on the formation process and the influence of various cosmological\nparameters. Cosmogonies with massive neutrinos are also considered. Differences\nbetween clusters in the same cosmological model seem to dominate over\ndifferences due differing background cosmogony. The cosmological model can\nalter the time evolution of cluster collapse, but the merging pattern remains\nfairly similar, e.g. number of mergers and mass ratio of mergers. The gross\nproperties of a halo, such as its size and total angular momentum, also evolve\nin a similar manner for all cosmogonies and can be described using analytical\nmodels. It is shown that the density distribution of a halo shows a\ncharacteristic radial dependence which follows a power law with a slope of\n$\\alpha=-1$ at small and $\\alpha=-3$ at large radii, independent of the\nbackground cosmogony or the considered redshift. The shape of the density\nprofiles follows the generic form proposed by Navarro et al.

Only the central matter\nconcentration of a halo is correlated to the formation time and therefore to\nthe corresponding cosmogony.

In the\nradio, the system appears as two compact, dominant features surrounded by\nrelatively extended radio emission which forms an Einstein Ring. As the line of\nsight to it passes close to our Galactic center, PKS1830-211 has not been\ndetected in wave-bands other than the radio and X-ray so far. Here we present\nX-ray data of PKS1830-211 observed with ROSAT PSPC. The X-ray spectrum shows\nthat absorption in excess of the Galactic contribution is highly likely, which\nat the redshift of the lensing galaxy ($z_l=0.886$) corresponds to\nN$_H=3.5^{+0.6}_{-0.5}\\times 10^{22}$ atoms cm$^{-2}$. The effective optical\nextinction is large, A$_V$(observed)\\gax5.8. When corrected for this additional\nextinction, the two point optical to X-ray slope \\aox\\ of PKS1830-211 lies just\nwithin the observed range of quasars. It is argued here that both compact\nimages must be covered by the X-ray absorber(s) which we infer to be the\nlensing galaxy(galaxies). The dust to gas ratio along the line of sight within\nthe lensing galaxy is likely to be somewhat larger than for our Galaxy.",

Both the open\ndots and the tunnel-contacted dots show random, repeatable conductance\nfluctuations with universal statistical proper-ties that are accurately\ncharacterized by a variety of theoretical models including random matrix\ntheory, semiclassical methods and nonlinear sigma model calculations. We apply\nthese results in open dots to extract the dephasing rate of electrons within\nthe dot. In the tunneling regime, electron interaction dominates transport\nsince the tunneling of a single electron onto a small dot may be sufficiently\nenergetically costly (due to the small capacitance) that conduction is\nsuppressed altogether. How interactions combine with quantum interference are\nbest seen in this regime.",

We use filters with bandpasses ~60A FWHM, centered on the Mg\nand Fe features (5176A and 5270A respectively) allowing the determination of\nthe spatial distribution of the Lick indices Mg2 and Fe5270. These two indices\nhave been extensively modeled by different groups and used in the past mainly\nfor the study of elliptical galaxies, bulges, and globular clusters. Azimuthal\nintegration of the underlying smooth stellar signal, after removal of the\nsignature of the spiral arms and associated extreme pop. I structures, provides\nmeasurements of these spectral indices useful to radial distances where the\nsurface brightness of the galaxy reaches ~24uV. As a first example of this\ntechnique and its possibilities we conduct a preliminary study of the SABbc\ngalaxy NGC 4321 (M 100). We present spectral gradients for the inter-arm\nstellar population to about 4 exponential scale lengths. There is some evidence\nfor a discontinuity in the run of the Mg2 index near corotation, which we\ninterpret as evidence for bar- driven secular evolution. There is also evidence\nthat Mg is overabundant with respect to Fe in the inner regions of the\nprojected image.",

This holds for both dynamical and thermal timescales. Those\nsystems which are not stable will usually transfer mass on the thermal\ntimescale.

This relation is similar to the standard\nFundamental Plane (FP), and is obtained by replacing the velocity dispersion\nparameter with the difference between the magnitude of a galaxy and that of the\nmode of the Gaussian luminosity function of E and S0 galaxies. The dispersion\nin the PFP is comparable to that of the standard FP. However, the use of the\nmode of the luminosity function to compute the magnitude differences introduces\na systematic uncertainty in the derivation of the PFP relation zero-point, so\nthat its accuracy for distance determinations does not scale with the square\nroot of the number of objects used to perform the fit. The method is also\nvulnerable to any bias that might affect the estimate of the mode of the\nluminosity function. If however the mode of the luminosity function can be\nreliably determined, the PFP relation can provide distance estimates with an\naccuracy comparable to the FP relation, with the advantage that the use of\nphotometric parameters alone reduces drastically the observational requirements\nof the PFP, in comparison with those of the FP relation. This practical\nadvantage makes the PFP a very economical distance indication method.",

We find that the peak separation is not constant, as expected in\nsome beat-frequency models, but instead varies from ~310 to ~230 Hz when the\ncentroid frequency of the higher-frequency peak varies from ~875 to ~1085 Hz.\nWe detect none of the additional QPO peaks at higher frequencies predicted in\nthe photon bubble model (PBM), with best-case upper limits on the peaks' power\nratio of 0.025.

This inspiralling phase of a binary\nsystem's evolution generally will be very long compared to the system's orbital\nperiod, but the final coalescence may be dynamical and driven to a large degree\nby hydrodynamic effects, particularly if there is a critical separation at\nwhich the system becomes dynamically unstable toward merger. Indeed, if weakly\nrelativistic systems (such as white dwarf-white dwarf binaries) encounter a\npoint of dynamical instability at some critically close separation, coalescence\nmay be entirely a classical, hydrodynamic process. Therefore, a proper\ninvestigation of this stage of binary evolution must include three-dimensional\nhydrodynamic simulations. We have constructed equilibrium sequences of\nsynchronously rotating, equal-mass binaries in circular orbit with a single\nparameter - the binary separation - varying along each sequence. Sequences have\nbeen constructed with various polytropic as well as realistic white dwarf and\nneutron star equations of state. Using a Newtonian, finite-difference\nhydrodynamics code, we have examined the dynamical stability of individual\nmodels along these equilibrium sequences. Our simulations indicate that no\npoints of instability exist on the sequences we analyzed that had relatively\nsoft equations of state (polytropic sequences with polytropic index $n=1.0$ and\n1.5 and two white dwarf sequences). However, we did identify dynamically\nunstable binary models on sequences with stiffer equations of state ($n=0.5$\npolytropic sequence and two neutron star sequences).

We discuss four procedures to\ngenerate eigenstates of a complete set of commuting operators starting from the\nrest state. One result of this work is the fact that upon deforming to the\nquantum Poincar\\'e algebra the rest state is split into an infinite number of\nstates. Another result is that the energy spectrum of these states is discrete.\nSome curious residual degeneracy remains: there are states constructed by\napplying different operators to the rest state which nevertheless are\nindistinguishable by eigenvalues of all the observables in the algebra.",

The K' information is particularly\nimportant for the present discussion because it is not seriously affected by\nobscuration. There is reasonably convincing evidence that the distribution of\nexponential disk central surface brightnesses is bimodal. Disks avoid the\ndomain between the high and low surface brightness zones. The few intermediate\nsurface brightness examples in the sample all have significant nearby\nneighbors. The high surface brightness (HSB) galaxies exhibit a range\n-21<M(B)<-17 while the low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies are found with\n-19<M(B) down to the completion limit. HSB and LSB galaxies in the overlap\nregime -19<M(B)<-17 that are indistinguishable in luminosity-line width plots\nhave very distinct locations in surface brightness-scale length plots. The\nexistence of separate HSB and LSB families suggests that there are discrete\nradial configurations that are stable. Galaxies are driven into one of these\nregimes. The HSB state has a lower luminosity cutoff. It is likely that the HSB\ngalaxies are dominated by dissipational matter at their centers while the LSB\ngalaxies are dark matter dominated. The HSB family subdivides into those with,\nand without, substantial bulges. Evidently, there are two thresholds probably\ncontrolled by angular momentum content or transfer. Passing from high to low\nspecific angular momentum, there is first the transition from LSB to HSB\nregimes, then the transition from exponential disk to disk plus bulge regimes.",

The RMS scatter of the Leo I\ngalaxies in each color is extremely small, consistent with the group's\ncompactness. These relations yield estimates of the Coma-Leo I distance ratio\nof 9.01 +/- 0.51, 8.77 +/- 0.43, and 8.82 +/- 0.31, respectively, with a\nweighted mean of 8.84 +/- 0.23. The general agreement among the three colors\nindicates that the early-type galaxies in Leo I and Coma have similar stellar\npopulations.\n  The Coma-Leo I distance ratio coupled with estimates of the absolute distance\nto the Leo I group allows the Hubble constant to be determined, free of the\nuncertainties which arise when working with the Virgo cluster. Several high\nquality distance estimates are available from a variety of techniques: Cepheids\nin M96 (Tanvir et al. 1995) and M95 (Graham et al. 1997), surface brightness\nfluctuations (Tonry et al. 1997), planetary nebulae luminosity functions\n(Ciardullo et al. 1993), and the luminosity of the red giant branch tip (Sakai,\nFreedman, & Madore 1996).

The shape of the\nlines varied subtly; there was an interval during which the variation in the\nratio of the fluxes of the two peaks appeared to be sinusoidal, with a period\nof 2.16 years and an amplitude of about 16% of the average value. The variable\npart of the broad H-alpha line is well fit by a model in which a region of\nexcess emission (a quiescent ``hot spot'') within an accretion disk (fitted to\nthe non-varying portion of the double-peaked line) completes at least two\ncircular orbits and eventually fades. Fits to spectra from epochs when the hot\nspot is not present allow determination of the disk inclination, while fits for\nepochs when it is present provide a measurement of the radius of the hot spot's\norbit. From these data and the period of variation, we find that the mass\nwithin the hot spot's orbit is 2.2 +0.2/-0.7 times 10^8 solar masses, within\nthe range of previous estimates of masses of active galactic nuclei. Because\nthis mass is determined at a relatively small distance (~1000 AU) from the\ncentral body, it is extremely difficult to explain without assuming that a\nsupermassive black hole lies within Arp 102B. The lack of any systematic change\nin the velocity of the blue peak over time yields a lower limit on the combined\nmass of the two bodies in a binary black hole model like that of Gaskell (1983)\nof 10^10 solar masses.",

Reflection is clearly detected in\nall the spectra, but its contribution is larger in the softer X-ray spectra\nseen in outburst than in quiescence. This supports models in which the\nquiescent inner disk is not present or not optically thick, so that the only\nreflector is the white dwarf surface rather than the white dwarf plus the disk.\nWe detect partially ionized absorption in the ASCA outburst spectrum, which is\nprobably the X-ray signature of the outflowing wind. The ASCA data also allow a\ndetailed measure of the elemental abundances. We find that all detectable lines\nfrom the hot plasma (except perhaps Si and S) are a factor $\\sim 2.5\\times$\nweaker than expected from solar abundances. We examine possible deviations from\ncoronal equilibrium, but conclude that the heavy elements are truly\nunderabundant in SS Cyg.\n  In quiescence the underlying intrinsic spectrum is consistent with a single\ntemperature plasma. This conflicts with the expected cooling of the material,\nand requires that either the plasma is reheated or that the cooler emission is\nmasked by absorption in an optically thin inner disk which affects only that\npart of the boundary layer emission below the disk. By contrast, the outburst\nspectrum is much softer and is dominated by the cooling components but has a\ntotal hot plasma luminosity similar to that in quiescence, showing that the\noptically thin plasma emission is important even in outburst.",

Consequently a suppression of a 1D\ngap-induced mode as well as a constant intensity of a spinon continuum are\nobserved at low temperatures. A 3D two-magnon density of states now gradually\nextends to higher temperatures T\\leq 60K compared with pure CuGeO_3. This\neffect is more pronounced in the case of off-chain substitutions (Si) for which\na N\\'eel state occurs over a larger substitution range, starting at very low\nconcentrations. Besides, additional low energy excitations are induced. These\neffects, i.e. the shift of a dimensional crossover to higher temperatures are\ndue to an enhancement of the spin-spin correlations induced by a small amount\nof substitutions. The results are compared with recent Monte Carlo studies on\nsubstituted spin ladders, pointing to a similar instability of coupled,\ndimerized spin chains and spin ladders upon substitution.",

By the substitution\n$Q=\\pm\\exp(- \\phi/2)$, the Liouville theory for a smooth $\\phi$ is recovered in\nthe trivial topological sector. The nontrivial topological sectors can be\nviewed as singular sectors of the Liouville theory that contain blowing-up\nsolutions in terms of $\\phi$. Since the global Liouville equation is\nconformally invariant, its solutions can be described by explicitly listing\nthose solutions for which the stress-energy tensor belongs to a set of\nrepresentatives of the Virasoro coadjoint orbits chosen by convention. This\ndirect method permits to study the `coadjoint orbit content' of the topological\nsectors as well as the behaviour of the energy in the sectors. The analysis\nconfirms that the trivial topological sector contains special orbits with\nhyperbolic monodromy and shows that the energy is bounded from below in this\nsector only.",

Arcs suggestive of bow shocks are observed at the terminus\nof some of these filamentary structures. Most spectacular of all, one of the\nstructures appears to be a scaled-up version of a Herbig-Haro jet. The velocity\nfield of the filaments confirms that they represent material expelled from the\nnucleus (possibly in the form of `bullets') or entrained in a wide-angle wind\nroughly aligned with the polar axis of the galaxy. The motions observed across\nthe ionization cone are highly supersonic, so high-velocity shocks are likely\nto contribute to the ionization of the line emitting gas. However, it is not\nclear at present whether shock ionization dominates over photoionization by the\nSeyfert 2 nucleus. Extrapolation of the filaments to smaller radii comes to\nwithin 1 arcsec (about 20 pc) of the infrared nucleus, therefore suggesting a\nAGN or nuclear starburst origin to these features. The complex of radial\nfilaments detected in the Circinus galaxy is unique among active galaxies. The\nfrequency of such events is unknown since only a handful of galaxies have been\nobserved at the sensitivity level of our present observations. The event in the\nCircinus galaxy may represent a relatively common evolutionary phase in the\nlives of gas-rich active galaxies during which the dusty cocoon surrounding the\nnucleus is expelled by the action of jet or wind phenomena.",

We incorporate two Higgs doublet\nbosons $h$ and $SU(2)_R$ adjoint Higgs $\\xi_R$ which are as usual transformed\nas $(2,2^\\ast,0)$ and $(1,3,-2)$ under $SU(2)_L\\times SU(2)_R\\times U(1)$,\nrespectively.

Among the\nHiggs doublet bosons, one CP-even scalar boson survives in the weak energy\nscale and other four scalar bosons acquire the mass of the $SU(2)_R\\times U(1)$\nbreaking scale, which is similar to the situation in the standard model.\n$\\xi_R$ is responsible to spontaneously break $SU(2)\\ma{R} \\times U(1)$ down to\n$U(1)\\ma{Y}$ and so well explains the seesaw mechanism.

    "summary": "We re-examine the use of sum rules in the extraction of light quark masses\nand discuss a number of potential problems with existing analyses. The most\nimportant issue is that of the overall normalization of the hadronic spectral\nfunctions should not be fixed by assuming complete resonance dominance of the\ncontinuum threshold region as it can overestimate the resonance contributions\nto spectral integrals by factors as large as $\\sim 5$. The second important\nuncertainty comes from the assumed location, $s_0$, of the onset of duality\nwith perturbative QCD, as the extracted quark masses depend very sensitively on\nthis parameter. The assumption of duality and the requirement of positivity of\n$\\rho_5(s)$ imposes very severe constraints on the shape of the relevant\nspectral function in the dual region, and leads to rigorous lower bounds for\n$m_u+m_d$ as a function of $s_0$. In the extractions of $m_s$ we find that the\nconventional choice of the value of $s_0$ is not physical. For a more\nreasonable choice of $s_0$ we are not able to find a solution that is stable\nwith respect to variations of the Borel transform parameter. This problem can\nbe overcome only if the hadronic spectral function is determined up to\nsignificantly larger values of $s$ than is currently possible. Finally, we also\nestimate the error associated with the convergence of perturbative QCD\nexpressions used in the sum rule analyses. Our conclusion is that, taking all\nof these issues into account, the resulting sum rule estimates for both\n$m_u+m_d$ and $m_s$ could easily have uncertainties as large as a factor of 2.",

These configurations are described by constant\ncurvature connections in a dual gauge theory description. The low-energy string\nfluctuation spectrum is reproduced exactly by the gauge theory in the case of\nvanishing field strength; however, this correspondence breaks down for fixed\nnonzero field strength. We show that in many cases the full Born-Infeld action\ncorrectly captures the low-energy spectrum in the case of non-vanishing field\nstrength. This gives a field theory description of the low-energy physics of\nsystems of diagonally wound branes and branes at angles as considered by\nBerkooz, Douglas and Leigh. This description extends naturally to\nnon-supersymmetric configurations, where the tachyonic instability associated\nwith brane-anti-brane systems appears as an instability around a saddle point\nsolution of the corresponding Yang-Mills/Born-Infeld theory. In some cases, the\nfield theory description requires a non-abelian generalization of the\nBorn-Infeld action. We follow Tseytlin's recent proposal for formulating such\nan action. In the case of intersecting branes, the non-abelian Born-Infeld\ntheory produces a transcendental relation which comes tantalizingly close to\nreproducing the correct spectrum; however, a discrepancy remains which\nindicates that a further clarification of the non-abelian Born-Infeld action\nmay be necessary.",

    "summary": "A scheme is proposed for protecting quantum states from both independent\ndecoherence and cooperative decoherence. The scheme operates by pairing each\nqubit (two-state quantum system) with an ancilla qubit and by encoding the\nstates of the qubits into the corresponding coherence-preserving states of the\nqubit-pairs. In this scheme, the amplitude damping (loss of energy) is\nprevented as well as the phase damping (dephasing) by a strategy called the\nfree-Hamiltonian-elimination We further extend the scheme to include quantum\ngate operations and show that loss and decoherence during the gate operations\ncan also be prevented.",

The many particle-many hole configurations created in the rotating\nNilsson potential are mixed by the surface-delta two-body residual interaction.\nThe levels in the near-yrast region show a Poisson-like level spacing\ndistribution. As the intrinsic excitation energy $U$ increases, the level\nstatistics shows a gradual transition from order to chaos, reaching at $U\n\\gesim 2$ MeV the Wigner distribution typical of the Gaussian orthogonal\nensemble of random matrices. This transition is caused by the residual two-body\ninteraction. On the other hand, the level spacings between the yrast and the\nfirst excited state show a peculiar behaviour, displaying a Wigner-like\ndistribution instead of the Poisson-like distribution seen for the other\nnear-yrast rotational states. The lowest spacings reflect the properties of the\nsingle-particle orbits in the mean-field, and are only weakly affected by the\nresidual two-body interaction.",

    "summary": "This review is intended to give a pedagogical and unified view on the subject\nof the statistics and scaling of physical quantities in disordered electron\nsystems at very low temperatures. Quantum coherence at low temperatures and\nrandomness of microscopic details can cause large fluctuations of physical\nquantities. In such mesoscopic systems a localization-delocalization transition\ncan occur which forms a critical phenomenon. Accordingly, a one-parameter\nscaling theory was formulated stressing the role of conductance as the\n(one-parameter) scaling variable. However, the notion of an order parameter was\nnot fully clarified in this theory. Based on presently available analytical and\nnumerical results we focus here on the description of the total distribution\nfunctions and their flow with increasing system size. Still, one-parameter\nscaling theory does work in terms of typical values of the local density of\nstates and of the conductance which serve as order parameter and scaling\nvariable of the localization-delocalization transition, respectively. Below a\ncertain length scale, $\\xi_c$, related to the value of the typical conductance,\nlocal quantities are multifractally distributed. This multifractal behavior\nbecomes universal on approaching the localization-delocalization transition\nwith $\\xi_c$ playing the role of a correlation length.",

This is made\npossible by considering the equations of motion of various anomalous averages.\nThe resulting equation explicitly includes the effect of repeated binary\ninteractions (in particular ladders) between the atoms. Moreover, under the\nconditions that dressing of the intermediate states of a collision can be\nignored, this equation is shown to reduce to the conventional Gross-Pitaevskii\nequation in the pseudopotential limit. Extending the treatment, we show first\nhow the occupation of excited (bare particle) states affects the collisions,\nand thus obtain the many-body T-matrix approximation in a trap. In addition, we\ndiscuss how the bare particle many-body T-matrix gets dressed by mean fields\ndue to condensed and excited atoms. We conclude that the most commonly used\nversion of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation can only be put on a microscopic basis\nfor a restrictive range of conditions. For partial condensation, we need to\ntake account of interactions between condensed and excited atoms, which, in a\nconsistent formulation, should also be expressed in terms of the many-body\nT-matrix. This can be achieved by considering fluctuations around the\ncondensate mean field beyond those included in the conventional finite\ntemperature mean field, i.e. Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB), theory.",

The characteristics of these QPOs are remarkably\nsimilar from one source to another. In particular, the highest observed QPO\nfrequencies for 6 of the 8 sources fall in a very narrow range: 1,066 to 1,171\nHz. This is the more remarkable when one considers that these sources are\nthought to have very different luminosities and magnetic fields, and produce\nvery different count rates in the RXTE detectors. Therefore it is highly\nunlikely that this near constancy of the highest observed frequencies is due to\nsome unknown selection effect or instrumental bias. In this letter we propose\nthat the highest observed QPO frequency can be taken as the orbital frequency\nof the marginally stable orbit. This leads to the conclusions that the neutron\nstars in these LMXBs are inside their marginally stable orbits and have masses\nin the vicinity of 2.0 solar masses. This mass is consistent with the\nhypothesis that these neutron stars were born with about 1.4 solar masses and\nhave been accreting matter at a fraction of the Eddington limit for 100 million\nyears.",

This sheet propagates inwards with a velocity\ninversely proportional to the ratio of the field strength just inside the\ncurrent sheet to the equipartition field strength B0/Be, so the lifetime of a\ntube with constant internal flux density is increased approximately by a factor\nnot exceeding B0/Be, even for infinitely effective inhibition of turbulence\ninside the tube.

    "summary": "In recent years, our knowledge of photospheric magnetic fields went through a\nthorough transformation--nearly unnoticed by dynamo theorists. It is now\npractically certain that the overwhelming majority of the unsigned magnetic\nflux crossing the solar surface is in turbulent form (intranetwork and hidden\nfields). Furthermore, there are now observational indications (supported by\ntheoretical arguments discussed in this paper) that the net polarity imbalance\nof the turbulent field may give a significant or even dominant contribution to\nthe weak large-scale background magnetic fields outside unipolar network areas.\nThis turbulent magnetic field consists of flux tubes with magnetic fluxes below\n1e10 Wb (1e18 Mx). The motion of these thin tubes is dominated by the drag of\nthe surrounding flows, so the transport of this component of the solar magnetic\nfield must fully be determined by the kinematics of the turbulence (i.e. it is\n\"passive\"), and it can be described by a one-fluid model like mean-field theory\n(MFT). This paper reviews the theory of passive magnetic field transport using\nmostly first (and occasionally higher) order smoothing formalism; the most\nimportant transport effects are however also independently derived using\nLagrangian analysis for a simple two-component flow model. Solar applications\nof the theory are also presented. Among some other novel findings it is\nproposed that the observed unsigned magnetic flux density in the photosphere\nrequires a small-scale dynamo effect operating in the convective zone and that\nthe net polarity imbalance in turbulent (and, in particular, hidden) fields may\ngive a major contribution to the weak large-scale background magnetic fields on\nthe Sun.",

In order to make the problem\ntractable, these integration paths (\"cascade lines\") must be chosen in such a\nway that the behaviour of the energy spectral function along different cascade\nlines should be reasonably similar. In practice this is realized by defining\nthe cascade lines as the streamlines of a cascade flow; in the simplest case\nthe source of this flow may be identified with the source function of the\nturbulence. Owing to the different approximations involved, the resulting\nenergy spectral function is not exact but is expected to give good\napproximative values for the bulk quantities characterising the turbulent\nmedium, and for the measure of the anisotropy itself in particular.\n  The model is then applied to the case of low Prandtl number thermal\nconvection. The energy spectral function and the bulk quantities characterizing\nthe flow are derived for different values of the parameter $S=Ra \\sigma$.

LISA is not a pointed\ninstrument; it is an all-sky monitor with a quadrupolar beam pattern. LISA will\nmeasure simultaneously both polarization components of incoming gravitational\nwaves, so the data will consist of two time series. All physical properties of\nthe source, including its position, must be extracted from these time series.\nLISA's angular resolution is therefore not a fixed quantity, but rather depends\non the type of signal and on how much other information must be extracted.\nInformation about the source position will be encoded in the measured signal in\nthree ways: 1) through the relative amplitudes and phases of the two\npolarization components, 2) through the periodic Doppler shift imposed on the\nsignal by the detector's motion around the Sun, and 3) through the further\nmodulation of the signal caused by the detector's time-varying orientation. We\nderive the basic formulae required to calculate the LISA's angular resolution\n$\\Delta \\Omega_S$ for a given source. We then evaluate $\\Delta \\Omega_S$ for\ntwo sources of particular interest: monchromatic sources and mergers of\nsupermassive black holes. For these two types of sources, we calculate (in the\nhigh signal-to-noise approximation) the full variance-covariance matrix, which\ngives the accuracy to which all source parameters can be measured. Since our\nresults on LISA's angular resolution depend mainly on gross features of the\ndetector geometry, orbit, and noise curve, we expect these results to be fairly\ninsensitive to modest changes in detector design that may occur between now and\nlaunch. We also expect that our calculations could be easily modified to apply\nto a modified design.",

This initially high ``bias'' would consequently\ndecrease to the near-unityvalues expected from local observations. Such a\n``Decreasing Correlation Period'' (DCP), detected in N-body simulations under\ncertain conditions by several authors, is parametrised in a simple way, ending\nat a ``transition'' redshift $z_t.$ Consequences on $w_0,$ the amplitude of the\nangular correlation function of faint galaxies (for a fixed apparent magnitude\nrange), have been estimated. The sensitivity of $w_0$ to $z_t,$ and how this is\naffected by the redshift distribution of the galaxies in the sample, by low\nredshift spatial correlation function behaviour, by cosmology, and by the rate\nat which $\\xi_0$ decreases during the DCP, are shown and discussed. This simple\nmodel is intended as a first exploration of the effects of the DCP for a likely\nrange of parameter space. Comparison with the Hubble Deep Field (HDF) estimate\nof $w_0$ (Villumsen et al. 1996) indicates that the DCP is compatible with\nobservation for values of $z_t$ in the theoretically expected range $z_t\n\\gtapprox 1.$ However, tighter observational constraints on the HDF redshift\ndistribution and on low redshift correlation function growth will be needed\neither to detect the DCP unambiguously or to constrain $z_t$ to redshifts\ngreater than those of galaxies in existing surveys.",

Since Mg II is the dominant form of Mg in the\nneutral ISM and since Mg is expected to be a significant constituent of\ninterstellar dust grains, the far-UV lines are critical for assessing the role\nof this important element in the ISM. This study consists of complete component\nanalyses of the absorption along the lines of sight toward HD 93521 in the\nGalactic halo and Xi Per and Zeta Oph in the Galactic disk, including all four\nUV Mg II lines and numerous other transitions.

    "summary": "We present the results of the deepest optically identified X-ray survey yet\nmade. The X-ray survey was made with the ROSAT PSPC and reaches a flux limit of\n1.6x10^-15 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.5--2.0 keV). Above a flux limit of 2x10^-15 erg\ncm^-2 s^-1 we define a complete sample of 70 sources of which 59 are\nidentified. Some (5) other sources have tentative identifications and in a\nfurther 4 the X-ray error-boxes are blank to R=23 mag. At the brighter flux\nlevels (>= 10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1) we confirm the results of previous less deep\nX-ray surveys with 84% of the sources begin QSOs. At fainter fluxes, however,\nthe survey is dominated by a population of galaxies with narrow optical\nemission lines (NELGs). In addition, a number of groups and clusters of\ngalaxies are found at intermediate fluxes. Most of these are poor systems of\nlow X-ray luminosity and are generally found at redshifts of > 0.3. Their\nnumbers are consistent with a zero evolutionary scenario, in contrast to the\nsituation for high luminosity clusters at the same redshift. We discuss the\nsignificance of these results to the determination of the cosmic soft X-ray\nbackground (XRB) and show that at 2x10^-15 erg cm^-2 s^-1, we have resolved\nmore than 50% of the background. We also briefly consider the probable\nimportance of NELG objects to the residual background and look at some of the\nproperties of these unusual objects.",

    "summary": "The present paper presents a discussion of classification systems for\ngalaxies, with special emphasis on possible modifications of the Hubble \"tuning\nfork\" diagram, and on galaxy types not included in Hubble's original scheme.\nHubble's morphological types were defined in terms of standards observed at\nsmall look-back times that were mostly located in the field, or in poor\nclusters. It is pointed out that it is often difficult to shoehorn galaxies\nlocated in the cores of rich clusters, or objects viewed at large look-back\ntimes, into the Hubble classification system. The evolutionary relationships\nbetween E, S0 and dSph galaxies are presently still controversial and poorly\nunderstood. It is suggested that S0 galaxies may have arrived at their present\nmorphology along various evolutionary tracks. Late-type barred spirals are\nfound to be systematically less luminous than normal late-type galaxies. This\nsuggests that the dichotomy between normal and barred spirals may reflect\nsignificant differences in their evolutionary histories. Such differences might\nbe explored by searching for systematic differences between the [O/Fe] values\nin normal and barred spirals. Finally it is pointed out that the Large\nMagellanic Cloud may have been a low surface brightness galaxy for an ~8 Gyr\nperiod that ended 3-5 Gyr ago. This suggests that some galaxies can jump from\none morphological classification type to another.",

The two distance indicators give\nconsistent results, the relative distance moduli to Fornax and Coma with\nrespect to Virgo being Dmu(FV)=0.45+-0.15 and Dmu(CV)=3.55+-0.15) respectively.\nThe formal error on D(m-M) may be as small as 0.07 mag (~3% in distance),\nprovided that all the sources of bias are taken into account and a correct\nstatistical approach is used. Much of the actual uncertainty in the relative\ndistance of the clusters (12-15%), is due to the existence of systematic\ndepartures in the measurements of the velocity dispersions among the various\ndatasets, and to the corrections for aperture effects. The above result for the\nFornax cluster is supported by the L-sigma-mu relation and, with lesser\naccuracy, by the log(m)-log(re) relations. Our value of Dmu(FV) is in fair\nagreement with the one derived using planetary nebulae and SNe-Ia, while is in\nopen contrast with that coming from surface brightness fluctuations, globular\nclusters luminosity function, and infrared Tully-Fisher relation. In our data\nComa appears slightly nearer than indicated by the other distance indicators,\nbut now a better agreement with the Tully-Fisher relation seems to exist.\nFinally we found that there aren't correlations of the residuals of the\nDn-sigma with the effective surface brightness, the total luminosity of the\ngalaxies, with the ellipticity and the shape parameter a4. Instead a\ncorrelation seems to exists with maximum Vrot, with (V/sigma) and with the\nexponent m of the r^1/m fit to major axis light of galaxies.",

The requirement of consistency with the quantization of electric\ncharge observed in our Universe fixes a value of the, so far arbitrary,\nparameter e of the theory.

It is suggested that\nthe \"physical\" degrees of freedom, which explain the entropy $S^{BH}$, form\nonly a finite subset of the standard Rindler-like modes defined outside the\nblack hole horizon. The entropy $S_R$ of the Rindler modes, or entanglement\nentropy, is always ultraviolet divergent, while the entropy of the \"physical\"\nmodes is finite and it coincides in the induced gravity with $S^{BH}$. The two\nentropies $S^{BH}$ and $S_R$ differ by a surface integral Q interpreted as a\nNoether charge of non-minimally coupled scalar constituents of the model. We\ndemonstrate that energy E and Hamiltonian H of the fields localized in a part\nof space-time, restricted by the Killing horizon $\\Sigma$, differ by the\nquantity $T_H Q$, where $T_H$ is the temperature of a black hole. The first law\nof the black hole thermodynamics enables one to relate the probability\ndistribution of fluctuations of the black hole mass, caused by the quantum\nfluctuations of the fields, to the probability distribution of \"physical\" modes\nover energy E. The latter turns out to be different from the distribution of\nthe Rindler modes. We show that the probability distribution of the \"physical\"\ndegrees of freedom has a sharp peak at E=0 with the width proportional to the\nPlanck mass. The logarithm of number of \"physical\" states at the peak coincides\nexactly with the black hole entropy $S^{BH}$. It enables us to argue that the\nenergy distribution of the \"physical\" modes and distribution of the black hole\nmass are equivalent in the induced gravity. Finally it is shown that the\nNoether charge Q is related to the entropy of the low frequency modes\npropagating in the vicinity of the bifurcation surface $\\Sigma$ of the horizon.",

    "summary": "Brightness dependent correlations have been conclusively detected in the\naverage time profiles of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Determining the time\nconstants of the stretched exponential slopes of the average peak-aligned time\nprofile of GRBs as a function of the peak brightness, we find that the\npost-peak slope shows time dilation when comparing bright and dim bursts, while\nthe pre-peak slope hardly changes. Stronger bursts are thus more symmetric than\nweaker bursts at a high confidence level. The very weakest bursts have a\ndifferent shape (i.e., a different stretched exponential index) of their\naverage time profile as compared to brighter bursts. This difference is too\nlarge to be explained by trigger effects and Poisson noise. We interpret these\ncorrelations as being the result of an intrinsic positive correlation between\nbrightness and complexity of GRBs. This interpretation is directly confirmed by\nsimulations as well as by a morphological classification of bursts. The fact\nthat such a correlation can be observed should impose new constraints on the\ndistribution of GRBs over luminosity distance.",

The underlying matter model is a perfect\nfluid in the limit of vanishing pressure. The solution represents the\ngeneral-relativistic analogue of the classical Maclaurin disk. It was derived\nby applying solution techniques from soliton theory to the axisymmetric,\nstationary vacuum Einstein equations. In contrast to the Newtonian solution,\nthere exists an upper limit for the total mass of the disk - if the angular\nmomentum is fixed. At this limit, a transition to a rotating black hole, i.e.,\nto the Kerr solution occurs. Another limiting procedure leads to an interesting\ncosmological solution. These results prove conjectures formulated by Bardeen\nand Wagoner more than twenty-five years ago.",

Redshifts of these objects were predicted by Kneib et\nal. (1996) using a lensing analysis constrained by the properties of two bright\narcs of known redshift and other multiply-imaged sources. The new spectroscopic\nidentifications were obtained using long exposures with the LDSS-2 spectrograph\non the William Herschel Telescope and demonstrate the capability of that\ninstrument to new limits, $R\\simeq$24; the lensing magnification implies true\nsource magnitudes as faint as $R\\simeq$25. Statistically, our measured\nredshifts are in excellent agreement with those predicted from Kneib et al.'s\nlensing analysis which gives considerable support to the redshift distribution\nderived by the lensing inversion method for the more numerous and fainter\narclets extending to $R\\simeq 25.5$. We explore the remaining uncertainties\narising from both the mass distribution in the central regions of Abell 2218\nand the inversion method itself, and conclude that the mean redshift of the\nfaint field population at $R\\simeq$25.5 ($B\\sim 26$-27) is low, $<z>$=0.8-1.

Using the same I magnitudes with new widths derived from high-quality\nH-alpha rotation curves, we measure an RMS scatter of 0.14 mag in the TFR. This\nsuggests that measurement errors and ``astrophysical errors'' (such as\nnon-circular gas motion) on the H-alpha velocity widths are below 6%, and\noptical widths are nearly as good for TFR studies as 21-cm widths. The scatter\nand form of the TFR are found to be robust under choice of velocity\nwidth-extraction algorithm, as long as the central portions of the optical\nrotation curve are ignored and low-S/N points are not weighted too heavily. In\nthis small sample there is no evidence that rotation curve shapes vary\nsystematically with rotation velocity, nor that rotation curve shape can be\nused to reduce the scatter in the TFR.",

We first describe and test the\nadapted code against analytical results, laying the necessary foundations for\nsubsequent works on supersonic ambipolar diffusion, including C-type jets and\nshock instability.\n  The evolution away from jump shocks toward the numerous steady C-shock\nsub-types is then investigated. The evolution passes through four stages, which\npossess distinctive observational properties. The time scales and length scales\ncover broad ranges. Specific results are included for shock types including\nswitch, absorber, neutralised, oblique, transverse and intermediate. Only\nintermediate Type II shocks and `slow shocks', including switch-off shocks,\nremain as J-type under the low ion levels assumed. Other shocks transform via a\nsteadily growing neutral precursor to a diminishing jump. For neutralised\nshocks, this takes the form of an extended long-lived ramp.\n  Molecular hydrogen emission signatures are presented. After the jump speed\nhas dropped to under 25 km/s, a non-dissociative jump section can dominate the\nspectra for a long period. This produces a high-excitation spectrum. Once the\njump has further weakened, to < 8 km/s, the fully developed ion front is\nresponsible for brisk progress towards a constant C-type excitation.

    "summary": "The kinetic behavior of a three-dimensional off-lattice heteropolymer model\nis studied in terms of the time dependence of the average mean-square\ndisplacement between configurations. It is found that at short time-scales\nsimilar behavior is obtained even for sequences with very different\nthermodynamic properties. Furthermore, the degree of cooperativity in the\nfolding process is examined by studying the residual number of degrees of\nfreedom, obtained from an eigenvalue analysis of the correlation matrix,\ncontributing to the structural fluctuations. In the compact state, a gradual\ndecrease in this effective number of degrees of freedom take place as the\ntemperature is lowered. This can be interpreted as an increasing asymmetry of\nthe energy landscape.",

Its three instruments are\nprobing regions close to compact objects, degenerate dwarfs, neutron stars,\nstellar black holes and the central engines of AGN. Temporal studies with the\nASM and PCA have already yielded rich results which pertain to the environs,\nevolution, and nature of the compact objects in galactic systems. Here I review\nsome selected results from these instruments, as obtained by various RXTE\nobservers. The ASM is providing detailed light curves of about 60 detected\nsources and has uncovered new temporal/spectral states of galactic binary\nsystems. The bizarre behavior of the possibly very young binary system, Cir\nX-1, is being revealed in detail by both the ASM and the PCA. A rare high/soft\nstate of the black-hole candidate, Cyg X-1 provides new insight into the nature\nof the low/high transitions in black-hole binaries. The PCA has made possible\nthe discovery of oscillations near 1 kHz in ten low-mass X-ray binary systems.\nThese are most probably direct indicators of the neutron-star spin in some\ncases and probably indirect indicators in others. Studies of microquasars have\nunveiled a host of new temporal phenomena which may provide links between\naccretion processes and the radio jets in these systems.",

We find that the corrections are significant, of\norder 50% in the mass range of interest. We also calculate the leptoquark\naverage transverse momentum squared and find it to be rather small. Various\nleptoquark production cross sections at the Tevatron $p \\bar p$ collider are\nalso considered. We investigate in detail the leptoquark interpretation of the\nHERA data. First we assume a minimal leptoquark model with a single diagonal\nYukawa coupling to first family lepton and quark mass eigenstates only. In this\ncase constraints from atomic parity violating experiments allow only isodoublet\nscalar leptoquark production at HERA. This interpretation can be confirmed or\nruled out in the near future by high luminosity data at the Tevatron. The\nTevatron data already appear to rule out the vector leptoquark interpretation\nof the HERA data. We also consider a more general model which allows for all\npossible left-handed, right-handed, flavour and lepton number changing\ncouplings. The allowed values of the Yukawa couplings of this general model\noffer several different interpretations of the data which are radically\ndifferent from the minimal model solutions. However these somewhat ad hoc tuned\nsolutions can easily be tested by future HERA experiments.",

Only if the quantum measurement is\nfuzzy, continuous monitoring gives a readout E(t) from which information about\nthe dynamical development of the state vector of the system may be obtained in\ncertain cases. This is studied in detail. Fuzziness is thereby introduced with\nthe help of restricted path integrals equivalent to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.\nFor an otherwise undisturbed multilevel system it is shown that this\nmeasurement represents a model of decoherence. If it lasts long enough, the\nmeasurement readout discriminates between the energy levels and the von Neumann\nstate reduction is obtained. For a two-level system under resonance influence\n(which undergoes in absence of measurement Rabi oscillations between the\nlevels) different regimes of measurement are specified depending on its\nduration and fuzziness: 1) the Zeno regime where the measurement results in a\nfreezing of the transitions between the levels and 2) the Rabi regime when the\ntransitions maintain.

The color-octet production processes\ninclude 1) e^+e^- to J/\\psi g; 2) e^+e^- to j/psi q\\bar q. Of all these\nproduction channels, we find that the color-octet contributions dominate over\nthe color-singlet contributions at any energy scales. At low energies\n(\\sqrt{s}< 20 GeV), the dominant channel is e^+e^- to J/\\psi g whereas at high\nenergies e+e^- to j/psi q\\bar q will take the leading part. We also find that\nthe energy spectrum for the color-octet j/psi production in process e^+e^- to\nj/psi q\\bar q is very soft, and the mean energy of the produced j/psi is only\nabout 10 GeV~ 20 GeV even at very high energies (e.g. at 1000 GeV).

A possible\nnatural restriction on $|\\psi \\r$ is suggested and illustrated by two quantum\nmechanical examples based on a simple perturbed harmonic oscillator\nHamiltonian. The proposed alternative quantum weak energy condition is applied\nto states formed by the action of scalar, vector and the energy momentum tensor\noperators on the vacuum. We assume conformal invariance in order to determine\nalmost uniquely three-point functions involving the energy momentum tensor in\nterms of a few parameters. The positivity conditions lead to non trivial\ninequalities for these parameters. They are satisfied in free field theories,\nexcept in one case for dimensions close to two. Further restrictions on $|\\psi\n\\r$ are suggested which remove this problem. The inequalities which follow from\nconsidering the state formed by applying the energy momentum tensor to the\nvacuum are shown to imply that the coefficient of the topological term in the\nexpectation value of the trace of the energy momentum tensor in an arbitrary\ncurved space background is positive, in accord with calculations in free field\ntheories.",

    "summary": "The detection of gravitational waves from coalescing compact binaries would\nbe a computationally intensive process if a single bank of template wave forms\n(i.e., a one step search) is used. In an earlier paper we had presented a\ndetection strategy, called a two step search}, that utilizes a hierarchy of\ntemplate banks. It was shown that in the simple case of a family of Newtonian\nsignals, an on-line two step search was about 8 times faster than an on-line\none step search (for initial LIGO). In this paper we extend the two step search\nto the more realistic case of zero spin 1.5 post-Newtonian wave forms. We also\npresent formulas for detection and false alarm probabilities which take\nstatistical correlations into account. We find that for the case of a 1.5\npost-Newtonian family of templates and signals, an on-line two step search\nrequires about 1/21 the computing power that would be required for the\ncorresponding on-line one step search. This reduction is achieved when signals\nhaving strength S = 10.34 are required to be detected with a probability of\n0.95, at an average of one false event per year, and the noise power spectral\ndensity used is that of advanced LIGO. For initial LIGO, the reduction achieved\nin computing power is about 1/27 for S = 9.98 and the same probabilities for\ndetection and false alarm as above.",

The LDA\nand the linear-response full-potential LMTO method were used. In the\nequilibrium structure, oxygen is found to buckle slightly out of the plane and,\nas a result, the characters of the energy bands near EF are found to be similar\nto those of other optimally doped HTSCs. For the EPI we find lambda(s)=0.4, in\naccord with previous LDA calculations for YBa2Cu3O7. This supports the common\nbelief that the EPI mechanism alone is insufficient to explain HTSC.\nLambda(x^2-y^2) is found to be positive and nearly as large as lambda(s). This\nis surprising and indicates that the EPI could enhance some other d-wave\npairing mechanism. Like in YBa2Cu3O7, the buckling modes contribute\nsignificantly to the EPI, although these contributions are proportional to the\nstatic buckling and would vanish for flat planes. These numerical results can\nbe understood from a generic tight-binding model originally derived from the\nLDA bands of YBa2Cu3O7. In the future, the role of anharmonicity of the\nbuckling-modes and the influence of the spin-fluctuations should be\ninvestigated.",

The bulk Lorentz factor of the radio jets\nis much smaller than the Lorentz factors of the emitting particles requiring in\nsitu particle acceleration such as Fermi acceleration at shocks.

    "summary": "The lattice instabilities of perovskite structure oxides are responsible for\nmany of their interesting properties, such as temperature-dependent\nferroelectric phase transitions. First-principles calculations using linear\nresponse theory provide an accurate means to determine the lattice dynamics\nthroughout the entire Brillouin zone (BZ). Using the LAPW linear response\nmethod, we have previously carried out such a study on ferroelectric KNbO3. We\npresent here the results of a similar investigation for cubic SrTiO3. While\nKNbO3 has only ferroelectric-type instabilities, SrTiO3 exhibits both\nferroelectric (FE) and antiferrodistortive (AFD) instabilities. We correctly\npredict the known instability at the R-point in the BZ, which is responsible\nfor the AFD phase transition to the tetragonal structure at about 105 K.\nFurthermore, the phase space of the ferroelectric instability is greatly\nreduced compared to KNbO3. Antiferrodistortive instabilities exist in\none-dimensional cylindrical tubes extending along the entire R-M-R line in the\nBZ. The essentially 1-D character of these tubes corresponds to real space\nplanar instabilities characterized by rotations of oxygen octahedra.",

Spectra for dots\ncontaining <200 electrons reveal a surprising feature. Electron additions are\nnot evenly spaced in gate voltage. Rather, they group into bunches. With\nincreasing electron number the bunching evolves from occurring randomly to\nperiodically at about every fifth electron. The periodicity of the bunching and\nfeatures in electron tunneling rates suggest that the bunching is associated\nwith electron additions into spatially distinct regions within the dots.",

To explain these discrepancies we derive a\nstochastic growth equation that describes the evolution of surfaces eroded by\nion bombardment. The coefficients appearing in the equation can be calculated\nexplicitly in terms of the physical parameters characterizing the sputtering\nprocess. Exploring the connection between the ion-sputtering problem and the\nKardar-Parisi-Zhang and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations, we find that\nmorphological transitions may take place when experimental parameters, such as\nthe angle of incidence of the incoming ions or their average penetration depth,\nare varied. Furthermore, the discussed methods allow us to calculate\nanalytically the ion-induced surface diffusion coefficient, that can be\ncompared with experiments. Finally, we use numerical simulations of a one\ndimensional sputtering model to investigate certain aspects of the ripple\nformation and roughening.",

In the weak coupling limit, the\ndivisor of this automorphic form is an integer linear combination of the\nrational quadratic divisors where the gauge symmetry is enhanced classically.\nWe also show how the non-perturbative prepotential can be expressed in terms of\nmeromorphic automorphic forms, by expanding a T-duality invariant quantity both\nin terms of the standard special coordinates and in terms of the invariant\ndilaton and the covariant coordinates.",
