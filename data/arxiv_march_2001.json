    "summary": "The 3X+1 function T(n) is (3n+1)/2 if n is odd and n/2 if n is even. The\ntotal stopping time \\sigma_\\infty (n) for a positive integer n is the number of\niterations of the 3x+1 function to reach 1 starting from n, and is \\infty if 1\nis never reached. The 3x+1 conjecture states that this function is finite. We\nshow that infinitely many n have a finite total stopping time with\n\\sigma_\\infty(n) > 6.14316 log n. The proof uses a very large computation. It\nis believed that almost all positive integers have \\sigma_\\infty (n) > 6.95212\n\\log n. The method of the paper should extend to prove infinitely many integers\nhave this property, but it would require a much larger computation.",

Also, the quality and\nquantity of knowledge gain depend strongly on the type of monitoring scheme. We\ncompare five different detection schemes (direct, adaptive, homodyne of the $x$\nquadrature, homodyne of the $y$ quadrature, and heterodyne) using four\ndifferent measures of the knowledge gain (Shannon information about $\\Omega$,\nvariance in $\\Omega$, long-time system purity, and short-time system purity).",

    "summary": "If the critical current density Jc is very high for a superconductor, then\nestimating its value from transport measurements is not very easy. In such\ncases, the value of Jc, called Jcm for magnetic Jc, is usually obtained from\nthe measured magnetic hysteresis loop measurements by using a proper critical\nstate model such as Bean's model (ref. 1). However, for bulk polycrystalline\nhigh temperature superconductors, the values of Jcm are much higher than the\nvalues, Jct, obtained from the transport measurements. This is due to the fact\nthat the Jct is interrupted by weakly linked grain boundaries. However, for the\nrecently discovered superconductor MgB2 (ref. 2), the grain boundary effect is\nnegligible and these two values seem to coincide. Moreover, Jc increases\ndrastically with decreasing the temperature. Consequently, the critical current\ndensities for bulk wires can be very high, suggesting that numerous\napplications for the power transport. In this letter, we report the origin of\nthe large current carrying capability of MgB2 based on direct measurements of\nthe current-voltage relation in high magnetic fields. A strong coupling between\nthe grains may be one reason for the absence of the weak link effect. Another\nreason may be the fact that, instead of a weak pinning mechanism such as\nthermally activated flux hopping, strong pinning due to a vortex glass phase is\nfound in this material. The vortex phase diagram obtained from transport\nmeasurements shows that, in H-T space, a wide region below the Hc2 line is\ncovered by a vortex glass phase.",

Many\nnoisy signals in real systems display trends, so that the scaling results\nobtained from the DFA method become difficult to analyze. We systematically\nstudy the effects of three types of trends -- linear, periodic, and power-law\ntrends, and offer examples where these trends are likely to occur in real data.\nWe compare the difference between the scaling results for artificially\ngenerated correlated noise and correlated noise with a trend, and study how\ntrends lead to the appearance of crossovers in the scaling behavior. We find\nthat crossovers result from the competition between the scaling of the noise\nand the ``apparent'' scaling of the trend. We study how the characteristics of\nthese crossovers depend on (i) the slope of the linear trend; (ii) the\namplitude and period of the periodic trend; (iii) the amplitude and power of\nthe power-law trend and (iv) the length as well as the correlation properties\nof the noise. Surprisingly, we find that the crossovers in the scaling of noisy\nsignals with trends also follow scaling laws -- i.e. long-range power-law\ndependence of the position of the crossover on the parameters of the trends. We\nshow that the DFA result of noise with a trend can be exactly determined by the\nsuperposition of the separate results of the DFA on the noise and on the trend,\nassuming that the noise and the trend are not correlated. If this superposition\nrule is not followed, this is an indication that the noise and the superimposed\ntrend are not independent, so that removing the trend could lead to changes in\nthe correlation properties of the noise.",

    "summary": "Spin-polarized band calculations for supercells of SrB$_{6}$, where a La-,\nIn- or Al- impurity or a vacancy is replacing one Sr, are performed within the\nlocal spin density approximation. Moderately large cells with 8 formula units\n(56 atoms) are studied for all dopings and large ones with 27 formula units\n(189 atoms) for the case of La-doping. The undoped system has a vanishing\ndensity-of-states (DOS) at the Fermi energy (E$_F$), while the additional La-d\nband makes E$_F$ to enter the bands above the gap. An Al (or In) impurity has\nthe opposite effect, with a rigid-band like shift of E_F to below the gap. In\nthe former case, the addition of a d-electron makes a local, impurity-like\nmodification of the electronic structure close to the La atom. As has been\nshown in a previous publication, it can lead to a weak ferromagnetic state.\nThis result is shown to persist at even lower doping, by the 189-atom cell\ncalculations, with a moment of the order 0.1 $\\mu_B$ per La impurity. An\naddition of a p-electron, by an In-impurity, makes no similar effect. The\nmagnetic state can be understood from a charge transfer and an additional gain\nin potential energy, as a spin-splitting is imposed. Different models with\nmodified localization of the La-band are made in order to show the correlation\nbetween charge transfer and the size of the magnetic moment.",

The Sommerfeld constant gamma=0.89+-0.05 mJ/K^2/gat (2.7 mJ/K^2/mol) is\ndetermined in the normal state above Hc2. The normal- and superconducting state\nentropies are equal at Tc.

The scalar is also a potential for the gravity acceleration\nvector. Motion is governed by an extension of the special-relativistic form of\nNewton's second law.

We detect a broad emission bump centered at ~1445A and\npresent throughout the entire binary orbit, and a second bump near ~1650A,\nwhich appears only near the inferior conjunction of the secondary star.

Combining our data\nwith that in the literature, we have a close-to-complete census of Li\nabundances for late-type stars with Mv < 5.8. These data show that the\nLi-depletion pattern in Coma Ber is similar, but not identical, to that in the\nHyades cluster, which has a similar age but higher metallicity. Several Coma\nBer F stars have suffered significantly more Li depletion than their\ncounterparts in the Hyades. The G and early-K stars of Coma Ber have undergone\nless Li depletion than those of the Hyades, but much more than that predicted\nby standard evolutionary models featuring only convective mixing. This provides\nstrong evidence for additional mixing and Li depletion operating in these stars\nduring their first 400Myr on the main sequence, amounting to 0.3 dex at 6000K\nand rising to 0.8-1.2 dex at 5400K. We find that 4 of the radial-velocity\nnon-members are among a small number of low-mass stars which were previously\nreported as part of an extra-tidal moving group associated with the Coma Ber\ncluster. As a result we now find that the luminosity function of this moving\ngroup is indistinguishable from that of the central cluster. It is uncertain\nwhether there may be a significant number of stars with even lower masses among\nthe moving group.",

The low gravity\nproblem can be largely explained by the radiative levitation of Fe in the\natmospheres of the blue HB stars. We show that the onset of radiative\nlevitation and the drop in HB rotation velocities at Teff ~ 11,000 K coincide\nwith the disappearance of surface convection. The low rotation velocities of\nthe hotter HB stars may be due to the spin down of the surface layers by a weak\nstellar wind induced by the radiative levitation of Fe.

The correction factor (defined to be the ratio of the line\nflux that would be observed neglecting scattering, to the actual observed line\nflux) is a function of position within the filament. For sufficiently large\nregions that include crisp edges as well as more diffuse regions of the\nfilament structure, the CIV and NV correction factors are between about 1.5 and\n3.5 (and the CIV correction factor is invariably larger than the NV correction\nfactor). The correction factors have a larger range when smaller regions are\nconsidered. The CIV correction factor is about 6 at the filament edges, while\nthe NV correction factor is about 4.

Calculating nh from the parabolic Tc(nh)\nbehavior, the features coalesce for all samples at nh=0.11 and nh=0.175,\nirrespective of substitution and doping. Hence, this behavior seems to reflect\nan intrinsic property of the CuO2 planes. Analyzing our results we obtain\ndifferent mechanisms in three doping regions: Tc changes in the optimally doped\nand overdoped region are mainly caused by charge transfer. In the slightly\nunderdoped region an increasing contribution to dTc/dp is obtained when well\nordered CuO chain fragments serve as pinning centers for stripes. This behavior\nis supported by our results on Zn doped NdBa2Cu3Ox and is responsible for the\nwell known dTc/dp peak observed in YBa2Cu3Ox at x=6.7.

On a single-layer honeycomb lattice, a paramagnetic\nto AF phase transition occurs at a finite value of the repulsion energy $U_c/t\n\\simeq 3.6$, due to the loss of the density of states at the fermi level. On a\nlayered honeycomb lattice, however, inter-layer hopping term creates a perfect\nnesting of the fermi surface, and leads the AF with $U_c=0$.

    "summary": "This paper reexamines the physical roles of trapped and passing electrons in\nelectron Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal (BGK) solitary waves, also called the BGK\nphase space electron holes (EH). It is shown that the charge density variation\nin the vicinity of the solitary potential is a net balance of the negative\ncharge from trapped electrons and positive charge due to the decrease of the\npassing electron density. A BGK EH consists of electron density enhancements as\nwell as a density depletion, instead of only the density depletion as\npreviously thought. The shielding of the positive core is not a thermal\nscreening by the ambient plasma, but achieved by trapped electrons oscillating\ninside the potential energy trough. The total charge of a BGK EH is therefore\nzero. Two separated EHs do not interact and the concept of negative mass is not\nneeded. These features are independent of the strength of the nonlinearity. BGK\nEHs do not require thermal screening, and their size is thus not restricted to\nbe greater than the Debye length $\\lambda_D$. Our analysis predicts that BGK\nEHs smaller than $\\lambda_D$ can exist. A width($\\delta$)-amplitude($\\psi$)\nrelation of an inequality form is obtained for BGK EHs in general. For\nempty-centered EHs with potential amplitude $\\gg 1$, we show that the\nwidth-amplitude relation of the form $\\delta\\propto\\sqrt{\\psi}$ is common to\nbell-shaped potentials. For $\\psi\\ll 1$, the width approaches zero faster than\n$\\sqrt{\\psi}$.",

For the system to demonstrate experimentally certain non-classical\nbehavior, rho cannot be in S, a closed convex set of densities whose extreme\npoints have a specificed tensor product form. Two mathematical problems in the\nquantum computing literature arise from this context: (1) the determination\nwhether a given rho is in S and (2) a measure of the ``entanglement'' of such a\nrho in terms of its distance from S. In this paper we describe these two\nproblems in detail for a linear algebra audience, discuss some recent results\nfrom the quantum computing literature, and prove some new results.We emphasize\nthe roles of densities rho as both operators on the Hilbert space H[N] and also\nas points in a real Hilbert space M. We are able to compute the nearest\nseparable densities tau0 to rho0 in particular classes of inseparable densities\nand we use the Euclidean distance between the two in M to quantify the\nentanglement of rho0.

A high temperature\nexpansion is employed to map special anisotropic high dimensional models into\nlower dimensional variants. We show that it is possible to have an effective\nreduction in the dimension without the need of compactifying some dimensions.\nThese models are frustrated and display a symmetry intermediate between local\nand global gauge symmetries. Some solutions are presented. Our dimensional\nreductions are a generlization of the trivial dimensional reduction that occur\nin pure two dimensional gauge theories. It will be further seen that the\nabsence of a ``phase interference'' effect plays an important role in high\ndimensional problems. By identifying another (``permutational'') symmetry\npresent in the large n limit, we will further show how to generally map global\nhigh dimensional spin systems onto a one dimensional chain and discuss\nimplications.",

    "summary": "We report on ASCA, RXTE, and archival observations of the high mass X-ray\nbinary pulsar 4U1907+09. Spectral measurements of the absorption and flux were\nmade at all phases of the X-ray pulsar orbit, including the first spectral\nmeasurements of an extended period of low flux during two of the ASCA\nobservations. We find that a simple spherical wind model can fit the time\naveraged light curve as measured by the RXTE ASM, but does not fit the observed\nchanges in the absorption column or account for the existence of the\nphase-locked secondary flare. An additional model component consisting of a\ntrailing stream can account for the variations in column depth. However, these\nmodels favor a high inclination angle for the system, suggesting a companion\nmass more consistent with an identification as a Be-star. In this case an\nequatorially enhanced wind and inclined neutron star orbit may be a more\nappropriate interpretation of the data.",

    "summary": "The Hipparcos Intermediate Astrometric Data for carbon stars have been\nreprocessed using an algorithm which provides an objective criterion for\nrejecting anomalous data points and constrains the parallax to be positive. New\nparallax solutions have been derived for 317 cool carbon stars, mostly of types\nR and N. In this paper we discuss the results for the R stars. The most\nimportant result is that the early R stars (i.e., R0 - R3) have absolute\nmagnitudes and V-K colors locating them among red clump giants in the\nHertzsprung-Russell diagram. Stars with subtypes R4 - R9 tend to be cooler and\nhave similar luminosity to the N-type carbon stars, as confirmed by their\nposition in the (J-H, H-K) color-color diagram. The sample of early R-type\nstars selected from the Hipparcos Catalogue appears to be approximately\ncomplete to magnitude K_0 ~ 7, translating into a completeness distance of 600\npc if all R stars had M_K= -2 (400 pc if M_K= -1). With about 30 early R-type\nstars in that volume, they comprise about 0.04% (0.14% for M_K= -1) of the red\nclump stars in the solar neighborhood. Identification with the red clump\nlocates these stars at the helium core burning stage of stellar evolution,\nwhile the N stars are on the asymptotic giant branch, where helium shell\nburning occurs. The present analysis suggests that for a small fraction of the\nhelium core burning stars (far lower than the fraction of helium shell-burning\nstars), carbon produced in the interior is mixed to the atmosphere in\nsufficient quantities to form a carbon star.",

Charge inversion\nvanishes every time the top layer of counterions is completely full and becomes\nincompressible. These oscillations of charge inversion are confirmed by\nMonte-Carlo simulations. Another version of this phenomenon is studied for a\nmetallic electrode screened by multivalent counterions when potential of the\nelectrode is controlled instead of its charge.

Since the 1970s many authors have\ntried to generalize this geometrical model of the physical space-time by\nintroducing torsion and even more general metric-affine geometry. In this paper\nwe discuss status of torsion in the theory of gravity. At first, we emphasize\nthat up to now we have no experimental evidence for the existence of torsion in\nNature.

Many physicist have regarded this\nrenunciation of our effort to describe nature herself as premature, and John\nvon Neumann reformulated quantum theory as a theory of an evolving objective\nuniverse interacting with human consciousness. This interaction is associated\nboth in Copenhagen quantum theory and in von Neumann quantum theory with a\nsudden change that brings the objective physical state of a system in line with\na subjectively felt psychical reality. The objective physical state is thereby\nconverted from a material substrate to an informational and dispositional\nsubstrate that carries both the information incorporated into it by the\npsychical realities, and certain dispositions for the occurrence of future\npsychical realities. The present work examines and proposes solutions to two\nproblems that have appeared to block the development of this conception of\nnature. The first problem is how to reconcile this theory with the principles\nof relativistic quantum field theory; the second problem is to understand\nwhether, strictly within quantum theory, a person's mind can affect the\nactivities of his brain, and if so how. Solving the first problem involves\nresolving a certain nonlocality question. The proposed solution to the second\nproblem is based on a postulated connection between effort, attention, and the\nquantum Zeno effect. This solution explains on the basis of quantum physics a\nlarge amount of heretofore unexplained data amassed by psychologists.",

    "summary": "The numerical solutions of nonlocal and local Boltzmann kinetic equations for\nthe simulation of peripheral and central heavy ion reactions are compared. The\nexperimental finding of enhancement of mid-rapidity matter shows the necessity\nto include nonlocal corrections. While the in-medium cross section changes the\nnumber of collisions and not the transferred energy, the nonlocal scenario\nchanges the energy transferred during collisions. The renormalisation of\nquasiparticle energies by using the Pauli-rejected collisions leads to a\nfurther enhancement of mid-rapidity matter distribution and is accompanied by a\ndynamical softening of the equation of state.\n  The simulation results are parameterised in terms of time dependent\nthermodynamical variables in the Fermi liquid sense. This allows one to discuss\ndynamical trajectories in phase space. A combination of thermodynamical\nobservables is constructed which locates instabilities and points of possible\nphase transition under iso-nothing conditions. Two different mechanisms of\ninstability, a short time surface-dominated instability and later a\nspinodal-dominated volume instability is found. The latter one occurs only if\nthe incident energies do not exceed significantly the Fermi energy and might be\nattributed to spinodal decomposition.",

At zero temperature the induced fermion numbers for these two\ncases are very similar, but at finite temperature they are very different. The\nsigma model case is generic and the induced fermion number is nontopological,\nbut the kink case is special and the fermion number is topological, even at\nfinite temperature.

The collapse is studied\nusing a general relativistic hydrodynamics code. The coupled system of Einstein\nand fluid equations is solved employing observer time coordinates, by foliating\nthe spacetime by means of outgoing null hypersurfaces. The code contains an\nequation of state which includes effects due to radiation, electrons and\nbaryons, and detailed microphysics to account for electron-positron pairs. In\naddition energy losses by thermal neutrino emission are included. We are able\nto follow the collapse of SMS from the onset of instability up to the point of\nblack hole formation. Several SMS with masses in the range $5\\times 10^5\nM_{\\odot}- 10^9 M_{\\odot}$ are simulated. In all models an apparent horizon\nforms initially, enclosing the innermost 25% of the stellar mass. From the\ncomputed neutrino luminosities, estimates of the energy deposition by\n$\\nu\\bar{\\nu}$-annihilation are obtained. Only a small fraction of this energy\nis deposited near the surface of the star, where, as proposed recently by\nFuller & Shi (1998), it could cause the ultrarelativistic flow believed to be\nresponsible for $\\gamma$-ray bursts. Our simulations show that for collapsing\nSMS with masses larger than $5\\times 10^5 M_{\\odot}$ the energy deposition is\nat least two orders of magnitude too small to explain the energetics of\nobserved long-duration bursts at cosmological redshifts. In addition, in the\nabsence of rotational effects the energy is deposited in a region containing\nmost of the stellar mass. Therefore relativistic ejection of matter is\nimpossible.",

The new interaction transfers part of the\nprimary particle's energy to modes which do not trigger the experimental\narragement (neutrinos, lightest supersymmetric particle, gravitons) thus\nunderestimating its true energy. We show that this underestimate leads\nnaturally to the observed break (the \"knee\") in the inferred cosmic ray\nspectrum. The suggestion we advance fits nicely to current theoretical\nextensions of the Standard Model (supersymmetry, technicolor, low scale\ngravity) where new physics at the TeV scale manifests with the distinct\nsignature of missing energy. We present a simple model where the new physics\nproceeds via gluon fusion and assuming a single power law for the galactic (E ~\n10^{18.5} eV) cosmic ray spectrum, we produce a good fit to the data in the\n10^{14}-10^{18.5} eV range.

The\npseudogap arises from the resonance scattering due to the strong\nsuperconducting fluctuations.\n  First, the electronic state and the anti-ferromagnetic spin fluctuations are\ncalculated by using the FLEX approximation. The T-matrix (the propagator of the\nsuperconducting fluctuations) is calculated by extending the $\\acute{{\\rm\nE}}$liashberg equation. The self-energy due to the superconducting fluctuations\nis calculated by the T-matrix approximation. The pseudogap is shown in the\nsingle particle properties and the magnetic properties by the microscopic\ncalculation. A comprehensive explanation of the doping dependence of the\npseudogap is obtained. Furthermore, we apply the theory to the electron-doped\ncuprates and obtain the consistent results with the recent experiments.\nFinally, the self-consistent calculation for the spin fluctuations,\nsuperconducting fluctuations and the single particle properties are carried out\nwithin the FLEX and the self-consistent T-matrix approximations. The calculated\nsuperconducting critical temperature $T_{{\\rm c}}$ is remarkably reduced from\nthe results of the mean field (FLEX) calculation.

In\nthis article the basic assumptions are discussed which underlie those features.\nIt is shown that these basic assumptions - though universally assumed up the\nbeginnings of the XX century - are far from being obvious. Finally it is shown\nthat - to a certain extent - there is nothing wrong in assuming these basic\npostulates. Rather, the error lies in the epistemological absolutization of the\ntheory, which was considered as a mirroring of Nature.",

    "summary": "Cosmic ray antiprotons provide an important probe for the study of the\ngalactic Dark Matter, as they could be produced by exotic sources. On the other\nhand, antiprotons are anyway produced by standard nuclear reactions of cosmic\nray nuclei on interstellar matter. This process is responsible for a background\nflux that must be carefully determined to estimate the detectability of an\nhypothetical exotic signal. Estimates of this background suffer from potential\nuncertainties of various origins. The propagation of cosmic antiprotons depends\non several physical characteristics of the Galaxy which are poorly known.\nAntiprotons are created from cosmic protons and helium nuclei whose fluxes were\nnot measured with great accuracy until very recently. Calculations of\nantiproton fluxes make use of nuclear physics models with their own\nshortcomings and uncertainties. The goal of this paper is to give a new\nevaluation of the cosmic antiproton flux along with the associated\nuncertainties. The propagation parameters were tightly constrained in Maurin et\nal. 2001 by an analysis of cosmic ray nuclei data in the framework of a\ntwo-zone diffusion model and we apply these parameters to the propagation of\nantiprotons. We use the recently published data on proton and helion fluxes,\nand we find that this particular source of uncertainty has become negligible.\nThe Monte Carlo program DTUNUC was used to carefully examine nuclear reactions.\nWe find that all the cosmic antiproton fluxes naturally coming out of the\ncalculation are fully compatible with experimental data. Uncertainties in this\nflux have been strongly reduced. Those related to propagation are less than\n25%. All other possible sources of uncertainty have also been studied.",

This latter is ~2% effect for photons near the\npeak of the photon energy distribution at z=800 and a ~0.2% effect at z=1100.\nIncluding Rayleigh scattering in the calculation reduces Silk damping at fixed\nredshift, alters the position of the surface of last scattering and alters the\npropagation of acoustic waves. We estimate the amplitude of these effects. For\nthe Microwave Anisotropy Probe (MAP), Rayleigh scattering increases the\nanisotropy spectrum by 0.1% at the most. For the highest frequencies of the\nPlanck Surveyor, the effects of Rayleigh scattering are much more dramatic\n(decreasing the anisotropy spectrum by 3% at \\nu~550GHz and l~1000). The\nrelative difference between the spectra of low and high frequencies is imposed\nby an oscillation with a function of multipole l and the oscillation amplitude\nis up to 0.5% between 100 and 550GHz. Rayleigh scattering also slows the\ndecoupling between radiation and matter, but the effect is undetectably small.",

Starting with the observed optical luminosity\nfunctions for elliptical galaxies, it is shown that the probability of an\nelliptical forming a radio source is a continuous, increasing function of\noptical luminosity, precisely proportional to square of the optical luminosity\nof the galaxy. Once the probability function is fixed, the luminosity function\nof normal elliptical galaxies is used as input for Monte Carlo simulations that\nreproduce the distribution of radio galaxies in the radio-optical luminosity\nplane. Our results show that radio galaxies are luminosity biased, but\notherwise random sample of elliptical galaxies. This unified view of radio and\nnon-radio ellipticals also explains the well known difference of 0.5 mag in\naverage optical luminosity between FRI and FRII radio galaxies as a simple\nselection effect. Specifically, FRII appear preferentially in smaller galaxies\nbecause both radio and optical luminosity functions are steep, so there is a\nnegligible probability of observing a powerful radio source associated with a\nbright galaxy; no intrinsic physical differences between FRI and FRII host\ngalaxies is required.",

We use a path\nintegral approach for a corresponding supersymmetric quantum mechanical model.\nWeyl ordering the corresponding Hamiltonian in phase space, an extra two-loop\ncounterterm ${1/8}\\bigg(R + g^{ij} \\Gamma^{l}_{k i} \\Gamma^{k}_{l j} \\bigg)$ is\nproduced in the action. Applying a recursive method we evaluate the components\nof the metric tensor in Riemann normal coordinates in six dimensions and\nconstruct the interaction Langrangian density by employing the background field\nmethod.\n  The calculation of the anomaly is based on the end-point scalar propagator\nand not on the string inspired center-of-mass propagator which gives incorrect\nresults for the local trace anomaly. The manipulation of the Feynman diagrams\nis partly relied on the factorization of four dimensional subdiagrams and\npartly on a brute force computer algebra program developed to serve this\nspecific purpose. The computer program enables one to perform index\ncontractions of twelve quantum fields (10395 in the present case) a task which\ncannot be accomplished otherwise. We observe that the contribution of the\ndisconnected diagrams is no longer proportional to the two dimensional trace\nanomaly (which vanishes in four dimensions). The integrated trace anomaly is\nfinally expressed in terms of the 17 linearly independent scalar monomials\nconstructed out of covariant derivatives and Riemann tensors.",

Our studies revealed that the nature of the transition\nbetween the two regimes, i.e. the behaviour of $t_f$ at the critical load\n$sigma_c$, strongly depends on the range of load sharing: for global load\nsharing $t_f$ has a power law divergence at $\\sigma_c$ with a universal\nexponent of 0.5, however, for local load sharing the transition becomes abrupt:\nat the critical load $t_f$ jumps to a finite value, analogous to second and\nfirst order phase transitions, respectively.

Using an extension of the Keldysh Green's function\nmethod we are able to find the full distribution of charge transfers for all\ntemperatures and voltages. For the non-Gaussian regime, we show that the\nequilibrium current fluctuations are enhanced by the presence of the\nsuperconductor. We predict an enhancement of the nonequilibrium current noise\nfor temperatures below and voltages of the order of the Thouless energy\nE_Th=D/L^2. Our calculation fully accounts for the proximity effect in the\nnormal metal and agrees with experimental data. We demonstrate that the\ncalculation of the full current statistics is in fact simpler than a concrete\ncalculation of the noise.",

Initially localised quantum states spread\nexponentially to the system dimension when the classical dynamics are chaotic.\nThe long-time behaviour of the quantum probability distributions and, in\nparticular, the parameter-dependent rates of relaxation to the equilibrium\nstate are surprisingly well approximated by the classical Liouville mechanics\neven for small quantum numbers. As the accessible classical phase space becomes\npredominantly chaotic, the classical and quantum probability equilibrium\nconfigurations approach the microcanonical distribution, although the quantum\nequilibrium distributions exhibit characteristic `minimum' fluctuations away\nfrom the microcanonical state. The magnitudes of the quantum-classical\ndifferences arising from the equilibrium quantum fluctuations are studied for\nboth pure and mixed (dynamically entangled) quantum states. In both cases the\nstandard deviation of these fluctuations decreases as $(\\hbar/{\\mathcal\nJ})^{1/2}$, where ${\\mathcal J}$ is a measure of the system size. In\nconclusion, under a variety of conditions the differences between quantum and\nclassical Liouville mechanics are shown to become vanishingly small in the\nclassical limit (${\\mathcal J}/\\hbar \\to \\infty$) of a non-dissipative model\nendowed with only a few degrees of freedom.",

The non-linear optical\nproperties of polydiacetylene are considered, which are determined by the\nthird-order susceptibility.

For short chains, the\ncalculated E(1Bu) agrees with the experimental value, within solvation effects\n(ca. 0.3 eV). The charge gap is used to characterise bound and unbound states.\nThe nBu is above the charge gap and hence a continuum state; the 1Bu, 2Ag and\nmAg are not and hence are bound excitons. For large chain lengths, the nBu\ntends towards the charge gap as expected, strongly suggesting that the nBu is\nthe conduction band edge. The conduction band edge for PDA is agreed in the\nliterature to be ca. 3.0 eV. Accounting for the strong polarisation effects of\nthe medium and polaron formation gives our calculated E(nBu) ca. 3.6 eV, with\nan exciton binding energy of ca. 1.0 eV. The 2Ag state is found to be above the\n1Bu, which does not agree with relaxed transition experimental data. However,\nthis could be resolved by including explicit lattice relaxation in the Pariser-\nParr-Pople-Peierls model.

On the other hand, a\nslight suppression in large-angle temperature correlations in such models\nexplains rather naturally the observed anomalously low quadrupole which is\nincompatible with the prediction of the \"standard\"\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker-Lemaitre models. Interestingly, moreover, the\ndevelopment in the astronomical observation technology has made it possible to\ndirectly explore the imprint of the non-trivial topology by looking for\nidentical objects so called \"ghosts\" in wide separated directions. For the CMB\ntemperature fluctuations identical patterns would appear on a pair of circles\nin the sky. Another interesting feature is the non-Gaussianity in the\ntemperature fluctuations.

By studying the second variations of the free energy,\nwe find that instability sets in precisely at the point of minimum temperature\nin agreement with the theorem of Katz [ Mon. Not. R. astr.

The perturbation that induces instability at this point is calculated\nexplicitly; it has not a ``core-halo'' structure contrary to what happens in\nthe microcanonical ensemble. We also study Jeans type gravitational instability\nof isothermal gaseous spheres described by Navier-Stokes equations. We show\nanalytically the equivalence between dynamical stability and thermodynamical\nstability and the fact that the stability of isothermal gas spheres does not\ndepend on the viscosity. This confirms the findings of Semelin et al.\n[astro-ph/9908073] who used numerical methods. We also give a simpler\nderivation of the geometric hierarchy of scales inducing instability discovered\nby these authors. The density profiles that trigger these instabilities are\ncalculated analytically; they present more and more oscillations that also\nfollow a geometric progression. This suggests that the system will fragmentate\nin a series of `clumps' and that these `clumps' will themselves fragmentate in\nsubstructures. The fact that both the domain sizes leading to instability and\nthe `clumps' sizes within a box follow a geometric progression with the same\nratio suggests a fractal-like behaviour.

We suggest that iron nuclei may be\naccelerated in the outer gaps of pulsars, and then suffer partial\nphoto-disintegration in the non-thermal radiation fields of the outer gaps. As\na result, protons, neutrons, and surviving heavier nuclei are injected into the\nexpanding supernova remnant. We compute the spectra of nuclei escaping from\nsupernova remnants into the interstellar medium, taking into account the\nobserved population of radio pulsars.\n  Our calculations, which include a realistic model for acceleration and\npropagation of nuclei in pulsar magnetospheres and supernova remnants, predict\nthat heavy nuclei accelerated directly by gamma-ray pulsars could contribute\nabout 20% of the observed cosmic rays in the knee region. Such a contribution\nof heavy nuclei to the cosmic ray spectrum at the knee can significantly\nincrease the average value of $<\\ln A>$ with increasing energy as is suggested\nby recent observations.",

    "summary": "The outburst cycles of black hole X-ray transients are now generally\nunderstood as caused by a thermal instability in the accretion disk, the same\nmechanism as in dwarf novae outbursts. During quiescence the accretion occurs\nvia a cool disk in the outer region but changes to a coronal flow/ADAF in the\ninner region. The transition to the coronal flow is caused by evaporation of\nmatter from the cool disk. This process is an important feature for the disk\nevolution. We point out that if the disk is depleted during the outburst, e.g.\nby irradiation, its evolution during quiescence is independent of the detailed\noutburst luminosity decline. The mass accumulation during quiescence has to\nmeet several constraints as the accretion rate, the recurrence time and the\ntotal outburst energy. We present a critical discussion of different ways to\nmodel X-ray transient outburst cycles and compare with the requirements from\nobservations. For the case of only little mass left over after the outburst the\nobservations indicate a frictional parameter in the cool disk of order\nalpha(cold) =0.05, similar to that in dwarf nova disks during quiescence, with\nno need to resort to much lower alpha values of order 0.005.",

We find that moderate, up to 20%, changes of hadron\nmasses do not spoil the quality of the fits, which remain as good as those\nobtained without modifications. The fits with the modified masses yield,\nhowever, modified values of the optimal temperature and baryon chemical\npotential. In particular, with decreasing masses of all hadrons (except for\npseudo-Goldstone bosons) the fitted values of the temperature and the baryon\nchemical potential are lowered, with the change approximately proportional to\nthe scaling of masses. In addition, we find that the broadening of the hadron\nwidths by less than a factor of two practically does not affect the fits.",

As a consequence the following further\nproperties can be deduced using this shape-changing collision. (i) The exciting\npossibility of switching of solitons between orthogonally polarized modes of\nthe birefringent fiber exists. (ii) When additional effects due to periodic\nrotation of birefringence axes are considered, the shape changing collision can\nbe used as a switch to suppress or to enhance the periodic intensity exchange\nbetween the orthogonally polarized modes. (iii) For ultra short optical soliton\npulse propagation in non-Kerr media, from the governing equation an integrable\nsystem of coupled nonlinear Schroedinger equation with cubic-quintic terms is\nidentified. It admits a nonlocal Poisson bracket structure. (iv) If we take the\nhigher-order terms in the coupled nonlinear Schroedinger equation into account\nthen their effect on the shape-changing collision of solitons, during optical\npulse propagation, can be studied by using a direct perturbational approach.",

The\ncritical strain level $\\epsilon_{crit}$ criterion (phenomenological criterion)\nof Chisholm and Pennycook is applied to the computer simulation data to\nestimate the thickness of the nonsuperconducting layer ${\\rm h_n}$ enveloping\nthe grain boundaries. The ${\\rm h_n}$ is estimated also by a bond-valence-sum\nanalysis. We propose that the phenomenological criterion is caused by the\nchange of the bond lengths and valence of atoms in the GB structure on the\natomic level. The macro- and micro- approaches become consistent if the\n$\\epsilon_{crit}$ is greater than in earlier papers. It is predicted that the\nsymmetrical tilt GB $\\Sigma5$ $\\theta = \\q{53.13}{^{\\circ}}$ should demonstrate\na largest critical current across the boundary.",

The\nresulting excitation function for the number of $J/\\Psi$'s over open charm\npairs exhibits nontrivial structure around $\\sqrt{s} \\simeq 30$ AGeV, evolving\ninto a significant rise towards maximal RHIC energy.

Moreover, in the\nelectronic domain, the causality principle does not forbid negative group\ndelays of analytic signals in electronic circuits, in which the peak of an\noutput pulse leaves the exit port of a circuit before the peak of the input\npulse enters the input port. Furthermore, pulse distortion for these\nsuperluminal analytic signals can be negligible in both the optical and\nelectronic domains. Here we suggest an extension of these ideas to the\nmicroelectronic domain. The underlying principle is that negative feedback can\nbe used to produce negative group delays. Such negative group delays can be\nused to cancel out the positive group delays due to transistor latency (e.g.,\nthe finite RC rise time of MOSFETS caused by their intrinsic gate capacitance),\nas well as the propagation delays due to the interconnects between transistors.\nUsing this principle, it is possible to speed up computer systems.",

    "summary": "A complete 5-dimensional SU(5) unified theory is constructed which, on\ncompactification on the orbifold with two different Z_2's (Z_2 and Z_2'),\nyields the minimal supersymmetric standard model. The orbifold accomplishes\nSU(5) gauge symmetry breaking, doublet-triplet splitting, and a vanishing of\nproton decay from operators of dimension 5. Until 4d supersymmetry is broken,\nall proton decay from dimension 4 and dimension 5 operators is forced to vanish\nby an exact U(1)_R symmetry. Quarks and leptons and their Yukawa interactions\nare located at the Z_2 orbifold fixed points, where SU(5) is unbroken. A new\nmechanism for introducing SU(5) breaking into the quark and lepton masses is\nintroduced, which originates from the SU(5) violation in the zero-mode\nstructure of bulk multiplets. Even though SU(5) is absent at the Z_2' orbifold\nfixed point, the brane threshold corrections to gauge coupling unification are\nargued to be negligibly small, while the logarithmic corrections are small and\nin a direction which improves the agreement with the experimental measurements\nof the gauge couplings. Furthermore, the X gauge boson mass is lowered, so that\nproton decay to e^+ \\pi^0 is expected with a rate within about one order of\nmagnitude of the current limit. Supersymmetry breaking occurs on the Z_2'\norbifold fixed point, and is felt directly by the gauge and Higgs sectors,\nwhile squarks and sleptons acquire mass via gaugino mediation, solving the\nsupersymmetric flavor problem.",

The physical origin of the temperature\nplateau is outlined. Predictions are then compared with T~Tauri star\nobservations, with emphasis on the necessity of suitable beam convolution. Jet\nwidths and variations in line profiles with distance and line tracer are well\nreproduced.

Most of its discernible consequences\nfollow from its effect on evolution of the expansion rate of the Universe,\nwhich in turn affects the growth of density perturbations and the age of the\nUniverse, and can be probed by the classical kinematic cosmological tests.\nAbsent a compelling theoretical model (or even a class of models), we describe\ndark energy by an effective equation of state w=p_X/rho_X which is allowed to\nvary with time. We describe and compare different approaches for determining\nw(t), including magnitude-redshift (Hubble) diagram, number counts of galaxies\nand clusters, and CMB anisotropy, focusing particular attention on the use of a\nsample of several thousand type Ia supernova with redshifts z < 1.7, as might\nbe gathered by the proposed SNAP satellite.

Analogous to the\nCircumstellar Habitable Zone (CHZ), the GHZ is that region in the Milky Way\nwhere an Earth-like planet can retain liquid water on its surface and provide a\nlong-term habitat for animal-like aerobic life. In this paper we examine the\ndependence of the GHZ on Galactic chemical evolution. The single most important\nfactor is likely the dependence of terrestrial planet mass on the metallicity\nof its birth cloud. We estimate, very approximately, that a metallicity at\nleast half that of the Sun is required to build a habitable terrestrial planet.\nThe mass of a terrestrial planet has important consequences for interior heat\nloss, volatile inventory, and loss of atmosphere. A key issue is the production\nof planets that sustain plate tectonics, a critical recycling process that\nprovides feedback to stabilize atmospheric temperatures on planets with oceans\nand atmospheres. Due to the more recent decline from the early intense star\nformation activity in the Milky Way, the concentration in the interstellar\nmedium of the geophysically important radioisotopes, $^{40}$K, $^{235, 238}$U,\n$^{232}$Th, has been declining relative to Fe, an abundant element in the\nEarth. Also likely important are the relative abundances of Si and Mg to Fe,\nwhich affects the mass of the core relative to the mantle in a terrestrial\nplanet. All these elements and isotopes vary with time and location in the\nMilky Way; thus, planetary systems forming in other locations and times in the\nMilky Way with the same metallicity as the Sun will not necessarily form\nhabitable Earth-like planets.",

The broad-band power density spectrum of the source shows significant high\nfrequency noise component with a cut-off at 60-80 Hz. ii) Type II states: The\nhard spectral component has a break in its slope at ~12-20 keV. The high\nfrequency part of the power density spectrum fades quickly lacking significant\nvariability at frequencies higher than ~30 Hz. These two types of the X-ray\nhard states are also clearly distinguished by their properties in the radio\nband: while during the type I observations the source tends to be\n'radio-quiet', the type II observations are characterized by high level of\nradio flux ('plateau' radio states). In this work we demonstrate aforementioned\ndifferences using the data of 12 representative hard steady state observations.\nWe conclude that the difference between these two types can be probably\nexplained in terms of different structure of the accretion flow in the\nimmediate vicinity of the compact object due to presence of relativistic\noutflow of matter.",

We use a Hamiltonian\nformulation and light-front quantization because this may produce a convergent\nFock-space expansion. The QCD Hamiltonian is systematically renormalized to\nsecond order in the strong coupling and the Fock-space expansion is truncated\nto lowest order to produce a finite-dimensional Hamiltonian matrix. The\nrenormalized Hamiltonian is used to calculate the spectra of the $b\\bar{b}$ and\n$c\\bar{c}$ mesons as a lowest-order test of our procedure for full QCD.\n  The analytic determination of the renormalized Hamiltonian matrix generates\nexpressions that must be numerically integrated to generate quantitative\nresults. The efficiency of the numerical calculation depends on how well the\nbasis functions can approximate the real state. We examine the effectiveness of\nusing Basis-Splines (B-Splines) to represent QCD states. After briefly\ndescribing these functions, we test them using the one- and two-dimensional\nharmonic oscillator problems. We test their ability to represent realistic\nwavefunctions by using them to find the glueball mass spectrum.\n  An efficient algorithm for numerically calculating the matrix elements in the\nglueball and meson problems is necessary because the calculation is numerically\nintensive.

After a sudden quench into the\nordered phase with a final temperature above the ordering spinodal, T_f > T_sp,\nthe early time kinetics is dominated by a segregation front which propagates\ninto the bulk with nearly constant velocity. Below the spinodal, T_f < T_sp,\nmotion of the segregation wave reflects a coarsening process which appears to\nbe slower than predicted by the Lifschitz-Allen-Cahn law. In addition, in the\nfront-penetrated region lateral growth differs distinctly from perpendicular\ngrowth, as a result of the special structure of antiphase boundaries near the\nsurface. Our results are compared with recent experiments on the subsurface\nordering kinetics at Cu_3Au (001).",

In Chapter 3, the\nrenormalization of quantum theory of matter fields and related topics, like\nrenormalization group, effective potential and anomalies, are considered.\nChapter 4 is devoted to the action of particles in a space-time with torsion,\nand to possible physical effects generated by the background torsion. In\nparticular, we review the upper bounds for the background torsion which are\nknown from the literature. In Chapter 5, the comprehensive study of the\npossibility of a theory for the propagating completely antisymmetric torsion\nfield is presented. We show, that the propagating torsion may be consistent\nwith the principles of quantum theory only in the case when the torsion mass is\nmuch greater than the mass of the heaviest fermion coupled to torsion. Then,\nuniversality of the fermion-torsion interaction implies that torsion itself has\na huge mass, and can not be observed in realistic experiments. In Chapter 6, we\nbriefly discuss the string-induced torsion and the possibility to induce\ntorsion action and torsion itself through the quantum effects of matter fields.",

From the\nstandard deviations of the various regressions, an upper limit can be obtained\non the overall inhomogeneity of the reddening in the individual clusters.

Recently, a study of the generalization of the BKL chaotic behaviour\nto the superstring effective Lagrangians has revealed that this chaos is rooted\nin the structure of the fundamental Weyl chamber of some underlying hyperbolic\nKac-Moody algebra. In this letter, we show that the same connection applies to\npure gravity in any spacetime dimension $\\geq 4$, where the relevant algebras\nare $AE_d$.

In recent\nyears, techniques to detect these oscillations as a function of the meson's\ndecay time have been developed. In this article the physics of flavor\noscillations is reviewed and theoretical predictions are summarized. The many\nobservations that demonstrate the time-dependence of $B^0-\\B0bar$ oscillations\nare presented along with a combined measurement of its frequency, $\\delta m_d$.\nThe attempts to measure the $B_s$ oscillation frequency, both directly and\nindirectly, are then summarized. Finally, values for the CKM elements\n$|V_{td}|$ and $|V_{ts}/V_{td}|$ are extracted.",

    "summary": "Of all high-energy particles, only neutrinos can directly convey astronomical\ninformation from the edge of the universe---and from deep inside the most\ncataclysmic high-energy processes. Copiously produced in high-energy\ncollisions, travelling at the velocity of light, and not deflected by magnetic\nfields, neutrinos meet the basic requirements for astronomy. Their unique\nadvantage arises from a fundamental property: they are affected only by the\nweakest of nature's forces (but for gravity) and are therefore essentially\nunabsorbed as they travel cosmological distances between their origin and us.\nMany of the outstanding mysteries of astrophysics may be hidden from our sight\nat all wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum because of absorption by\nmatter and radiation between us and the source. For example, the hot dense\nregions that form the central engines of stars and galaxies are opaque to\nphotons. In other cases, such as supernova remnants, gamma ray bursters, and\nactive galaxies, all of which may involve compact objects or black holes at\ntheir cores, the precise origin of the high-energy photons emerging from their\nsurface regions is uncertain. Therefore, data obtained through a variety of\nobservational windows---and especially through direct observations with\nneutrinos---may be of cardinal importance. In this talk, the scientific goals\nof high energy neutrino astronomy and the technical aspects of water and ice\nCherenkov detectors are examined, and future experimental possibilities,\nincluding a kilometer-square deep ice neutrino telescope, are explored.",

SN 1999em is the\nfirst Type II-P detected at both X-ray and radio wavelengths. The Chandra X-ray\ndata indicate non-radiative interaction of SN ejecta with a power-law density\nprofile (rho \\propto r^{-n} with n ~ 7) with a pre-SN wind with a low mass-loss\nrate of ~2 \\times 10^{-6} M_sun/yr for a wind velocity of 10 km/sec, in\nagreement with radio mass-loss rate estimates. The Chandra data show an\nunexpected, temporary rise in the 0.4--2.0 keV X-ray flux at ~100 days after\nexplosion. SN 1998S, at an age of >3 years, is still bright in X-rays and is\nincreasing in flux density at cm radio wavelengths. Spectral fits to the\nChandra data show that many heavy elements (Ne, Al, Si, S, Ar, and Fe) are\noverabundant with respect to solar values. We compare the observed elemental\nabundances and abundance ratios to theoretical calculations and find that our\ndata are consistent with a progenitor mass of approximately 15-20 M_sun if the\nheavy element ejecta are radially mixed out to a high velocity. If the X-ray\nemission is from the reverse shock wave region, the supernova density profile\nmust be moderately flat at a velocity ~10^4 km/sec, the shock front is\nnon-radiative at the time of the observations, and the mass-loss rate is 1-2\n\\times 10^{-4} M_sun/yr for a pre-supernova wind velocity of 10 km/sec. This\nresult is also supported by modeling of the radio emission which implies that\nSN 1998S is surrounded by a clumpy or filamentary CSM established by a high\nmass-loss rate, ~2 \\times 10^{-4} M_sun/yr, from the pre-supernova star.",

Even a very\nsmall initial binary fraction (e.g., 10%) can play a key role in supporting a\ncluster against gravothermal collapse for many relaxation times. Inelastic\nencounters between binaries and single stars or other binaries provide a very\nsignificant energy source for the cluster. These dynamical interactions also\nlead to the production of large numbers of exotic systems such as ultracompact\nX-ray binaries, recycled radio pulsars, double degenerate systems, and blue\nstragglers. Our work is based on a new parallel supercomputer code implementing\nHenon's Monte Carlo method for simulating the dynamical evolution of dense\nstellar systems in the Fokker-Planck approximation. This new code allows us to\ncalculate very accurately the evolution of a cluster containing a realistic\nnumber of stars (N ~ 10^5 - 10^6) in typically a few hours to a few days of\ncomputing time. The discrete, star-by-star representation of the cluster in the\nsimulation makes it possible to treat naturally a number of important\nprocesses, including single and binary star evolution, all dynamical\ninteractions of single stars and binaries, and tidal interactions with the\nGalaxy.",

A\nvery high stellar mass can be ruled out as the cause of the fast evolution.\nInstead the evolution time scale is reproduced in stellar models by making the\nassumption that the efficiency for element mixing in the He-flash convection\nzone during the very late thermal pulse is smaller than predicted by the\nmixing-length theory. As a result the main energy generation from fast proton\ncapture occurs closer to the surface and the expansion to the giant state is\naccelerated to a few years. Assuming a mass of V4334 Sgr of 0.604Msun -- which\nis consistent with a distance of 4kpc -- a reduction of the mixing length\ntheory mixing efficiency by a factor of ~ 100 is required to match its\nevolutionary time scale.

A new\nnucleosynthesis mode of hot hydrogen-deficient He3 burning can explain the\nextraordinary lithium abundance. During the thermal pulse He3 is ingested from\nthe envelope together with the protons into the hot He-flash convection zone.\nThe first network calculations show that due to the large C12 abundance protons\nare rather captured by carbon than destroy newly formed Be7 and ultimately Li7.\nMoreover, the short evolution time scale has been reproduced by making the\nassumption that the convective efficiency for element mixing is smaller by two\nto three orders of magnitude than predicted by the mixing-length theory. As a\nresult the main energy generation from fast convective proton capture will\noccur at a larger mass coordinate, closer to the surface and the expansion to\nthe giant state is accelerated to a few years in agreement with Sakurai's\nbehavior.

The phase degrees\nof freedom of the mean field for hoppings of holons and spinons can be regarded\nas a U(1) gauge field, $A_i$. The charge-spin separation occurs below certain\ntemperature, $T_{\\rm CSS}$, as a deconfinement phenomenon of the dynamics of\n$A_i$. Below certain temperature $T_{\\rm SG} (< T_{\\rm CSS})$, the spin-gap\nphase develops as the Higgs phase of the gauge-field dynamics, and $A_i$\nacquires a mass $m_A$. The effective field theory near $T_{\\rm SG}$ takes the\nform of Ginzburg-Landau theory of a complex scalar field $\\lambda$ coupled with\n$A_i$, where $\\lambda$ represents d-wave pairings of spinons. Three\ndimensionality of the system is crucial to realize a phase transition at\n$T_{\\rm SG}$.\n  By using this field theory, we calculate the dc resistivity $\\rho$.

We propose that\nthe ``Bragg glass'' phase generically transforms via two separate thermodynamic\nphase transitions into a disordered liquid on increasing the temperature. The\nfirst transition is into a glassy phase, topologically disordered at the\nlargest length scales; current evidence suggests that it lacks the long-ranged\nphase correlations expected of a ``vortex glass''. This phase has a significant\ndegree of short-ranged translational order, unlike the disordered liquid, but\nno quasi-long range order, in contrast to the Bragg glass. This glassy phase,\nwhich we call a ``multi-domain glass'', is confined to a narrow sliver at\nintermediate fields, but broadens out both for much larger and much smaller\nfield values. The multi-domain glass may be a ``hexatic glass''; alternatively,\nits glassy properties may originate in the replica symmetry breaking envisaged\nin recent theories of the structural glass transition. Estimates for\ntranslational correlation lengths in the multi-domain glass indicate that they\ncan be far larger than the interline spacing for weak disorder, suggesting a\nplausible mechanism by which signals of a two-step transition can be obscured.\nCalculations of the Bragg glass-multi-domain glass and the multi-domain\nglass-disordered liquid phase boundaries are presented and compared to\nexperimental data. We argue that these proposals provide a unified picture of\nthe available experimental data on both high-T$_c$ and low-T$_c$ materials,\nsimulations and current theoretical understanding.",

In this case in fact the emission via inverse Compton\nscattering off cosmic background photons is enhanced and the resulting\npredicted X-ray spectrum well accounts for the otherwise puzzling observations.\nHere we point out another reason to favor relativistic large scale jets, based\non a minimum power argument: by estimating the Poynting flux and bulk kinetic\npowers corresponding to, at least, the relativistic particles and magnetic\nfield responsible for the emission, one can derive the value of the bulk\nLorentz factor for which the total power is minimized. It is found that both\nthe inner and extended parts of the jet of PKS 0637-752 satisfy such condition.",

Convectively enhanced energy transport inside the\nneutron star can have important consequences for the neutrino emission and thus\nthe neutrino-heating mechanism.

Multi-dimensional hydrodynamics,\ngeneral relativity, and a better understanding of the neutrino interactions in\nneutron star matter may be crucial to resolve the problem that state-of-the-art\nspherical models do not yield explosions even with a very accurate treatment of\nneutrino transport by solving the Boltzmann equation.",

In order to estimate\nthe role of each currency making the EUR and therefore in view of identifying\nwhether some of them mostly influences its behavior, we have compared the\ntime-dependent exponent of the exchange rate fluctuations for EUR with that for\nthe currencies that form the EUR.

We have found that the anomaly inversely\ncorrelates with the binary components separation. There is evidence that the\ncorrelation reflects actual population differences between close and wide\nbinary pairs, in which case it indicates that the anomaly is somehow associated\nwith the interaction of binary's components. The anomaly has also been found to\ncorrelate with both kinematics and metallicity. The sense of the correlations\nimplies that the anomaly increases as the star evolves, suggesting a peculiar\nevolution of a primary F star in a tight binary pair. This conclusion has\nfurther been supported by the study of the age-velocity relation (AVR) of F\nstars that are cataloged in the HIPPARCOS as single. Among these stars, those\nwith brightness anomaly were previously shown to be most likely unidentified\nclose binaries. We have found that the AVR of these binary candidates is\ndifferent from that of the ``truly single'' F stars. The discrepancy between\nthe two AVRs indicates that the putative binaries are, on average, older than\nsimilar normal single F stars at the same effective temperature and luminosity,\nwhich is consistent with the inferred peculiar evolution in close binaries. It\nappears that this peculiarity is caused by the impact of the components\ninteraction in a tight pair on stellar evolution, which results in the\nprolonged main sequence lifetime of the primary F star.",

    "summary": "A theory of a confined two dimensional electrolyte is presented. The positive\nand negative ions, interacting by a $1/r$ potential, are constrained to move on\nan interface separating two solvents with dielectric constants $\\epsilon_1$ and\n$\\epsilon_2$. It is shown that the Debye-H\\\"uckel type of theory predicts that\nthe this 2d Coulomb fluid should undergo a phase separation into a coexisting\nliquid (high density) and gas (low density) phases. We argue, however, that the\nformation of polymer-like chains of alternating positive and negative ions can\nprevent this phase transition from taking place.",

    "summary": "We present a joint analysis of the power spectra of density fluctuations from\nthree independent cosmological redshift surveys; the PSCz galaxy catalog, the\nAPM galaxy cluster catalog and the Abell/ACO cluster catalog. Over the range\n0.03 <= k <= 0.15 h/Mpc,the amplitudes of these three power spectra are related\nthrough a simple linear biasing model with b = 1.5 and b = 3.6 for Abell/ACO\nversus APM and Abell/ACO versus the PSCz respectively. Furthermore, the shape\nof these power spectra are remarkably similar despite the fact that they are\ncomprised of significantly different objects (individual galaxies through to\nrich clusters). Individually, each of these surveys show visible evidence for\n``valleys'' in their power spectra. We use a newly developed statistical\ntechnique called the False Discovery Rate, to show that these ``valleys'' are\nstatistically significant. One favored cosmological explanation for such\nfeatures in the power spectrum is the presence of a non-negligible baryon\nfraction (Omega_b/Omega_m) in the Universe which causes acoustic oscillations\nin the transfer function of adiabatic inflationary models. We have performed a\nmaximum-likelihood marginalization over four important cosmological parameters\nof this model (Omega_m, Omega_b, n_s, H_o). We use a prior on H_0 = 69(+/-15),\nand find Omega_mh^2 = 0.12(+0.03/-0.02), Omega_bh^2 =0.029(+0.011/-0.015), n_s\n= 1.08^(+0.17/-0.20) (2 sigma confidence limits) which are fully consistent\nwith the favored values of these cosmological parameters from the recent Cosmic\nMicrowave Background (CMB) experiments. This agreement strongly suggests that\nwe have detected baryonic oscillations in the power spectrum of matter at a\nlevel expected from a Cold Dark Matter model normalized to fit these CMB\nmeasurements.",

    "summary": "We conjecture that brown dwarfs are substellar objects because they have been\nejected from small newborn multiple systems which have decayed in dynamical\ninteractions. In this view, brown dwarfs are stellar embryos for which the star\nformation process was aborted before the hydrostatic cores could build up\nenough mass to eventually start hydrogen burning. The disintegration of a small\nmultiple system is a stochastic process, which can be described only in terms\nof the half-life of the decay. A stellar embryo competes with its siblings in\norder to accrete infalling matter, and the one that grows slowest is most\nlikely to be ejected. With better luck, a brown dwarf would therefore have\nbecome a normal star. This interpretation of brown dwarfs readily explains the\nrarity of brown dwarfs as companions to normal stars (aka the ``brown dwarf\ndesert''), the absence of wide brown dwarf binaries, and the flattening of the\nlow mass end of the initial mass function. Possible observational tests of this\nscenario include statistics of brown dwarfs near Class 0 sources, and the\nkinematics of brown dwarfs in star forming regions while they still retain a\nkinematic signature of their expulsion. Because the ejection process limits the\namount of gas brought along in a disk, it is predicted that substellar\nequivalents to the classical T Tauri stars should be very rare.",

The model is\ncapable of reproducing crucial features of Gamma ray bursts, such as the\nepisodic activity of the engine (multiple and random shell emission) and the\ntwo distinct categories of the bursts (two regimes are isolated in the model\nwith \\sim 2 s and \\sim 81 s burst total duration).",

We demonstrate that at high bias the thermionic current\nover the Schottky barrier, the height of which is reduced due to an interfacial\nlayer between the contact and CZT material, controls the leakage current of the\ndetectors.

HI appears in the region when the leftover H2 is illuminated with UV\nphotons from nearby young stars. The physics of photodissociation regions\nprovides a natural and quantitative explanation for the appearance of HI\nenvelopes around the clouds, and for CO(1-0) emission from the higher-density\nparts of their surfaces.

Our\nmethod combines the properties of integrable scattering together with a\nLandauer-Buttiker formalism. Although we use integrability, the nature of the\nproblem is such that our results are not generically exact, but must only be\nconsidered as excellent approximations which nonetheless are valid all the way\nthrough crossover regimes.\n  The key to our approach is to identify the excitations that correspond to\nscattering states and then to compute their associated scattering amplitudes.\nWe are able to do so both in and out of equilibrium. In equilibrium and at zero\ntemperature, we reproduce the Friedel sum rule for an arbitrary magnetic field.\nAt finite temperature, we study the linear response conductance at the\nsymmetric point of the Anderson model, and reproduce Costi et al.'s numerical\nrenormalization group computation of this quantity. We then explore the\nout-of-equilibrium conductance for a near-symmetric Anderson model, and arrive\nat quantitative expressions for the differential conductance, both in and out\nof a magnetic field. We find the expected splitting of the differential\nconductance peak into two in a finite magnetic field, $H$. We determine the\nwidth, height, and position of these peaks. In particular we find for H >> T_k,\nthe Kondo temperature, the differential conductance has maxima of e^2/h\noccuring for a bias V close to but smaller than H. The nature of our\nconstruction of scattering states suggests that our results for the\ndifferential magneto-conductance are not merely approximate but become exact in\nthe large field limit.",

This treatment closely\nparallels the corresponding development in lossless compression, a point of\nview that was advanced in an important paper of Wyner and Ziv in 1989. In the\nlossless case we review how the AEP underlies the analysis of the Lempel-Ziv\nalgorithm by viewing it as a random code and reducing it to the idealized\nShannon code. This also provides information about the redundancy of the\nLempel-Ziv algorithm and about the asymptotic behavior of several relevant\nquantities. In the lossy case we give various versions of the statement of the\ngeneralized AEP and we outline the general methodology of its proof via large\ndeviations. Its relationship with Barron's generalized AEP is also discussed.\nThe lossy AEP is applied to: (i) prove strengthened versions of Shannon's\nsource coding theorem and universal coding theorems; (ii) characterize the\nperformance of mismatched codebooks; (iii) analyze the performance of pattern-\nmatching algorithms for lossy compression; (iv) determine the first order\nasymptotics of waiting times (with distortion) between stationary processes;\n(v) characterize the best achievable rate of weighted codebooks as an optimal\nsphere-covering exponent. We then present a refinement to the lossy AEP and use\nit to: (i) prove second order coding theorems; (ii) characterize which sources\nare easier to compress; (iii) determine the second order asymptotics of waiting\ntimes; (iv) determine the precise asymptotic behavior of longest match-lengths.\nExtensions to random fields are also given.",

The effect of these\nprocesses depends on the orbital separation, hence on the orbital phase of the\neccentric orbit. The variation of the mass outflow from the binary system with\nthe orbital phase leads to a large-scale departure from axisymmetry along the\nequatorial plane, as is observed in Eta Car. I further speculated that such a\ncompanion may have accreted a large fraction of the mass that was expelled in\nthe Great Eruption of 1850 and the Lesser Eruption of 1890. The accretion\nprocess was likely to form an accretion disk, with the formation of a CFW, or\njets, on the two sides of the accretion disk.

    "summary": "We study the dependence of macroscopic polarization on composition and strain\nin wurtzite III-V nitride ternary alloys using ab initio density-functional\ntechniques. The spontaneous polarization is characterized by a large bowing,\nstrongly dependent on the alloy microscopic structure. The bowing is due to the\ndifferent response of the bulk binaries to hydrostatic pressure, and to\ninternal strain effects (bond alternation). Disorder effects are instead minor.\nDeviations from parabolicity (simple bowing) are of order 10 % in the most\nextreme case of AlInN alloy, much less at all other compositions. Piezoelectric\npolarization is also strongly non-linear. At variance with the spontaneous\ncomponent, this behavior is independent of microscopic alloy structure or\ndisorder effects, and due entirely to the non-linear strain dependence of the\nbulk piezoelectric response. It is thus possible to predict the piezoelectric\npolarization for any alloy composition using the piezoelectricity of the parent\nbinaries.",

In this case, an angular momentum of a Cooper pair plays an important\nrole in the Kondo effect. It produces multichannel exchange couplings with a\nlocal spin. Here we focus on a $p_x +i p_y$-wave state which is a full gap\nsystem. The calculated impurity susceptibility shows that the local spin is\nalmost quenched by the Kondo effect in the strong coupling region ($T_{\\rm\nK}/\\Delta \\to \\infty$), while the ground state is always a spin doublet over\nall the $T_{\\rm K}/\\Delta$ region. Here $T_{\\rm K}$ and $\\Delta$ are the Kondo\ntemperature and the superconducting energy gap, respectively. This is different\nfrom the s-wave pairing case where the Kondo singlet is realized for large\n$T_{\\rm K}/\\Delta$ values. The strong coupling analysis shows that the $p_x +i\np_y$-wave Cooper pair is connected to the Kondo singlet via the orbital\ndynamics of the paired electrons, generating the spin of the ground state.

It is remarkable that the blue wings\nin the submillimeter lines are stronger by a factor of 3-4 than that of the CO\nJ=1-0 emission line. The CO line ratios suggest that the blueshifted lobe of\nthis outflow consists of moderately dense gas of n(H_2) = (1-3)x10^4 cm^-3\nheated to T_kin = 50-170 K.It is also suggested that the kinetic temperature of\nthe outflowing gas increases from ~80 K near the protostar to ~170 K at the\nshocked region in the lobe center, toward which the largest velocity dispersion\nof the CO emission is observed. A remarkable correlation between the kinetic\ntemperature and velocity dispersion of the CO emission along the lobe provides\nus with direct evidence that the molecular gas at the head of the jet-driven\nbow shock is indeed heated kinematically.

Two\ncompeting effects determine the common collective soundwave-like mode with\nsound velocity $v$, arising from gauge symmetry breaking: i) The sound velocity\n$v_0$ (corresponding to a weakly interacting Bose system on a rigid lattice) in\nthe lowest order approximation is reduced due to reduction of the repulsive\nboson-boson interaction, arising from the attractive part of phonon mediated\ninteraction in the static limit. ii) the second order correction to the sound\nvelocity is enhanced as compared to the one of bosons on a rigid lattice when\nthe the boson-phonon interaction is switched on due to the retarded nature of\nphonon mediated interaction. The overall effect is that the sound velocity is\npractically unaffected by the coupling with phonons, indicating the robustness\nof the superfluid state.

The Ursa Major Cluster\nis therefore a good place to study the statistical properties of dwarf galaxies\nsince this structure is at an evolutionary stage representative of typical\nenvironments yet has enough galaxies that reasonable counting statistics can be\naccumulated. The main observational results of our survey are: (i) The galaxy\nluminosity function is flat, with a logarithmic slope alpha = -1.1 for -17 <\nM_R < -11, from a power-law fit. The error in alpha is likely to be less than\n0.2 and is dominated by systematic errors, primarily associatedd with\nuncertainties in assigning membership to specific galaxies. This faint end\nslope is quite different to what was seen in the Virgo Cluster where\nalpha=-2.26. (ii) Dwarf galaxies are as frequently found to be blue dwarf\nirregulars as red dwarf spheroidals in the blind cluster fields. The density of\nred dwarfs is significantly higher in the fields around luminous members than\nin the blind fields. The most important result is the failure to detect many\ndwarfs.

    "summary": "We continue to study out of equilibrium TFT with switching on the interaction\noccurring at finite time. We exploit the concept of projected function (PF) and\nWigner transform of projected function (WTPF). WTPF's are bare propagators,\none-loop self-energies, retarded and advanced components of the resummed\npropagator. Among WTPF's convolution product is very simple, one does not need\ngradient expansion. However, WTPF's are completely determined by their infinite\ntime limit and, thus, cannot be the carriers of relaxation phenomena.\nFurthermore, we observe that the functions capable of carrying relaxation\nphenomena (non-WTPF) emerge in the mixed (\"ill-defined\") products of retarded\nand advanced propagators and self-energies. In particular, only non-WTPF's\ncontribute to time variation of equal-time Green functions (particle number,\netc.); contributions from WTPF will be constant in time. As these are generated\nin mixed products, the pinching phenomenon is being promoted from an obstacle\nto the central feature of out of equilibrium TFT. We analyze the pinching\nphenomenon. In the case of naive pinching we reproduce known results. In\nSchwinger-Dyson equations the Keldysh component of self-energy is well defined\neven for multiple self-energy insertion contributions. We calaculate explicitly\nsingle self-energy contribution to Keldysh component of propagator which\ngenerates nontrivial time dependence. For photon production from QCD plasma\n(finite-lifetime effect) our approximate analytic results agree with the\nresults by S. -Y. Wang and D. Boyanovsky obtained within dynamical\nrenormalisation group approach.",

The model is characterized by the Cu-O site energy splitting, the\nCu-O first neighbor hopping and the O-O second neighbor hopping. For the\nsufficiently large O-O hoppings, two bands can come together at one point on\nthe diagonal of the square Brillouin zone, but they cannot cross. The range of\nthe parameters for which the band touching occurs is determined. The model\nrelates the band touching at the bottom of the two bands to the appearance of\nthe extended, one-dimensional-like van Hove singularity at the lower edge of\nthe density of states. With 1+\\delta holes (\\delta small) the extended van Hove\nsingularity can thus occur close to the Fermi level only if the latter cuts two\nbands.The topology of the Fermi surfaces observed by ARPES in the high-Tc\nsuperconductors elliminates such possibility. The Fermi surfaces in LSCO,\nBi1221 and Y123 are than fitted with the one of the three bands at the Fermi\nlevel. The agreement is excellent considering in particular the fact that the\nfits use only two parameters. The departure of the measured band structure from\nthe three band prediction, found on the small energy scales away from the Fermi\nlevel, is attributed to the effects of the fluctuations not included into the\nenergy scales which define the three band structure.",

The model shows three phases. The first is characterised by phase\nseparation of an exceptionally robust sort, termed Strong Phase Separation,\nwhich survives at all temperature. The second phase has trivial static\ncorrelations, but density fluctuations are transported by a pair of kinematic\nwaves involving both species. In the most interesting case, the two linearised\neigenmodes, although nonlinearly coupled, have different dynamic exponents. The\nthird ``phase'' arises at the phase boundary between the first two. Here, the\nfirst species evolves autonomously, but its fluctuations influence the\nevolution of the second, as in the passive scalar problem.

Five color SDSS\nphotometry is used to make accurate photometric redshift estimates that are\nused to rescale and combine the lensing measurements. The mean shear from these\nclusters is detected to 2 h-1 Mpc at the 7-sigma level, corresponding to a mass\nwithin that radius of 4.2 +/- 0.6 x 10^14 h-1 M_sun. The shear profile is well\nfit by a power law with index -0.9 +/- 0.3, consistent with that of an\nisothermal density profile.

The optical mass function is f(M)=2.74 +/- 0.12 solar masses. We\nfind a photometric period of P_photo=2.81730 +/- 0.00001 days using a light\ncurve measured from photographic plates. The folded light curve resembles an\nellipsoidal light curve with two maxima of roughly equal height and two minima\nof unequal depth per orbital cycle. The secondary star is a late B-type star\nwhich has evolved off the main sequence. Using a moderate resolution spectrum\n(R=7000) we measure T_eff=10500 +/- 200K, log(g)=3.5 +/- 0.1, and\nV_rot*sin(i)=123 +/- 4 km/sec (1 sigma errors). Assuming synchronous rotation,\nour measured value of the projected rotational velocity implies a mass ratio of\nQ=M_1/M_2=1.50 +/- 0.08 (1sigma). The lack of X-ray eclipses implies an upper\nlimit to the inclination of i<70.7 deg. On the other hand, the large amplitude\nof the folded light curve (about 0.5 mag) implies a large inclination (i>60\ndeg). Using the above mass function, mass ratio, and inclination range, the\nmass of the compact object is in the range 8.73 < M_1 < 11.70 solar masses and\nthe mass of the secondary star is in the range 5.49 < M_2 < 8.14 solar masses\n(90% confidence). The mass of the compact object is well above the maximum mass\nof a stable neutron star and we conclude that V4641 Sgr contains a black hole.",

This relation splits the vertex into two parts:\nlongitudinal (Gamma_L) and transverse (Gamma_T). Gamma_L is fixed by the WTI.\nThe description of the longitudinal part consumes 8 of the basis vectors. The\nremaining piece Gamma_T is then written in terms of 24 spin amplitudes.\nExtending the work of Ball and Chiu and Kizilersu et. al., we propose a set of\nbasis vectors T^mu_i(P_1,P_2) at finite temperature such that each of these is\ntransverse to the photon four-momentum and also satisfies T^mu_i(P,P)=0, in\naccordance with the Ward Identity, with their corresponding coefficients being\nfree of kinematic singularities.

At the leading order this self force is a (post)$^2$-Newtonian\neffect. For scalar charges with high charge-to-mass ratio, the acceleration due\nto the self force starts dominating over the regular acceleration already far\nfrom the black hole.

    "summary": "For a class of scalar partial differential equations that incorporate\nconvection, diffusion, and possibly dispersion in one space and one time\ndimension, the stability of traveling wave solutions is investigated. If the\ninitial perturbation of the traveling wave profile decays at an algebraic rate,\nthen the solution is shown to converge to a shifted wave profile at a\ncorresponding temporal algebraic rate, and optimal intermediate results that\ncombine temporal and spatial decay are obtained. The proofs are based on a\ngeneral interpolation principle which says that algebraic decay results of this\nform always follow if exponential temporal decay holds for perturbation with\nexponential spatial decay and the wave profile is stable for general\nperturbations.",

    "summary": "Warm Dark Matter (WDM) models have recently been resurrected to resolve\napparent conflicts of Cold Dark Matter (DM) models with observations. Endowing\nthe DM particles with non-negligible velocities causes free-streaming, which\nsuppresses the primordial power spectrum on small scales. The choice of a\nroot-mean-square velocity dispersion v(rms) = 0.05 km/s at redshift z=0\n(corresponding to a particle mass of 1 keV if the WDM particles are fermions\ndecoupling while relativistic) helps alleviate most, but probably not all, of\nthe small-scale problems faced by CDM. An important side-effect of the particle\nvelocities is the severe decrease in the number of collapsed halos at high\nredshift. This is caused both by the loss of small-scale power, and by the\ndelay in the collapse of the smallest individual halos (with masses near the\neffective Jeans mass of the DM). The presence of early halos is required in\norder (1) to host either early quasars or galaxies that can reionize the\nuniverse by redshift z=5.8, and (2) to allow the growth of the supermassive\nblack hole believed to power the recently discovered quasar SDSS 1044-1215 at\nthis redshift. We quantify these constraints using a modified Press-Schechter\nformalism, and find v(rms) < 0.04 km/s (or m_X > 1 keV). If future observations\nuncover massive black holes at z > 10, or reveal that reionization occurred at\nz > 10, this could conclusively rule out WDM models as the solution to the\nsmall-scale crisis of the CDM paradigm.",

The\nabsence of the disk blackbody component also underscores the requirement that\nthe seed photons for thermal Comptonization be produced locally in the hot\nflow, e.g. via synchrotron radiation.

    "summary": "Interacting galaxies like the famous Antennae (NGC 4038/4039) or Stephan's\nQuintet (HCG 92) show considerable star forming activity in their tidal arms.\nHigh resolution images (e.g. from HST-observations) indicate that these regions\nconsist of up to hundreds of massive stellar clusters or tidal dwarf galaxies\n(TDG). In this paper we want to investigate the future fate of these clusters\nof massive star clusters (in this work called super-clusters). We simulate\ncompact super-clusters in the tidal field of a host-galaxy and investigate the\ninfluence of orbital and internal parameters on the rate and timescale of the\nmerging process. We show that it is possible that such configurations merge and\nbuild a dwarf galaxy, which could be an important mechanism of how long-lived\ndwarf satellite galaxies form. A detailed study of the merger object will\nappear in a follow-up paper.",

Although the mean DWT power\nspectrum is consistent with its counterpart in Fourier representation, the\nspatial distribution of the local power varies greatly, i.e. the local DWT\npower spectra show remarkably spiky structures on small scales. To measure\nthese spiky features, we introduce the quantities, roughness, of the local\npower spectrum, and the correlation between spikes on different scales. We then\ntest the predictions made by the correlation hierarchy model on the roughness\nand the scale-scale correlations of the local power spectrum. Using the\nLy_alpha transmitted flux of the QSO HS1700, we find that the underlying cosmic\nmass field of the transmitted flux at redshift around z ~ 2.2 can be described\nby the hierarchical clustering model on physical scales from 2.5 h^{-1} Mpc to\nfew tens h^{-1} kpc in an Einstein-de Sitter universe. However, the non-linear\nfeatures of the clustering show differences on different scale ranges; 1. On\nphysical scales larger than ~ 1.3 h^{-1} Mpc, the field is almost Gaussian. 2.\nOn scales 1.3 h^{-1} Mpc - 0.3 h^{-1} Mpc, the field is consistent with the\ncorrelation hierarchy with a constant value for the coefficient Q_4. 3. On\nscales less than 300 h^{-1} kpc, the field is no longer Gaussian, but\nessentially intermittent. In this case, the field can still be fitted by the\ncorrelation hierarchy, but the coefficient, Q_4, should be scale-dependent.\nThese three points are strongly supported by the following result: the scale\ndependencies of Q_4 given by two statistically independent measures, i.e. Q_4^R\nby the roughness and Q_4^C by scale-scale correlation, are the same in the\nentire scale range considered.",

The\nmicrostructure of these materials is highly anisotropic and exhibits particular\nfeatures needed to be taken into account in order to interpret their magnetic\nand electrical properties. First the AC magnetic susceptibility c = c ' - j c\"\nhas been measured for several magnetic fields (H // ab and H // c) and compared\nto the electrical resistivity data. The structure of the c\" peak is shown to be\nrelated to the chemical content distribution of the superconducting grains.\nNext, the magnetic flux profiles have been extracted from the magnetic\nmeasurements using the Campbell - Rollins procedure. The anisotropy of the flux\nprofiles and their peculiar curvature behaviour for H // c point out the role\nof both grain platelet structure and the presence of secondary phases. From\nthese results, we conclude that the magnetic properties of such magnetically\ntextured materials do not allow for a reliable extraction of the critical\ncurrent density Jc but essentially probe geometric effects. Such effects have\nto be taken into account for improving the manufacture of attractive high-Tc\nmaterials.",

In this paper we present optical identifications for 62 of these\nsources: 28 AGN which show broad lines in their optical spectra (BLAGN), 13\nnarrow emission line galaxies (NELGs), 5 galaxies with no visible emission\nlines, 8 clusters and 8 Galactic stars. The BLAGN, NELGs and galaxies have\nsimilar distributions of X-ray flux and spectra. Their ROSAT spectra are\nconsistent with their being AGN obscured by columns of 20.5<log(NH/cm^2)<23.\nThe hard spectrum BLAGN have a distribution of X-ray to optical ratios which is\nsimilar to that found for AGN from soft X-ray surveys (1<alpha_OX<2). However,\na relatively large proportion (15%) of the BLAGN, NELGs and galaxies are radio\nloud. This could be because the radio jets in these objects produce\nintrinsically hard X-ray emission, or if their hardness is due to absorption,\nit could be because radio loud objects are more X-ray luminous than radio quiet\nobjects. The 8 hard sources identified as clusters of galaxies are the\nbrightest, and softest group of sources and hence clusters are unlikely to be\nan important component of the hard, faint population. We propose that BLAGN are\nlikely to constitute a significant fraction of the faint, hard, 0.5 - 2 keV\npopulation and could be important to reproducing the shape of the X-ray\nbackground, because they are the most numerous type of object in our sample\n(comprising almost half the identified sources), and because all our high\nredshift (z>1) identified hard sources have broad lines.",

We find that the host is a blue, slightly over-luminous galaxy with\nV_gal = 23.00 +/- 0.10, (V-R)_gal = 0.43 +/- 0.13, and a centre that is\napproximately 0.2 mag bluer than the outer regions of the galaxy.

This\ncorresponds to an exponential disk with a scale radius of 0.22 arcsec (=\n1.21/h_100 proper kpc). Subtracting a fit with elliptical isophotes leaves\nlarge residuals, which suggests that the host galaxy has a somewhat irregular\nmorphology, but we are unable to connect the location of GRB 980703 with any\nspecial features in the host. The host galaxy appears to be a typical example\nof a compact star forming galaxy similar to those found in the Hubble Deep\nField North. The R-band light curve of the optical afterglow associated with\nthis gamma-ray burst is consistent with a single power-law decay having a slope\nof alpha = -1.37 +/- 0.14. Due to the bright underlying host galaxy the late\ntime properties of the light-curve are very poorly constrained. The decay of\nthe optical light curve is consistent with a contribution from an underlying\nType Ic supernova like SN1998bw, or a dust echo, but such contributions cannot\nbe securely established.",

In contrast to the common believe, in high temperature region of the\nFISDW phase diagram, the hysteresis and, hence, the first order transitions\nwere found to disappear. Nevertheless, sharp changes in the resistivity slope\nare observed both in the low and high temperature domains indicating that the\ncascade of transitions between different subphases exists over all range of the\nFISDW state.

When initially the core and the surface magnetic\nfield are of the same order of magnitude, the rate of flux expulsion from the\ncore is almost independent of the equation of state, and the evolution of the\nsurface field decouples from the core field evolution with increasing\nstiffness. When the surface field is initially much stronger than the core\nfield, the magnetic and rotational evolution resembles to those of a neutron\nstar with a purely crustal field configuration; the only difference is the\noccurence of a residual field. In case of an initially submerged field\nsignificant differences from the standard evolution occur only during the early\nperiod of neutron star's life, until the field has been rediffused to the\nsurface. The reminder of the episode of submergence is a correlation of the\nresidual field strength with the submergence depth of the initial field. We\ndiscuss the effect of the rediffusion of the magnetic field on to the\ndifference between the real and the active age of young pulsars and on their\nbraking indices. Finally, we estimate the shear stresses built up by the moving\nfluxoids at the crust--core interface and show that preferentially in neutron\nstars with a soft equation of state these stresses may cause crust cracking.",

Their (smooth) supergravity solution\nexhibits confinement and the U(1)_R chiral symmetry breaking of the dual YM\ntheory, while the singular solution corresponds to the gauge theory phase with\nunbroken U(1)_R chiral symmetry. In this paper we discuss supersymmetric type\nIIB compactifications on resolved conifolds with torsion. We rederive singular\nbackground of [hep-th/0008001] directly from the supersymmetry conditions. This\nsolution is the relevant starting point to study non-BPS backgrounds dual to\nthe high temperature phase of pure YM. We construct the simplest black hole\nsolution in this background. We argue that it has a regular Schwarzschild\nhorizon and provides a resolution of the IR singularity of the chirally\nsymmetric extremal solution as suggested in [hep-th/0011146].",

The X-ray\nlightcurve shows two dips of ~100 second duration. Detailed time resolved\nspectral analysis shows the existence of three spectral components: a\nmulticolor disk-blackbody, a Comptonized component due to hot plasma and a\npower-law. We find that the Comptonized component is very weak during the dip.\nThis is further confirmed by the PHA ratio of the raw data and ratio of the\nlightcurves in different energy bands. These results, combined with the fact\nthat the 0.5 -- 10 Hz QPO disappears during the dip and that the Comptonized\ncomponent is responsible for the QPO lead to the conclusion that during the\ndips the matter emitting Comptonized spectrum is ejected away. This establishes\na direct connection between the X-ray and radio properties of the source.",

In a search\nfor possible signatures of accretion of metal-rich gas onto the parent stars\n(using HD19994 and published abundances for other stars), it is found that a\nsmall subset of stars with planets exhibit a trend of increasing [X/H] with\nincreasing condensation temperature for a given element X. This trend may point\nto the accretion of chemically fractionated solid material into the outer\n(thin) convection zones of these solar-type stars. It is also found that this\nsmall group of stars exhibiting an accretion signature all have large planets\norbiting much closer than is found, in general, for stars with planets not\nshowing this peculiar abundance trend, suggesting a physical link between\naccretion and orbital separation. In addition, the stars showing evidence of\nfractionated accretion are, on average, of larger mass (1.2Msun) than stars not\nshowing measurable evidence of accretion (1.0Msun).",

For a defocusing\nnonlinearity the stability properties depend sensitively on the response\nfunction profile: for a smooth profile (e.g., a Gaussian) plane waves are\nalways stable, but MI may occur for a rectangular response. We also find that\nthe reduced model for a weak nonlocality predicts MI in defocusing media for\narbitrary response profiles, as long as the intensity exceeds a certain\ncritical value. However, it appears that this regime of MI is beyond the\nvalidity of the reduced model, if it is to represent the weakly nonlocal limit\nof a general nonlocal nonlinearity, as in optics and the theory of\nBose-Einstein condensates.",

As expected, fine structure atomic/ionic emission lines arise\nfrom the bow shocks, at both the Mach Disk and the stagnation tip, where\nJ-shocks are dominant. The H2, H2O and CO molecular emission could arise\nfurther `downstream' at the bow shock wings where the shocks (v = 8-35 km/s)\nare oblique and more likely to be C-type. The 13CO emission arises from\nentrained molecular gas and a compact high velocity emission is observed,\ntogether with an extended low velocity component that almost coincides\nspatially with the H2 near-IR emission. The millimetric continuum emission\nshows two sources. We identify one of them with IRAS 23011+6126, postulating is\nthe driver of the Cepheus E outflow; the other, also an embedded source, is\nlikely to be driving one of other outflows observed in the region.",

As a method of generalizing all interactions among the\nelements of a modal system, an abstract notion of {\\it energy} is introduced,\nand a set of energy transfer functions is provided. Such abstraction leads to a\ndesign where the dynamics of interactions can be largely separated from the\nspecifics of particular modal structures, yielding an easily configurable and\nexpandable system. A real-time version of the framework has been implemented as\na set of C++ classes along with an integrating shell and a GUI, and is\ncurrently being used to design and play modal instruments, as well as to survey\nfundamental properties of various modal algorithms.",

During chaotic inflation, an initial value of\nthe second inflation (new inflation) is set. In this model, the initial value\nof new inflation can be adequately far from the local maximum of the potential\nfor new inflation due to the small linear term of the inflaton in the K\\\"ahler\npotential. Therefore, the primordial fluctuations within the present horizon\nscale may be attributed to both inflations; that is, the first chaotic\ninflation produces the primordial fluctuations on the large cosmological scales\nwhile the second new inflation on the smaller scales. The successive decay of\nthe inflaton for new inflation leads to a reheating temperature low enough to\navoid the overproduction of gravitinos in a wide range of the gravitino mass.",

As further\napplications, we extend Etingof and Gelaki's result that a separable and\ncoseparable Hopf algebra has antipode of order two, the result of Schneider\nthat Hopf subalgebras are twisted Frobenius extensions, and show that the\nquantum double is always a Frobenius algebra.",

We consider in particular the\nstability of the lysogenic state of the lambda prophage, which is known to\nexhibit exceptionally large stability. The formalism defines a quantative\nmeasure of robustness of inherited states.\n  In contrast to Kramers' well-known problem of escape from a potential well,\nthe stability of inherited states in our formulation is not a numerically\ntrivial problem. The most likely exit path does not go along a steepest decent\nof a potential -- there is no potential. Instead, such a path can be described\nas a zero-energy trajectory between two equilibria in an auxiliary classical\nmechanical system. Finding it is similar to e.g. computing heteroclinic orbits\nin celestial mechanics. The overall lesson of this study is that an examination\nof equilibria and their bifurcations with changing parameter values allow us to\nquantify both the stability and the robustness of particular states of a\ngenetic control system.",

To test the proposed method, we perform a series of DWS\nexperiments using colloidal gels as model nonergodic media.

We find that all\nevolutionary models that fit the counts require a flattening at z~0.8 to avoid\noverproducing the CIRB. About 80% of the 140 micron CIRB is produced at 0 < z <\n1.5 while only about 30% of the 850 micron background is produced within the\nsame redshift range. The nature of the evolution is translated into a measure\nof the dust enshrouded star formation rate density as a function of redshift\nand compared with estimates from optical/near-infrared surveys. We find that\nthe dust obscured star formation rate density appears to peak at z=0.8+/-0.1,\nmuch sooner than previously thought, with a value of 0.25+/-0.12 M_sun/yr and\nremains almost constant up to z~2. At least 70% of this star formation takes\nplace in luminous infrared galaxies with L_IR > 10^11 L_sun. The long\nwavelength observations that constrain our evolutionary models do not strongly\ntrace the evolution at z > 2 and a drop off in the dust enshrouded star\nformation rate is consistent with both the CIRB spectrum and the number counts.\nHowever, a comparison with the infrared luminosity function derived from\nextinction corrected optical/UV observations of the Lyman-break galaxy (LBG)\npopulation at z~3 suggests that the flat comoving star formation rate seen\nbetween redshifts 0.8 and 2, extends up to a redshift of z~4.",

The triplet (3Bu+) and even-\nparity singlet (2Ag+) states have a 2-soliton and 4-soliton form, respectively,\nboth with large relaxation energies. The dipole-allowed (1Bu-) state forms an\nexciton-polaron and has a very small relaxation energy. The relaxed energy of\nthe 2Ag+ state lies below that of the 1Bu- state. We observe an attraction\nbetween the soliton-antisoliton pairs in the 2Ag+ state. The calculated\nexcitation energies agree well with the observed values for polyene oligomers;\nthe agreement with polyacetylene thin films is less good, and we comment on the\npossible sources of the discrepencies. The photoinduced absorption is\ninterpreted. The spin-spin correlation function shows that the unpaired spins\ncoincide with the geometrical soliton positions. We study the roles of\nelectron-electron interactions and electron-lattice coupling in determining the\nexcitation energies and soliton structures. The electronic interactions play\nthe key role in determining the ground state dimerisation and the excited state\ntransition energies.",

We discuss properties of these hypothetical\nobjects and their frequency expected in galaxies. We describe a search for such\nobjects using the ROSAT ASS Bright Source Catalog and Faint Source Catalog\n(99528 point-like sources) and the RC3 catalog (16741 spiral and irregular\ngalaxies). Among in total 418 positive correlations in all types of galaxies we\nfind that in S and Irr galaxies 142 sources are unknown as AGNs. We isolated by\nvisual inspection 37 clear non-nuclear, 43 probably non-nuclear and 35 probably\nnuclear sources. The last two classes certainly contain many unknown AGNs. The\nsources of the 1-st class have X-ray luminosities mainly 10^39 - 3 10^41 erg/s.\nTheir observed frequency is about 4% - 5% per S/Irr galaxy, what is in\nagreement with expected frequency of face-on SS433 stars.

For sequences consisting of\ntwo hydrophilic ends with a hydrophobic middle the size distribution of the\nresulting particles is rather narrow, i.e. mesoglobules are being formed.\nHowever, in the case of sequences with two hydrophobic ends and a hydrophilic\nmiddle a new type of structures seems to be prevalent.

Spatial variations in the ratio of CO and\n13CO integrated intensities, R, are found in nearly every galaxy observed.\nThere is an overall variation in R of 20-40% from the inner 2 kpc to the disk.\nRoughly a third of the survey galaxies have such gradients in R detected above\nthe 2-sigma confidence level. Though some galaxies show a lower central value\nof R, on average R inside 2 kpc is 10-30% higher than R outside of 2 kpc.\n  An increase in the CO/13CO intensity ratio from disk to nucleus may imply\nthat the conversion factor between CO intensity and H2 column density, X, is\nlower in galactic nuclei. Also variations in physical conditions, most notably\nthe gas kinetic temperature, affect both R and X. Abundance variations probably\ndo not cause the gradient in R, though we do not rule out a decrease in\neffective cloud column densities in galactic nuclei possibly caused by\ndestructive starburst superwinds. A modest rise in temperature (less than a\nfactor of 2 or 3) from outside a 2 kpc radius towards the nucleus can easily\naccount for the observed gradient. These results support previous work implying\nthat X is lower in the center of the Milky Way and probably most galactic\nnuclei. Therefore calculating H2 masses using the standard Galactic X-factor,\nespecially within the central few kpc of galaxies, overestimates the true mass\nby factors of a few.

The cyclic group of units G_k in Z_k(.) has order\n(p-1)p^{k-1}, implying product structure G_k = A_k B_k. Here core A_k of order\np-1 is an extension for k >1 of Fermat's Small Theorem (FST*), where n^p == n\n(mod p^k) for each core residue, while extension subgroup B_k has order\np^{k-1}. It is shown that each subgroup S >1 of core A_k has zero sum, and that\np+1 generates subgroup B_k of all n == 1 (mod p) in G_k. The p-th power\nresidues n^p mod p^k in G_k form an order |G_k|/p subgroup F_k, with\n|F_k|/|A_k| = p^{k-2}, so F_k properly contains core A_k for k >2. By quadratic\nanalysis (mod p^3) rather than linear analysis (mod p^2, re Hensel's lemma\n[5]), the additive structure of subgroups G_k and F_k is derived. ... Successor\nfunction S(n)=n+1 combines with the two arithmetic symmetries -n (complement)\nand 1/n (inverse) to yield the \"triplet structure\" of G_k : three inverse pairs\n{n_i, 1/(n_i)} with (n_i)+1 = - 1/n_{i+1} (mod p^k), with indices mod 3, and\nproduct n_0.n_1.n_2 = 1 mod p^k.

The redshift of GRB 010222 is therefore\nunambiguously placed at z >= 1.477. The high number of Mg II absorbers and\nespecially the large equivalent widths of the Mg II, Mg I, and Fe II absorption\nlines in the z = 1.477 system further argue either for a very small impact\nparameter or that the z = 1.477 system is the GRB host galaxy itself. The\nspectral index of the OT is relatively steep, beta = 0.89 +/- 0.03, and this\ncannot be caused by dust with a standard Galactic extinction law in the z =\n1.477 absorption system.

The anisotropy in\nthe arrival directions is studied in four dark halo models (cusped, isothermal,\ntriaxial and tilted) and in four galaxy samples (galaxies intrinsically\nbrighter than Centaurus A within 50 and 100 Mpc, and brighter than M32 within\n50 and 100 Mpc). In decaying dark matter models, the amplitude of the\nanisotropy is controlled by the size of the Galactic halo, while the phase is\ncontrolled by the shape. In the northern hemisphere, the amplitude is about 0.5\nfor cusped haloes, but falls to roughly 0.3 for isothermal haloes. The phase\npoints in the direction of the Galactic Centre, with deviations of up to 30\ndegrees possible for triaxial and tilted haloes. The effect of the halo of M31\nis too weak to provide conclusive evidence for the decaying dark matter origin\nof UHECRs. In extragalactic models, samples of galaxies brighter than Centaurus\nA produce substantial anisotropies (roughly 1.8), much larger than the limits\nset by the available data. If all galaxies brighter than M32 contribute, then\nthe anisotropy is more modest (roughly 0.5) and is directed toward mass\nconcentrations in the supergalactic plane, like the Virgo cluster. Predictions\nare made for the southern hemisphere station of the Pierre Auger Observatory.\nIf the UHECRs have a Galactic origin, then the phase points towards the\nGalactic Centre. If they have an extragalactic origin, then it points in the\nrough direction of the Fornax cluster. This provides an unambiguous\ndiscriminant and requires about 350-500 events at South Auger.",

This model leads to a very simple analytic expression for the\nabundance scatter versus Fe/H, which is in good agreement with the data and\nwith more sophisticated numerical models.

On the\nother hand, the entire outer disk, beyond 3.5 kpc radius, shows no HI emission,\nhas a very red colour and exhibits neither radio continuum nor H-alpha\nemission. This indicates that the outer part of NGC 3175 is quiescent, i.e. not\nforming stars at a measurable rate. Its HI deficiency and the small extent of\nthe HI layer, which is confined to the boundaries of the optically visible\ndisk, make NGC 3175 a peculiar spiral galaxy. No intergalactic HI gas in the\nNGC 3175 group was detected in our interferometric observations. Earlier Parkes\ntelescope single dish HI observations put an upper limit on the amount of\ndiffuse gas that might have been missed by the interferometer at 2x10^8 M_sun.\nOn DSS plates no galaxy in the NGC 3175 group of galaxies (Garcia 1993) is\nclose enough to it and none exhibits disturbances that could indicate a close\ninteraction which might have led to the stripping of large parts of its HI gas.\nThus, despite an extensive multi-wavelength investigation, the reason for the\nunusual absence of HI and star formation activity in the outer disk of NGC 3175\nremains an intriguing mystery.",

In this paper we discuss the\ncorrelation for quasars from the FIRST Bright Quasar Survey (FBQS), using black\nhole mass estimates from Hbeta linewidths. The FBQS objects fill in the gap\nbetween the radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars in the radio-luminosity -\noptical-luminosity plane, and we find that they fill the corresponding gap in\nthe M_bh - radio luminosity correlation. There is thus a continuous variation\nof radio luminosity with M_bh, and no evidence for a ``switch'' at some set of\ncritical parameter values which turns on powerful radio jets. By combining the\nFBQS data with that for quasars from the Palomar-Green survey we find evidence\nfor a dependence of radio-luminosity on accretion rate relative to the\nEddington limit, L/L_Edd, as well as on M_bh, consistent with the well-known\nradio-optical correlation for radio-loud quasars. We therefore suggest a new\nscheme to ``unify'' radio-loud and radio-quiet objects in which radio\nluminosity scales proportional to M_bh^{1.9+/-0.2}(L/L_Edd)^{1.0} for\nL/L_Edd~0.1, with an apparently weaker accretion rate dependence at low\nL/L_Edd. The scatter about this relation is +/-1.1 dex, and may well hide\nsignificant contributions from other physical effects, such as black hole spin\nand radio source environment.",

In spite of the small $g_s$, in type II string theories with gauge\ninteractions localized in the vicinity of NS5-branes, the standard model gauge\ncouplings are of order one and are associated with the sizes of compact\ndimensions. At a TeV these theories exhibit higher dimensional and stringy\nbehavior.

To first order\nin the perturbation expansion of the $S$-matrix we derive necessary and\nsufficient conditions for such a theory to be gauge invariant, by which we mean\nthat the gauge variation of the self-coupling with respect to the gauge charge\noperator $Q$ is a divergence in the sense of vector analysis. The most general\ntrilinear self-coupling of the graviton field turns out to be the one derived\nfrom the Einstein-Hilbert action plus coboundaries and divergences.\n  In the second part of this work (sect.9) we consider a massive scalar field\ncoupled to gravity. We are interested in the long range behaviour of this\ntheory. Radiative corrections for two particle scattering are investigated in\nthe adiabatic limit, where the cutoff of the interaction at infinity is\nremoved. We compute the differential cross section for graviton bremsstrahlung\nin which one of the scattered particles emits a graviton of low energy. It is\nshown that such processes are logarithmically divergent in the adiabatic limit.\nFurthermore we show that the differential cross section for two particle\nscattering with a graviton self-energy insertion is finite in the adiabatic\nlimit while for matter self-energy it is logarithmically divergent, too.",

Conversely, if we know the cosmological model parameters from other\nmeasurements, the cluster abundance evolution permits us to probe features in\nthe power spectrum that are in the nonlinear regime at the present epoch, and\nhence difficult to discern directly from current epoch measurements.\n  We have investigated the influence of an artificially introduced Gaussian\nfeature on an otherwise unperturbed SCDM power spectrum. Using these modified\nspectra as an input to cosmological N-body simulations, we are able to show\nthat in terms of the cluster abundance evolution, a SCDM model displays\ncharacteristics similar to an OCDM model. However, strong modifications would\nalso be visible at a redshift z=0 in the dark matter power spectrum whereas\nminor alterations to the usual SCDM spectrum are washed away by non-linear\nevolution effects. We therefore conclude that features with characteristics\nsuch as discussed here might not be detectable using observations of the galaxy\npower spectrum, the local cluster abundance or the large-scale velocity field\nas measured by the velocity distribution of galaxy clusters. The only quantity\nthat shows a pronounced difference at the present epoch between our models\nunder investigation is the halo-halo correlation function which appears to be\nstrongly biased with respect to an unmodified SCDM model. This is due to a lack\nof power on certain scales which subsequently modifies the relative amplitude\nof high-and low-k waves.

An\nimportant feature of this calculus, which we call filtered stochastic calculus,\nis that it provides an explicit interpolation between the main types of\ncalculi, regardless of the type of independence, including freeness, Boolean\nindependence (more generally, m-freeness) as well as tensor independence.\nMoreover, it shows how boson calculus is ``deformed'' by other noncommutative\nnotions of independence.",

The\nalternate supply of As2 molecules and Ga and Mn atoms made it possible to grow\nsingle crystalline GaMnAs layers at very low substrate temperature, at which\nconventional molecular beam epitaxial growth under excess As supply is not\npossible due to As condensation. Secondary ion mass spectroscopy and X-ray\ndiffraction measurements confirmed a higher Mn content in the films grown by\nthis method in comparison to the GaMnAs layers grown by low temperature\nmolecular beam epitaxy. The lattice constant of hypothetical zinc-blende\nstructure MnAs is determined to be 5.9 \\AA, which deviates somewhat from\npreviously reported values. This deviation is ascribed to growth-condition\ndependent density of point defects.

Otherwise we, like them, follow Kalnajs' programme to simultaneously\nsolve the Boltzmann and Poisson equations.\n  We investigate the modes admitted by both the self-consistent and a cut-out\nMestel disk, the difference being that in the latter, a part of the matter in\nthe disk is immobilised. This breaks the self-similarity and produces a\npronouncedly different picture, both technically and in terms of the disk\nproperties. The self-consistent disk is governed by a Cauchy integral equation,\nthe cut-out disk by an integral equation that can be treated as a Fredholm\nequation of the second kind.\n  In general, our approximation reproduces the results of the previous works\nremarkably well, yielding quantities mostly within 5% of the values reported by\nZang and Evans & Read and thus also the basic result that in a ``standard''\ncut-out disk, only one-armed modes are unstable at the limit of axisymmetric\nstability. In the self-consistent disk, relatively compact expressions for the\nkernel allow an intuitive understanding of most of the properties of neutral\n(non-rotating, non-growing) modes there. We finally show that self-consistent\nMestel disks do not admit growing or rotating modes in this sort of\nstellar-dynamical analysis.",

We\ndisplay images of the spatial distribution of galaxies in the simulations that\nillustrate its evolution and provide a qualitative understanding of the\nprocesses responsible for various biases that develop. We consider three\nspecific statistical measures of clustering at z=1 and z=0: the correlation\nlength (in real- and redshift-space) of galaxies of different luminosity, the\nmorphology-density relation and the genus curve of the topology of galaxy\nisodensity surfaces. For galaxies with luminosity below L*, the z=0 correlation\nlength depends very little on the luminosity of the sample, but for brighter\ngalaxies it increases very rapidly, reaching values in excess of 10Mpc/h. The\n\"accelerated\" dynamical evolution experienced by galaxies in rich clusters,\nwhich is partly responsible for this effect, also results in a strong\nmorphology-density relation. Remarkably, this relation is already\nwell-established at z=1. The genus curves of the galaxies are significantly\ndifferent from the genus curves of the dark matter but this is not due to\ngenuine topological differences but rather to the sparse sampling of the\ndensity field provided by galaxies. The predictions of our model at z=0 will be\ntested by forthcoming data from the 2dF and Sloan galaxy surveys, and those at\nz=1 by the DEEP and VIRMOS surveys.",

The field equation turns out to have a form completely similar\nto the Maxwell field equation $d*\\F^a=\\T^a$. By applying the Noether procedure,\nthe source 3-form $\\T^a$ is shown to be connected with the diffeomorphism\ninvariance of the Lagrangian. Thus the source of the coframe field is\ninterpreted as the total conserved energy-momentum current of the system. A\nreduction of the conserved current to the Noether current and the Noether\ncharge for the coframe field is provided. An energy-momentum tensor for the\ncoframe field is defined in a diffeomorphism invariant and a translational\ncovariant way. The total energy-momentum current of a system is conserved. Thus\na redistribution of the energy-momentum current between material and coframe\n(gravity) field is possible in principle, unlike as in GR. The energy-momentum\ntensor is calculated for various teleparallel models: the pure Yang-Mills type\nmodel, the anti-Yang-Mills type model and the generalized teleparallel\nequivalent of GR.

We find that, for a cosmology with Omega_M=0.3\nand Omega_Lambda=0.7, about one in twenty lens systems consist of two lenses\nwith merging caustics. Multiple lens systems differ from single lenses. They\nhave a larger multiple imaging cross section and significantly differ in the\nimage configuration. The external shear induced by a nearby galaxy, group or\ncluster can affect image positions even for more widely separated lens pairs.\nBoth of these effects must be accounted for in lens modelling. We also show how\nthe presence of aligned discs in the pair of lensing galaxies can lead to very\nlarge high-magnification cross sections. Multiple lens systems will be\nimportant in future, both for constraining lens models of individual systems\nand for statistical lensing.",

Axially symmetric collapse of\ncollisionless dark matter can leave observable caustic rings in phase space and\nthis model is frequently used to make experimental predictions (Sikivie 1999).\nSuch cold collapses inevitably suffer from radial orbit instabilities that\nproduce unrealistic bar-like halos. Moreover, this model bears no relation to\nthe hierarchical growth of CDM galactic halos which form via a complicated\nsequence of mergers and violent relaxation. This process destroys any symmetry\nand phase wraps existing caustics on a scale comparable to the first objects to\ncollapse. Since axions can cluster on microscopic scales and free streaming of\nneutralinos only erases structure smaller than \\sim 100 (GeV/m_{CDM}) A.U., the\ndynamical effects of caustics in the Galactic halo are expected to be\nnegligible.",

    "summary": "The 2D quasi-geostrophic (QG) equation is a two dimensional model of the 3D\nincompressible Euler equations. When dissipation is included in the model then\nsolutions always exist if the dissipation's wave number dependence is\nsuper-linear. Below this critical power the dissipation appears to be\ninsufficient. For instance, it is not known if the critical dissipative QG\nequation has global smooth solutions for arbitrary large initial data. In this\npaper we prove existence and uniqueness of global classical solutions of the\ncritical dissipative QG equation for initial data that have small $L^\\infty$\nnorm. The importance of an $L^{\\infty}$ smallness condition is due to the fact\nthat $L^{\\infty}$ is a conserved norm for the non-dissipative QG equation and\nis non-increasing on all solutions of the dissipative QG., irrespective of\nsize.",

The primary results include:\n(1) The relative ages of binary star components are more similar than the\nrelative ages of randomly paired single stars, supporting coeval formation. (2)\nOnly one of the companion masses is substellar, and hence the apparent\noverabundance of T Tauri star companions relative to main-sequence star\ncompanions can not be explained by a wealth of substellar secondaries that\nwould have been missed in main-sequence surveys. (3) Roughly 10% of T Tauri\nbinary star components have very red NIR colors (K-L > 1.4) and unusually high\nmass accretion rates. This phenomenon does not appear to be restricted to\nbinary systems, however, since a comparable fraction of single T Tauri stars\nexhibit the same properties. (4) Although the disk lifetimes of single stars\nare roughly equal to their stellar ages, the disk lifetimes of binary stars are\nan order of magnitude less than their ages. (5) The accretion rates for both\nsingle and binary T Tauri stars appear to be moderately mass dependent. (6)\nAlthough most classical T Tauri star binaries retain both a circumprimary and a\ncircumsecondary disk, there are several systems with only a circumprimary disk.\nTogether with the relative accretion rates, this suggests that circumprimary\ndisks survive longer, on average, than circumsecondary disks. (7) The disk\nlifetimes, mass ratios, and relative accretion signatures of the closest\nbinaries (10-100 AU) suggest that they are being replenished from a\ncircumbinary reservoir with low angular momentum. Overall, these results\nsupport fragmentation as the dominant binary star formation mechanism.",

The traces are computed in the\nsemiclassical regime (where disorder is weak) and, more importantly, in the\nnonperturbative transport regime (including the region around\nlocalization-delocalization transition) where concept of mean free path ceases\nto exist. Since quantum interference effects for such strong disorder are not\namenable to diagrammatic or nonlinear $\\sigma$-model techniques, the evolution\nof different Green function terms with disorder strength provides novel insight\ninto the development of an Anderson localized phase.",

We develop a simple analytical approach, allowing\nalso for the effects of photon-photon pair production, and explore the\nconditions under which one or the other of these components dominates. We\nidentify three parameter space regions where different spectral components\ndominate: (I) a region where the proton synchrotron and other hadron-related\nemission components dominate, which is small; (II) a region where the electron\ninverse Compton component dominates, which is substantial; (III) a third\nsubstantial region where electron synchrotron dominates. We discuss the\nprospects and astrophysical implications of directly detecting the inverse\nCompton and the proton high energy components in various bands, in particular\nin the GeV band with future missions such as GLAST, and in the X-ray band with\nChandra. We find that regime II parameter space is the most favorable regime\nfor high energy emission.

To\nclarify the first issue, we establish two independent methods for estimating a\nparameter of LCE ($f$), which is defined as the fraction of Lyman continuum\nphotons contributing to hydrogen ionization in an H {\\sc ii} region. One of\nthose methods determines $f$ from the set of Lyman continuum flux, electron\ndensity and metallicity. In the framework of this method, as the metallicity\nand/or the Lyman photon flux increase, $f$ is found to decrease. The other\nmethod determines $f$ from the ratio of infrared flux to Lyman continuum flux.\nImportantly, we show that $f \\la 0.5$ via both methods in many H {\\sc ii}\nregions of the Galaxy. Thus, it establishes that dust in such H {\\sc ii}\nregions absorbs significant amount of Lyman continuum photons directly. To\nexamine the second issue, we approximate $f$ to a function of only the\ndust-to-gas mass ratio (i.e., metallicity), assuming a parameter fit for the\nGalactic H {\\sc ii} regions. We find that a characteristic $\\hat{f}$, which is\ndefined as $f$ averaged over a galaxy-wide scale, is 0.3 for the nearby spiral\ngalaxies. This relatively small $\\hat{f}$ indicates that a typical increment\nfactor due to LCE for estimating the global SFR ($1/\\hat{f}$) is large ($\\sim\n3$) for the nearby spiral galaxies. Therefore, we conclude that the effect of\nLCE is not negligible relative to other uncertainties of estimating the SFR of\ngalaxies.",

As a specific example, we consider\nsolutions of the Seiberg-Witten Monopole Equations in which the U(1) fields are\ncovariantly constant, the monopole Weyl spinor has only a single constant\ncomponent, and the 4-manifold M_4 is a product of two Riemann surfaces\nSigma_{p_1} and Sigma_{p_2}.

There is evidence that MFs are powered\nby catastrophic magnetic instabilities in ultramagnetized neutron stars. These\nevents begin with brief (~ 0.1 - 1 s), intense, hard spikes of gamma rays\nfollowed by long (~ 100 s) softer tails of hard X-rays, modulated on the\nstellar rotation period. Prototypical MFs could have been detected by BATSE out\nto ~ 13 Mpc, nearly reaching the Virgo cluster. The likely number of isotropic,\nstandard-candle MFs detected by the BATSE experiment is ~ 12. Bayes' Theorem\nimplies that there is a 99% chance for at least 1 MF in the BATSE catalog, and\na 16% chance for more than 20. These short-duration, fast-rising gamma-ray\nbursts could in principle be identified by their positional coincidences with\nnearby galaxies. The ensuing soft tail emission would not have been detected by\nBATSE for sources more distant than M31.\n  It is possible that MFs also emit an intense, hard, BEAMED component during\nthe intial spike phase. If this beamed component has opening angle ~ 8 degrees\nand peak luminosity comparable to the power of the isotropic component, then\nBATSE would detect such beamed sources out to redshift z ~ 0.1, at a full-sky\nrate of ~ 100 yr^-1. We speculate that such beamed MFs could account for the\nshort, hard Class II gamma-ray bursts in the BATSE catalog, or some significant\nsubset of them. If true, then Class II GRBs positions would correlate with the\npositions of galaxies and galaxy clusters within ~ 350 Mpc.",

We combine both proprietary and\narchival HST data obtained with the FOC, WFPC2 and STIS. The low resolution\nnear-UV prism FOC spectrum obtained at day 3043 has not been described\npreviously. Although the FWHM of the ejecta grew linearly over the time span\nstudied, the appearance of the SN envelope also changed markedly with\nwavelength. At visible wavelengths (lambda ~ 5000 Angstrom) the ejecta became\nprogressively more elongated, reaching an ellipticity epsilon ~ 0.25 by day\n4000. In the near-UV (lambda ~ 2500 AA), the ejecta remained closely circular\n(epsilon <= 0.1) and ~ 50% larger in angular extent than in the visible. The\nFOC prism observations show that the large extent of the SN envelope is\nconfined to a grouping of resonance lines spanning Mg I 2852, Mg II 2795,2802\nand several Fe II multiplets -- thereby confirming that the larger size of the\ndebris in the near-UV is due to scattering in these optically thick transitions\ncompared to the optically thin forbidden and semi-forbidden transitions that\ndominate the visible spectrum.

Considering an extreme Kerr black hole, we show that the large\nnumber of virtually undamped quasinormal modes (that exist for nonzero values\nof the azimuthal eigenvalue m) combine in such a way that the field (as\nobserved at infinity) oscillates with an amplitude that decays as 1/t at late\ntimes. This is in clear contrast with the standard late time power-law fall-off\nfamiliar from studies of non-rotating black holes. This long-lived oscillating\n``tail'' will, however, not be present for non-extreme (presumably more\nastrophysically relevant) black holes, for which we find that many quasinormal\nmodes (individually excited to a very small amplitude) combine to give rise to\nan exponentially decaying field. This result could have implications for the\ndetection of gravitational-wave signals from rapidly spinning black holes,\nsince the required theoretical templates need to be constructed from linear\ncombinations of many modes. Our main results are obtained analytically, but we\nsupport the conclusions with numerical time-evolutions of the Teukolsky\nequation. These time-evolutions provide an interesting insight into the notion\nthat the quasinormal modes can be viewed as waves trapped in the spacetime\nregion outside the horizon. They also suggest that a plausible mechanism for\nthe behaviour we observe for extreme black holes is the presence of a\n``superradiance resonance cavity'' immediately outside the black hole.",

    "summary": "I review our knowledge of the properties of the host galaxies of radio-loud\nand radio-quiet quasars, both in comparison to each other and in the context of\nthe general galaxy population. It is now clear that the hosts of radio-loud and\nradio-quiet quasars with M_V < -23.5 are virtually all massive elliptical\ngalaxies. The masses of these spheroids are as expected given the relationship\nbetween black-hole and spheroid mass found for nearby quiescent galaxies, as is\nthe growing prevalence of disc components in the hosts of progressively fainter\nAGN. There is also now compelling evidence that quasar hosts are practically\nindistinguishable from normal ellipticals, both in their basic structural\nparameters and in the old age of their dominant stellar populations; at low z\nthe nuclear activity is not associated with the formation of a significant\nfraction of the host galaxy. While the long-held view that quasar radio power\nmight be a simple function of host morphology is now dead and buried, I argue\nthat host-galaxy studies may yet play a crucial role in resolving the\nlong-standing problem of the origin of radio loudness. Specifically there is\ngrowing evidence that radio-loud objects are powered by more massive black\nholes accreting at lower efficiency than their radio-quiet couterparts of\ncomparable optical output. A black-hole mass > 10^9 solar masses appears to be\na necessary (although perhaps not sufficient) condition for the production of\nradio jets of sufficient power to produce an FRII radio source within a massive\ngalaxy halo.",

    "summary": "The properties of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and their afterglows are used to\ninvestigate the location of star formation activity through the history of the\nUniverse. This approach is motivated by the following: (i) GRBs are thought to\nbe associated with the deaths of massive stars and so the GRB rate ought to\nfollow the massive star formation rate, (ii) GRBs are the final evolutionary\nphase of these short-lived stars, which do not travel far from their\nbirthplace, and so should be located where the stars formed, and (iii) The\ndifferential effects of dust extinction on GRB afterglows between the X-ray and\noptical wavebands can reveal whether or not large amounts of gas and dust are\npresent in GRB host galaxies. From recent evidence, we estimate that a\nsignificant fraction (about 75%) of stars in the Universe formed in galaxies\nthat are brightest at rest-frame far-infrared (IR) wavelengths. This value is\nmarginally consistent with observations: 60 +/- 15% of GRBs have no detected\noptical afterglow, whereas almost all have an X-ray afterglow. If the X-ray\nafterglows of a large number of GRBs disappear at soft X-ray wavelengths (<2\nkeV), then this would provide strong evidence for dominant heavily obscured\nstar-formation activity. Far-IR and submillimetre studies of GRB hosts would\nalso test this idea: about 20% of hosts should be detectable using SCUBA.",

We find\nthat the luminosity function is close to the low redshift 12 micron luminosity\nfunction determined by IRAS (Fang et al., 1998; Rush et al., 1993), but with a\npossible excess at the highest luminosities, which also correspond to the\nhighest redshifts. This excess is compatible with the rapid luminosity\nevolution of L ~ (1+z)^{4.5} claimed by Xu (2000) and suggested by Elbaz (1999)\non the basis of number counts. These conclusions remain tentative because of\nsmall number statistics at the highest redshifts. Almost all of the galaxies in\nthis survey are emission line objects. We use the spectra to determine emission\nline diagnostics for the underlying ionisation source. We find that the\nmajority of objects have HII region-like spectra (roughly 2/3) but there is a\nsignificant fraction (about 1/3) that contain an AGN. This confirms suspicions\nthat deep mid-IR surveys will be a powerful way to find obscured AGN. Part of\nthe survey area has been imaged deeply by the INT Wide Field Camera. Nearly all\n12 micron sources in this area have good optical identifications. The prospects\nare thus good for obtaining complete spectroscopy.",

    "summary": "We calculate nucleosynthesis in core-collapse explosions of massive Pop III\nstars, and compare the results with abundances of metal-poor halo stars to\nconstrain the parameters of Pop III supernovae. We focus on iron-peak elements\nand, in particular, we try to reproduce the large [Zn/Fe] observed in extremely\nmetal-poor stars. The interesting trends of the observed ratios [Zn, Co, Mn,\nCr, V/Fe] can be related to the variation of the relative mass of the complete\nand incomplete Si-burning regions in supernova ejecta. We find that [Zn/Fe] is\nlarger for deeper mass-cuts, smaller neutron excess, and larger explosion\nenergies. The large [Zn/Fe] and [O/Fe] observed in the very metal-poor halo\nstars suggest deep mixing of complete Si-burning material and a significant\namount of fall-back in Type II supernovae. Furthermore, large explosion\nenergies (E_51 >~ 2 for M ~ 13 Msun and E_51 >~ 20 for M >~ 20 Msun) are\nrequired to reproduce [Zn/Fe] ~ 0.5. The observed trends of the abundance\nratios among the iron-peak elements are better explained with this high energy\n(``Hypernova'') models rather than the simple ``deep'' mass-cut effect, because\nthe overabundance of Ni can be avoided in the hypernova models. We also present\nthe yields of pair-instability supernova explosions of M = 130 - 300 Msun\nstars, and discuss that the abundance features of very metal-poor stars cannot\nbe explained by pair-instability supernovae.",

Our results show that there\nis an energy interval - between 12 and 15 eV per condensing SiO$_2$ unit on\naverage - for which the growth leads to a dense, low-stress amorphous\nstructure, in satisfactory agreement with the results of low-energy ion-beam\nexperiments. We also find that the crossover between low- and high-density\nfilms is associated with a tensile to compressive stress transition, and a\nsimultaneous healing of structural defects of the {\\em a-}SiO$_2$ network,\nnamely three- and four-fold rings. It is observed, finally, that densification\nproceeds through significant changes at intermediate length scales (4--10 \\AA),\nleaving essentially unchanged the ``building blocks'' of the network, viz. the\nSi(O$_{1/2}$)$_{4}$ tetrahedra.

The observations, short-exposured photographic plates and CCD\nframes, were obtained in the RC-focus of the 2m telescope of the Natl. Astron.\nObs. 'Rozhen'. All stars in an annulus with radius 1 < r < 5.5 arcmin were\nmeasured. We show that the UV CMDs describe different evolutionary stages in a\nbetter manner than the 'classical' (V, B-V) diagram. We use HB stars, with\nknown spectroscopic Teff, to check the validity of the colour zero-point. A\nreview of all known UV-bright star candidates in M5 is made and some of their\nparameters are catalogued. Six new stars of this kind are suspected on the\nbasis of their position on the CMD. New assessment of the cluster reddening and\nmetallicity is done using the (U-B, B-V) diagram. We find [Fe/H]= -1.38, which\nconfirms the Zinn & West (1984) value contrasting with recent spectroscopic\nestimates. In an effort to clarify the question of the gap in the BHB stellar\ndistribution and to investigate some other peculiarities, we use the relatively\nlong-base colour index U-V. A comparison of the unreddened (V, U-V)\ndistribution of HB stars with a canonical ZAHB model (Dorman et al. 1993)\nreveals that the hottest stars rise above the model line. We find this similar\nto the 'u-jump' found in the Stroemgren photometry (Grundahl et al. 1998,\n1999). (U-B)o indeces of 18 BHB stars with (B-V)o in [-0.02, 0.18] were used to\nestimate their ultraviolet deficiency.

This model is gauge invariant, unlike massive-photon theories based on\nthe Proca equation, and it predicts anisotropy of both the speed of light and\nthe electric field of a point charge. The latter leads to an orientation\ndependence of the length of solid bodies which must be accounted for when\ninterpreting the results of a Michelson-Morley experiment. Using a simple model\nof ionic solids we show that, in principle, the effect of orientation dependent\nlength can conspire to cancel the effect of an anisotropic speed of light in a\nMichelson-Morley experiment, thus, complicating the interpretation of the\nresults.",

We consider the case when the symmetry is\nrepresented by a quantum number that takes one of two possible values, so that\nthe unperturbed system has a spectrum composed of two independent sequences.\nWhen symmetry-breaking perturbation is represented by a random matrix with an\nadjustable strength, the shape of the spectrum monotonously evolves towards the\nWigner distribution as the strength parameter increases. This contradicts the\nobserved behaviour of the acoustic resonance spectra in quartz blocks during\nthe breaking of a point-group symmetry that has two eigenvalues, where the\nsystem changes in the beginning towards the Poisson statistics then turns back\nto the GOE statistics. This behaviour is explained by assuming that the\nsymmetry breaking perturbation removes the degeneracy of a limited number of\nlevels, thus creating a third chaotic sequence. As symmetry breaking increases,\nthe new sequence grows at the expense of the initial pair until it overwhelms\nthe whole spectrum when the symmetry completely disappears. The calculated\nspacing distribution and spectral rigidity are able to describe the evolution\nof the observed acoustic resonance spectra.",

We then motivate a gauge-invariant\nseparation into a generalized Born term containing ground-state properties\nonly, and a residual contribution describing the model-dependent internal\nstructure. The generalized dipole polarizabilities are defined in terms of\nLorentz-invariant residual amplitudes. Particular emphasis is laid on a\nphysical interpretation of these quantities as characterizing the spatial\ndistributions of the induced electric polarization and magnetization of\nhadrons. It is argued that three dipole polarizabilities, namely the\nlongitudinal electric alpha_L(q^2), the transverse electric alpha_T(q^2), and\nthe magnetic beta(q^2) ones are required in order to fully reconstruct local\npolarizations induced by soft external fields in a hadron. One of these\npolarizabilities, alpha_T(q^2), describes an effect of higher order in the soft\nfinal-photon momentum q'. We argue that the associated spatial distributions\nobtained via the Fourier transforms in the Breit frame are meaningful even for\nsuch a light particle as the pion.

If\nthis heating is counteracted by cooling due to inverse Compton scattering of\nthe same radio radiation, then the plasma can be heated up to mildly\nrelativistic temperatures kT~10--100 keV. The stationary electron velocity\ndistribution can be either relativistic Maxwellian or quasi-Maxwellian (with\nthe high-velocity tail suppressed), depending on the efficiency of Coulomb\ncollisions and other relaxation processes. We derive several easy-to-use\napproximate expressions for the induced Compton heating rate of mildly\nrelativistic electrons in an isotropic radiation field, as well as for the\nstationary distribution function and temperature of electrons.

The\ninduced spacetime has curvature only up to a radius that depends on the energy\nof the incident string. Outside that region (`bubble') the spacetime is matched\nwith the Minkowski spacetime. The interior of the bubble is consistent with the\neffective field theory obtained from strings, with non-trivial tachyon-like and\nantisymmetric tensor fields (in four dimensions the latter gives rise to an\naxion pseudoscalar field). The tachyonic mode, however, does not represent the\nstandard flat-spacetime string tachyon, but merely expresses the instability of\nthe distorted spacetime. Due to the non-trivial matter content of the interior\nof the bubble, there is entropy production, which expresses the fact that\ninformation is carried away by the recoil degrees of freedom. We also\ndemonstrate that a particle can be captured by the bubble, depending on the\nparticle's impact parameter. This will result in information loss for an\nexternal asymptotic observer, corresponding to production of entropy\npropotional to the area of the bubble. For the validity of our approach it is\nessential that the string length is a few orders of magnitude larger than the\nPlanck length, which is a typical situation encountered in many D-brane-world\nmodels.

The technique\nutilizes the fact that Monte Carlo simulations track individual photon packets,\nso we may easily determine where their energy is absorbed. When a packet is\nabsorbed, it heats a particular cell within the envelope, raising its\ntemperature. To enforce radiative equilibrium, the absorbed packet is\nimmediately re-emitted. To correct the cell temperature, the frequency of the\nre-emitted packet is chosen so that it corrects the temperature of the spectrum\npreviously emitted by the cell. The re-emitted packet then continues being\nscattered, absorbed, and re-emitted until it finally escapes from the envelope.\nAs the simulation runs, the envelope heats up, and the emergent spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) relaxes to its equilibrium value, without iteration. This\nimplies that the equilibrium temperature calculation requires no more\ncomputation time than the SED calculation of an equivalent pure scattering\nmodel with fixed temperature. In addition to avoiding iteration, our method\nconserves energy exactly, because all injected photon packets eventually\nescape. Furthermore, individual packets transport energy across the entire\nsystem because they are never destroyed. This long-range communication, coupled\nwith the lack of iteration, implies that our method does not suffer the\nconvergence problems commonly associated with lambda-iteration. To verify our\ntemperature correction procedure, we compare our results to standard benchmark\ntests, and finally we present the results of simulations for two-dimensional\naxisymmetric density structures.",

Chi_s\njumps across the phase transition temperature, T_c, and grows rapidly with\ntemperature above but close to T_c. For all quark masses and susceptibilities\nin the entire temperature range studied, we found significant departures from\nideal-gas values. We also observed a strong correlation between these\nquantities and the susceptibility in the scalar/pseudo-scalar channel,\nsupporting ideas of ``dynamical confinement'' in the high temperature phase of\nthe QCD plasma.",

    "summary": "Several situations of physical importance may be modelled by linear quantum\nfields propagating in fixed spacetime-dependent classical background fields.\nFor example, the quantum Dirac field in a strong and/or time-dependent external\nelectromagnetic field accounts for the creation of electron-positron pairs out\nof the vacuum. Also, the theory of linear quantum fields propagating on a given\nbackground curved spacetime is the appropriate framework for the derivation of\nblack-hole evaporation (Hawking effect) and for studying the question whether\nor not it is possible in principle to manufacture a time-machine. It is a\nwell-established metatheorem that any question concerning such a linear quantum\nfield may be reduced to a definite question concerning the corresponding\nclassical field theory (i.e. linear hyperbolic PDE with non-constant\ncoefficients describing the background in question) -- albeit not necessarily a\nquestion which would have arisen naturally in a purely classical context. The\nfocus in this talk will be on the covariant Klein-Gordon equation in a fixed\ncurved background, although we shall draw on analogies with other background\nfield problems and with the time-dependent harmonic oscillator. The aim is to\ngive a sketch-impression of the whole subject of Quantum Field Theory in Curved\nSpacetime, focussing on work with which the author has been personally\ninvolved, and also to mention some ideas and work-in-progress by the author and\ncollaborators towards a new \"semi-local\" vacuum construction for this subject.\nA further aim is to introduce, and set into context, some recent advances in\nour understanding of the general structure of quantum fields in curved\nspacetimes which rely on classical results from microlocal analysis.",

The SCF quantifies the correlation\nbetween spectra at different map positions as a function of their separation,\nand is sensitive to the properties of both the gas mass distribution and the\ngas velocity field. It is likely that spatial correlation properties of the gas\ndensity and velocity fields in a galactic disk are sensitive to the value of\nthe scale height of the gas disk. A scale-free turbulent cascade is unlikely to\nextend to scales much larger than the disk scale height, as the disk dynamics\non those larger scales should be dominated by two dimensional motions.\n  We find a clear feature in the SCF of the LMC HI disk, on the scale of\napproximately 180 pc, which we identify as the disk scale height. We are also\ntentatively able to map variations of the scale height over the disk.",

However, vacuum polarization significantly modifies the spectra for\nB~10^15 G, giving rise to power-law tails at high photon energies. The\nangle-dependence (beaming) of the emerging intensity has two maxima: a narrow\n(pencil) peak at small angles (<5 degrees) with respect to the normal and a\nbroad maximum (fan beam) at intermediate angles (~20-60 degrees).

Even when these corrections are made there remains a\nsignificant discrepancy between SFRs derived from UV and H-alpha measurements\ncompared with those derived from far-infrared (FIR) and radio luminosities.\nSince the FIR/radio derived SFRs are not affected by extinction, and simple\ncorrections to reconcile the UV and H-alpha measurement with these do not fully\naccount for the discrepancies, a more sophisticated correction may be required.\nRecent results suggest that at least part of the solution may be a form of\nextinction which increases with increasing SFR (or luminosity, given the common\nassumption that SFR is proportional to luminosity). We present an analysis of\nthe effects of a dust reddening dependent on star formation rate applied to\nestimators of SFR. We show (1) that the discrepancies between H-alpha and\nFIR/radio SFR estimates may be explained by such an effect, and we present an\niterative method for applying the correction; and (2) UV-based estimates of SFR\nare harder to reconcile with FIR/radio estimates using this method, although\nthe extent of the remaining discrepancy is less than for a non-SFR-dependent\ncorrection.

These solutions possess generic local\nanisotropy, and their local isotropic limit is shown to be conformally\nequivalent to the spherically symmetric 5D solutions of gr-qc/9807086. The\nanisotropic solutions investigated here have two physically distinct\nsignatures: First, they can give rise to angular-dependent, anisotropic\n``electromagnetic'' interactions. Second, they can result in a gravitational\nrunning of the ``electric'' and ``magnetic'' charges of the solutions. This\ngravitational running of the electromagnetic charges is linear rather than\nlogarithmic, and could thus serve as an indirect signal for the presence of\nhigher dimensions. The local anisotropy of these solutions is modeled using the\ntechnique of anholonomic frames with respect to which the metrics are\ndiagonalized. If holonomic coordinates frames were used then such metrics would\nhave off-diagonal components.",

Most of the allowed solutions are\nrobust with respect to changes in the analysis procedure, but the traditional\nvacuum solution is fragile. The globally-permitted range of the 8B neutrino\nflux, 0.45 to 1.95 in units of the BP2000 flux, is comparable to the 3 sigma\nrange allowed by the standard solar model. We discuss the implications for SNO\nof a low mass, Delta m^2 ~ 6 times 10^{-12} eV^2, vacuum oscillation solution,\npreviously found by Raghavan, and by Krastev and Petcov, but absent in recent\nanalyses that included Super-Kamiokande data. For the SNO experiment, we\npresent refined predictions for the charged-current rate and the ratio of the\nneutral-current rate to charged-current rate. The predicted charged-current\nrate can be clearly distinguished from the no-oscillation rate only for the LMA\nsolution.

Our\nhigh-resolution smoothed particle hydrodynamical simulations are designed to\ndetermine whether or not hypothesized supergiant molecular clouds (SGMCs) form\nand, if they do, to determine their physical properties and mass spectra. It\nwas suggested in earlier work that clouds with a median mass of several 10^8\nM_sun are expected to assemble during the formation of a galaxy, and that\nglobular clusters form within these SGMCs. Our simulations show that clouds\nwith the predicted properties are indeed produced as smaller clouds collide and\nagglomerate within the merging dark matter haloes of our cosmological model. We\nfind that the mass spectrum of these clouds obeys the same power-law form\nobserved for globular clusters, molecular clouds, and their internal clumps in\ngalaxies, and predicted for the supergiant clouds in which globular clusters\nmay form. We follow the evolution and physical properties of gas clouds within\nsmall dark matter haloes up to z = 1, after which prolific star formation is\nexpected to occur. Finally, we discuss how our results may lead to more\nphysically motivated \"rules\" for star formation in cosmological simulations of\ngalaxy formation.",

The hole gas in the Ge QW has been found to separate into two\nsublayers for d_w > ~35 nm and p_s = ~5x10^{15} m^{-2}. A dramatic indication\nto this separation is the disappearance of the quantum Hall (QH) plateau for\nthe filling factor nu = 1 as calculated for the whole Ge layer.

A comparison of the simulated structure of the QH\nmagnetoresistivity with the experimental one indicates that the hole densities\nin the sublayers are not much different.

In the QWs of intermediate widths and hole\ndensities, this negative magnetoresistance may be explained as being caused by\nsuppression of the intersubband scattering due to the upper subband\ndepopulation. For the widest QWs with the highest hole densities, in which the\nhole gas is divided into two sublayers, similar negative magnetoresistance was\nobserved and tentatively interpreted as also been due to suppression of the\nintersubband scattering, but subbands are the lowest symmetric and\nantisymmetric states of the double quantum well structure. These subbands shift\nunder the in-plane magnetic field not vertically in energy, but horizontally\nalong the wave vector.",

Such an X-ray\nlaser would allow for high-field science applications: One could make use of\nnot only the high energy and transverse coherence of the X-ray beam, but also\nof the possibility of focusing it to a spot with a small radius, hopefully in\nthe range of the laser wavelength. Along this route one obtains very large\nelectric fields, much larger than those obtainable with any optical laser of\nthe same power. In this letter we discuss the possibility of obtaining an\nelectric field so high that electron-positron pairs are spontaneously produced\nin vacuum (Schwinger pair production). We find that if X-ray optics can be\nimproved to approach the diffraction limit of focusing, and if the power of the\nplanned X-ray FELs can be increased to the terawatt region, then there is ample\nroom for an investigation of the Schwinger pair production mechanism.",

    "summary": "The Davies-Fulling (DF) model describes the scattering of a massless field by\na non-inertial mirror in two dimensions. In this paper, we generalize this\nmodel in two different ways. First, we consider partially reflecting mirrors.\nWe show that the Bogoliubov coefficients relating inertial modes can be\nexpressed in terms of the frequency dependent reflection factor which is\nspecified in the rest frame of the mirror and the transformation from the\ninertial modes to the modes at rest with respect to the mirror. In this\nperspective, the DF model is simply the limiting case when this factor is unity\nfor all frequencies. In the second part, we introduce an alternative model\nwhich is based on self-interactions described by an action principle. When the\ncoupling is constant, this model can be solved exactly and gives rise to a\npartially reflecting mirror. The usefulness of this dynamical model lies in the\npossibility of switching off the coupling between the mirror and the field.\nThis allows to obtain regularized expressions for the fluxes in situations\nwhere they are singular when using the DF model. Two examples are considered.\nThe first concerns the flux induced by the disappearance of the reflection\ncondition, a situation which bears some analogies with the end of the\nevaporation of a black hole. The second case concerns the flux emitted by a\nuniformly accelerated mirror.",

Attention is restricted to odd\nparity (``axial'') $w$-modes. With $R$ the radius of the star, $M$ its mass,\n$R_{i}$ the radius of the inner core and $M_{i}$ the mass of such core, it is\nshown that stars with $R/M\\geq 5$ can have several trapped $w$-modes, as long\nas $R_{i}/M_{i}<2.6$. Excitation of the least damped $w$-mode is confirmed for\na few models. All of these stars can only exist however, for values of the\nratio between the densities of the two phases, greater than $\\sim 46$. We also\nshow that stars with a phase transition and a given value of $R/M$ can have far\nmore trapped modes than a homogeneous single density star with the same value\nof $R/M$, provided both $R/M$ and $R_{i}/M_{i}$ are smaller than 3. If the\nphase transition is very fast, most of the stars with trapped modes are\nunstable to radial oscillations.

We also give for the first time an estimate\nof the metallicity of the two clusters which turns out to be close to solar.\nRadial velocity measurements together with Halpha chromospheric emission and\nthe presence/absence of other spectroscopic features are used to ascertain the\nmembership status for the sample stars not yet confirmed as cluster members;\nrotational velocities have also been determined for all sample stars. Stars\nmore massive than ~1 Mo in both clusters show no sign of significant Li\ndepletion, while lower mass stars are all lithium depleted, with the amount of\nLi depletion increasing to cooler temperatures. We confirm that the late G and\nearly K stars in IC 2602 present a star-to-star scatter in Li abundances\nsimilar to, but not as large as the one in the Pleiades. A scatter is also seen\namong late-K and M dwarfs. Unlike in the Pleiades and Alpha Per clusters, the\nscatter among early-K stars in IC 2602 shows only marginal correlation with\nrotation. Our data suggest that the drop-off of lithium towards lower masses\nmay start at an earlier color in IC 2391 than in IC 2602, but larger cluster\nsamples are needed to confirm this result. In addition, whereas G and early K\nstars in the two clusters are, on average, more Li rich than their counterparts\nin the Pleiades, a fraction of the coolest stars, in particular in IC 2391, are\nas depleted as as the lowest-Li Pleiades stars of the same mass.

These findings\nclearly exclude an SCDW driven mechanism at 220 K, but they cannot exclude the\noccurence of a displacive transition at higher temperature.

Such selection criteria provide a\nprofound advantage over the criteria used by most investigators in the past,\nsuch as ultraviolet excess. These tests were done using ground based high\nresolution VLA A-configuration 3.6 cm radio and optical B and I imaging data.\n  From the relative number of Seyfert 1's and Seyfert 2's we calculate that the\ntorus half opening angle is 48deg.

We find that there is no statistically significant difference in\nthe distribution of host galaxy morphological types and radio luminosities of\nSeyfert 1's and Seyfert 2's, suggesting that previous results showing the\nopposite may have been due to selection effects. The average extension of the\nradio emission of Seyfert 1's is smaller than that of Seyfert 2's by a factor\nof ~2-3, as predicted by the Unified Model. A search for galaxies around our\nSeyferts allows us to put a lower and an upper limit on the possible number of\ncompanions around these galaxies of 19% and 28%, respectively, with no\nsignificant difference in the number of companion galaxies between Seyfert 1's\nand Seyfert 2's. We also show that there is no preference for the radio jets to\nbe aligned closer to the host galaxy disk axis in late type Seyferts, unlike\nresults claimed by previous papers.

In particular,\nthe effective coupling of a radion to two gluons is enhanced due to the trace\nanomaly of QCD.

Type 1 and type 2 Seyferts produce\ncompact radio components which are indistinguishable in strength and aspect,\nindicating that their central engines are alike as proposed by the unification\nmodel. Infrared IRAS fluxes are more closely correlated with low-resolution\nradio fluxes than high-resolution radio fluxes, suggesting that they are\ndominated by kiloparsec-scale, extra-nuclear emission regions; extra-nuclear\nemission may be stronger in type 2 Seyferts. Early-type Seyfert galaxies tend\nto have stronger nuclear radio emission than late-type Seyfert galaxies.\nV-shaped extended emission-line regions, indicative of `ionisation cones', are\nusually found in sources with large, collimated radio outflows. Hidden broad\nlines are most likely to be found in sources with powerful nuclear radio\nsources. Type 1 and type 2 Seyferts selected by their IRAS 12-micron flux\ndensities have well matched properties.",

In our scheme, two EPR entangled photons are used\nas the probe and polarization sensitive measurements are performed at the four\nports of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer. In comparison with the previous\nsingle photon scheme, it is shown that the two photon approach has a higher\nprobability of initial state preserving interrogation of an atom prepared in a\nquantum superposition.

To investigate this hypothesis, we\nhave analyzed archival ASCA data for several known AXPs and SGRs, and fitted\nthem with a model in which all or part of the X-ray flux originates as thermal\nemission from a magnetar. Our magnetar spectral model includes the effects of\nthe anisotropy of the heat flow through an ultramagnetized neutron star\nenvelope, reprocessing by a light element atmosphere, and general relativistic\ncorrections to the observed spectrum. We obtain good fits to the data with\nradii for the emitting areas which are generally consistent with those expected\nfor neutron stars, in contrast to blackbody (BB) fits, which imply much smaller\nradii. Furthermore, the inclusion of atmospheric effects results in inferred\ntemperatures which are lower than those implied by BB fits, but however still\ntoo high to be accounted by thermal cooling alone. An extra source of heating\n(possibly due to magnetic field decay) is needed. Despite the harder tail in\nthe spectrum produced by reprocessing of the outgoing flux through the\natmosphere, spectral fits still require a considerable fraction of the flux to\nbe in a power-law component.",

    "summary": "As a result of spherical kinematics, temporal evolution of received gamma-ray\nemission should demonstrate signatures of curvature from the emitting shell.\nSpecifically, the shape of the pulse decay must bear a strict dependence on the\ndegree of curvature of the gamma-ray emitting surface. We compare the spectral\nevolution of the decay of individual GRB pulses to the evolution as expected\nfrom curvature. In particular, we examine the relationship between photon flux\nintensity (I) and the peak of the \\nu F\\nu distribution (E_{peak}) as predicted\nby colliding shells. Kinematics necessitate that E_{peak} demonstrate a\npower-law relationship with I described roughly as: I=E_{peak}^{(1-\\zeta)}\nwhere \\zeta represents a weighted average of the low and high energy spectral\nindices. Data analyses of 24 BATSE gamma-ray burst pulses provide evidence that\nthere exists a robust relationship between E_{peak} and I in the decay phase.\nSimulation results, however, show that a sizable fraction of observed pulses\nevolve faster than kinematics allow. Regardless of kinematic parameters, we\nfound that the existence of curvature demands that the I - E_{peak} function\ndecay be defined by \\sim (1-\\zeta). Efforts were employed to break this\ncurvature dependency within simulations through a number of scenarios such as\nanisotropic emission (jets) with angular dependencies, thickness values for the\ncolliding shells, and various cooling mechanisms. Of these, the only method\nsuccessful in dominating curvature effects was a slow cooling model. As a\nresult, GRB models must confront the fact that observed pulses do not evolve in\nthe manner which curvature demands.",

    "summary": "Modern formulations of equivalence principles provide the foundation for an\nefficient approach to understanding and organizing the structural features of\ngravitation field theories. Since theories' predictions reflect differences in\ntheir structures, principles of equivalence also support an efficient\nexperimental strategy for testing gravitation theories and for exploring the\nrange of conceivable gravitation physics. These principles focus attention\nsquarely on empirical consequences of the fundamental structural differences\nthat distinguish one gravitation theory from another. Interestingly, the\nvariety of such consequences makes it possible to design and perform\nexperiments that test equivalence principles stringently but do so in markedly\ndifferent ways than the most familiar experimental tests.",

    "summary": "We present high resolution H I 21 cm line, 20 cm radio continuum, and CO(1-0)\nline observations of the luminous infrared galaxy NGC 6670. NGC 6670 consists\nof two edge-on disk galaxies (NGC 6670E and NGC 6670W) with a projected nuclear\nseparation of ~16 kpc. While there are no optically identified tidal features\nand the molecular disks are not distorted much, we have detected a 90 kpc long\nH I tail which suggests that the galaxies are interacting and have already\nexperienced at least one close encounter. Our observations suggest that the\nprevious encounter between the galaxies had a large impact parameter and that\nthe system is still in an early stage of interaction.\n  Even though NGC 6670 is in an early stage of interaction, we find evidence of\nstarburst. The CO(1-0) observations show large molecular gas reservoirs in the\ncentral regions and the 20 cm radio continuum observations reveal enhanced star\nformation activity in the nuclear regions of both galaxies. We estimate the\nratio L_IR/M_H2, which is often used as an indicator of star formation\nefficiency, in the nuclear regions of NGC 6670E and NGC 6670W to be 18 and 11\nL_sun/M_sun, respectively. The nuclear star formation efficiency of these two\ngalaxies has been elevated to the level observed in other nearby starburst\ngalaxies (L_IR/M_H2 > 10 L_sun/M_sun). Other indicators of starburst activity\nsuch as CO brightness temperature and infrared surface brightness are also\nobserved.",

It is shown that at the latitude of Obninsk within a 24-hour\nobservation period the horizontal projection of aether wind velocity varies\nfrom 140 km/s to 480 km/s. The second version of this paper (arXiv:\n1003.2899v2, 15.04.2010) is supplemented with a second method of finding the\nvelocity of the aether wind -- through measuring the largest seasonal decrease\nin the ratio of the summer shift of the interference fringe to the winter one\n(equaled ~12%). It gave the same interval of values of the projections of the\naether wind velocity as the first method. More than hundred years there\npersists a belief that Michelson-type interferometer can not be adjusted such\nas to detect effects of the first order with respect to v/c. Below I show that\nit is possible, and more successfully than on the interferometer of the second\norder. In contrast to the traditional approach, in the interferometer of the\nfirst order the light after splitting on a semi-transparent plate propagates in\nboth arms to the reflecting mirrors in one optical medium, and returns after\nreflection from the mirrors through another optical medium. The shift of the\ninterference fringe was found to be proportional to the difference of\ndielectric permittivities of these media. The horizontal projection of the\nEarth's velocity relative to luminiferous aether measured by the first order\ninterferometer agrees with that found by the first two methods.",

Very approximately, the gas presents as a circular ring with\nazimuthal variations in the CO brightness by about a factor of 2. Until about\n1600 years ago, the star was a red hypergiant losing about 0.0003 M(Sun)/yr at\nan average outflow speed of 32 km/s. We propose that when HD 179821 explodes as\na supernova, it may resemble Kepler's supernova remnant and thus some of the\nanisotropies in supernova remnants may be intrinsic. If the factors which cause\nthe anisotropic mass loss in HD 179821 persist to the moment when the star\nexplodes as a supernova, the newly-born pulsar may receive a momentum \"kick\"\nleading to a space motion near 700 km/s. Independent of the angular\nasymmetries, the radially detached shell around HD 179821 may be representative\nof environments which produce dust echoes from gamma-ray bursts.",

However, Lambda world models had earlier been proposed by Hoell &\nPriester and Liebscher et al. on the basis of quasar absorption-line data.\nEmploying more general repulsive fluids (\"dark energy\") encompassing the Lambda\ncomponent we quantitatively compare both approaches with each other.\n  Fitting the SN-data by a minimum-component model consisting of dark energy +\ndust yields a closed universe with a large amount of dust exceeding the\nbaryonic content constrained by big-bang nucleosynthesis. The nature of the\ndark energy is hardly constrained. Only when enforcing a flat universe there is\na clear tendency to a dark-energy Lambda fluid and the `canonical' value\nOmega_M = 0.3 for dust.\n  Conversely, fitting the quasar-data by a minimum-component model yields a\nsharply defined, slightly closed model with a low dust density ruling out\nsignificant pressureless dark matter. The dark-energy component obtains an\nequation-of-state P = -0.96 epsilon close to that of a Lambda-fluid. Omega_M =\n0.3 or a precisely flat spatial geometry are inconsistent with\nminimum-component models.\n  It is found that quasar and supernova data sets cannot be reconciled with\neach other via (repulsive ideal fluid+dust+radiation)-world models.\nCompatibility could be reached by drastic expansion of the parameter space with\nat least two exotic fluids added to dust and radiation as world constituents.\nIf considering such solutions as far-fetched one has to conclude that the\nquasar absorption line and the SN-Ia constraints are incompatible.",

We have undertaken high resolution CO(J=1-0)\nobservations for the ultraluminous infrared galaxies that have nuclear\nseparations larger than 20 kpc. We have detected the CO emission in 5 out of 6\nsystems, but only in one component of the ULIRG pairs. 4 of them have LINER\nspectral type and 1 galaxy has Seyfert II spectral type. In K'-band images\nthese components are also brighter than the other components which have either\nHII-region spectra or no detectable emission lines. Using the standard\nconversion factor, the molecular gas content is estimated to be a few times 10\n$^{10}$ M$_\\odot$, similar to that of the other ultraluminous galaxies. The\nresult indicates that the galaxy containing the molecular gas is also the\nsource of most, if not all, of the huge far-infrared luminosity of the system.\nThe optical and K'-band imaging observations and optical spectra suggest\nmultiple merger scenario for 1 system. If the remaining systems are in an early\nstage of a binary tidal interaction, the commonly accepted interpretation of\nthe ULIRG phenomenon as the final merger stage of two disk galaxies may need to\nbe re-examined.",

The experimental results on the relation between the number of\nevents, the angular distributions of protons and full number of protons are\npresented for 12CC-interactions at the momentum of 4.2 A GeV/c. The influence\nof nuclear fragmentation process on the results is also considered. The\nobtained results confirm the assumption that there exist the critical phenomena\namong the central collisions and it is necessary to use a percolation approach\nfor the full description of the central collisions.",

In order to assess the\nreliability of this method, we apply it to simulated far-infrared polarization\nmaps derived from three-dimensional simulations of supersonic\nmagnetohydrodynamical turbulence, and compare the estimated values to the known\nmagnetic field strengths in the simulations. We investigate the effects of\nlimited telescope resolution and self-gravity on the structure of the maps.\nLimited observational resolution affects the field structure such that small\nscale variations can be completely suppressed, thus giving the impression of a\nvery homogeneous field. The Chandrasekhar-Fermi method of estimating the mean\nmagnetic field in a turbulent medium is tested, and we suggest an extension to\nmeasure the rms field. Both methods yield results within a factor of 2 for\nfield strengths typical of molecular clouds, with the modified version\nreturning more reliable estimates for slightly weaker fields. However, neither\nmethod alone works well for very weak fields, missing them by a factor of up to\n150. Taking the geometric mean of both methods estimates even the weakest\nfields accurately within a factor of 2.5. Limited telescope resolution leads to\na systematic overestimation of the field strengths for all methods. We discuss\nthe effects responsible for this overestimation and show how to extract\ninformation on the underlying (turbulent) power spectrum.",

We\nderive a Bell-type inequality pertaining to the teleportation scenario and show\nthat it is violated in the case of teleportation using a perfect singlet. We\nalso investigate teleportation using `Werner states' of the form x P + (1-x)\nI/4, where P is the projector corresponding to a singlet state and I is the\nidentity. We find that our inequality is violated, implying nonlocality, if x >\n1/sqrt(2). In addition, we extend Werner's local hidden variable model to\nsimulation of teleportation with the x = 1/2 Werner state. Thus teleportation\nusing this state does not involve nonlocality even though the fidelity achieved\nis 3/4 which is greater than the `classical limit' of 2/3. Finally, we comment\non a result of Gisin's and offer some philosophical remarks on teleportation\nand nonlocality generally.",

As a byproduct of the proof of the \"if\" part,\nwe obtain that every compact subset of an acyclic open set in a compact\norientable 3-manifold M is contained in a PL homology 3-ball in M.\n  We show that k-quasi-isotopy implies (k+1)-cobordism of Cochran and Orr.

The\nX-ray image shows the nucleus, southern extranuclear cloud, and northern loop,\nthe morphology of the extended emission being very similar to those seen in\nradio continuum and optical emission line images. The X-ray spectrum of the\nnucleus is well represented by a model consisting of soft thermal plasma with\nkT ~0.5 keV, a very hard continuum, and an Fe Kalpha emission line at 6.45 keV\nwith an equivalent width of >2 keV. The very strong Fe line and the flat\ncontinuum indicate that the nucleus is obscured by a column density in excess\nof 10^24 cm^-2 and the spectrum is dominated by reflected emission from cold\nmatter near the nucleus. The X-ray spectra of the extranuclear clouds are well\nfitted by a thermal plasma model with kT ~0.5 keV. This spectral shape and\nmorphology strongly suggest that the clouds are shock heated by the bi-polar\noutflow from the nucleus. The shock velocities of the extranuclear cloud and\nnorthern loop inferred from the temperatures of the X-ray gas are 690 km/s and\n660 km/s, respectively. By assuming a steady-state situation in which the\nemission of the extranuclear clouds is powered by the jets, the mechanical\nenergy in the jets is found to be comparable to the bolometric luminosity of\nthe nucleus.",

Infrared interferometers are a highly sensitive astronomical\ninstruments that enable us to observe terrestrial planets around nearby stars.\nIn this context the Infrared Space Interferometry Mission (IRSI)/ DARWIN is\nstudied. The current design calls for a constellation of 6 free flying\ntelescopes using 1.5m mirrors, plus one hub and one master spacecraft. As the\nbaseline trajectory an orbit about the second collinear libration point of the\nEarth-Sun system has been selected. The thermal radiation from the\ninterplanetary dust cloud that surrounds the Sun, the so-called zodiacal\ninfrared foreground, is a major concern for any high-sensitivity infrared\nmission. The most reliable information about this radiation comes from the\nmeasurements by NASA's Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) mission. There are\nvarious ways to detect faint terrestrial planets despite the bright foreground.\nWe find that, using integration times in the order of 30h, the baseline mission\nscenario is capable of detecting earth-sized exo-planets out to 14pc. We seize\nthe suggestion that increasing the heliocentric distance of the instrument\nwould make the observing conditions even better. A dust model that was fitted\nto the COBE measurements shows that an observing location of DARWIN in the\nouter solar system would potentially reduce the zodiacal foreground by a factor\nof 100, effectively increasing the number of potential target stars by almost a\nfactor of 30.",

The resulting energy-dependent profiles are characterized by a\ndipole-resonant peak and higher energy fine structure. The polarization\ndependence is predominantly $\\sigma$-to-$\\pi$ and the azimuthal dependence\nfollows a sin-squared behavior. These results are similar to those obtained in\nrecent x-ray scattering studies of orbital ordering carried out in these same\nmaterials at the Mn K edge. They lead to a description of the cross-section in\nterms of Templeton scattering in which the tilt ordering breaks the symmetry at\nthe rare earth site. The most interesting result of the present work is our\nobservation that octahedral tilt ordering persists above the orbital ordering\ntransition temperatures in all three samples. Indeed, we identify separate\nstructural transitions which may be associated with the onset of orbital and\ntilt ordering, respectively, and characterize the loss of tilt ordering versus\ntemperature in LaMnO$_3$.",

    "summary": "Recently, it has been shown that cosmic neutrino flux at the GRB/AGN source,\n$F_{\\nu_e}^0 : F_{\\nu_{\\mu}}^0 : F_{\\nu_{\\tau}}^0 \\simeq 1 :2 :0 $, inevitably\noscillates (in the three neutrino framework) to 1 : 1: 1, irrespective of the\nmixing angle relevant to the solar data. It has also been pointed out that the\nintrinsic flux of the cosmic high-energy neutrinos may not have the standard\nratio, in which case the cosmic neutrino flux in the far distance should be\ndependent of the mixing angle. For neutrinos with nonzero electromagnetic\nproperties, we show in the latter case that matter effects on oscillations of\nhigh-energy cosmic neutrinos can substantially modify the vacuum oscillation\nprobability, if the mass-squared difference is $\\lsim 10^{-10}$ eV^2.",

Four\nsources were found to be quasars with z>4, of which one was previously known.\nThis sample bridges the gap between the strong radio surveys with S_5GHz>200\nmJy and the samples of radio-weak quasars that can be generated via radio\nobservations of optically selected quasars.\n  In addition, 4 new quasars at z>3 have been found. The selection criteria\nresult in a success-rate of ~1:7 for radio-loud quasars at z>4, which is a\nsignificant improvement over previous studies. This search yields a surface\ndensity of 1 per 1600 deg^2, which is about a factor of ~15 lower than that\nfound in a similar search for radio-quiet quasars at z>4. The study presented\nhere is strongly biased against quasars beyond z>4.5, since the e-passband of\nthe POSS-I only samples the spectra shortward of 1200 Angstrom at these\nredshifts.",

The L_X:L_B and\nL_X:L_{FIR} relations of spiral galaxies in groups appear to be\nindistinguishable from those in other environments, however the elliptical\ngalaxies fall into two distinct classes. The first class is central-dominant\ngroup galaxies which are very X-ray luminous, and may be the focus of group\ncooling flows. All other early-type galaxies in groups belong to the second\nclass, which populates an almost constant band of L_X/L_B over the range 9.8 <\nlog L_B < 11.3. The X-ray emission from these galaxies can be explained by a\nsuperposition of discrete galactic X-ray sources together with a contribution\nfrom hot gas lost by stars, which varies a great deal from galaxy to galaxy. In\nthe region where the optical luminosity of the non-central group galaxies\noverlaps with the dominant galaxies, the dominant galaxies are over an order of\nmagnitude more luminous in X-rays.\n  We also compared these group galaxies with a sample of isolated early-type\ngalaxies, and used previously published work to derive L_X:L_B relations as a\nfunction of environment. The non-dominant group galaxies have mean L_X/L_B\nratios very similar to that of isolated galaxies, and we see no significant\ncorrelation between L_X/L_B and environment.

    "summary": "A study is made of a sample of 58 dust-enshrouded Asymptotic Giant Branch\n(AGB) stars (including 2 possible post AGB stars), of which 27 are carbon-rich\nand 31 are oxygen-rich. These objects were originally identified by Jura &\nKleinmann as nearby (within about 1 kpc of the sun) AGB stars with high\nmass-loss rates, greater than 1E-6 solar masses per year. Ground-based\nnear-infrared photometry, data obtained by IRAS and kinematic data from the\nliterature are combined to investigate the properties of these stars. The light\namplitude in the near-infrared is found to be correlated with period, and this\namplitude decreases with increasing wavelength. Statistical tests show that\nthere is no reason to suspect any difference in the period distributions of the\ncarbon- and oxygen-rich stars for periods less than 1000 days, and no\ncarbon-rich star has a period longer than 1000 days. The colours are consistent\nwith those of cool stars with evolved circumstellar dust-shells. Luminosities\nand distances are estimated using a period-luminosity relation. Mass-loss\nrates, estimated from the 60 micron fluxes, show a correlation with pulsation\nperiod and is tightly correlated with the K-[12] colour. The kinematics and\nscale-height of the sample shows that the sources with periods less than 1000\ndays must have low mass main-sequence progenitors. It is argued that the three\noxygen-rich stars with periods over 1000 days probably had intermediate mass\nmain-sequence progenitors with remaining stars having an average progenitor\nmass of about 1.3 solar masses. The average lifetime of stars in this phase is\nestimated to be about 4.0E4 years, indicating they will undergo at most one\nmore thermal pulse before leaving the AGB.",

We show that an elastic description of the pinned Wigner crystal\nprovides an excellent framework to obtain most of the physically relevant\nobservables. Using such a description, we compute the static and dynamical\nproperties. We find that, akin to the Bragg glass phase, a good degree of\ntranslational order survives (up to a large lengthscale in $d=2$, infinite in\n$d=3$). Using a gaussian variational method, we obtain the full frequency\ndependence of the conductivity tensor. The zero temperature Hall resistivity is\nindependent of frequency and remains unaffected by disorder at its classical\nvalue. We show that the characteristic features of the conductivity in the\npinned Wigner crystal are dramatically different from those arising from the\nnaive extrapolations of Fukuyama-Lee type theories for charge density waves. We\ndetermine the relevant scales and find that the physical properties depend\ncrucially on whether the disorder correlation length is larger than the\ncyclotron length or not. We analyse, in particular, the magnetic field and\ndensity dependence of the optical conductivity. Within our approach the pinning\nfrequency can increase with increasing magnetic field and varies as $n^{-3/2}$\nwith the density $n$.

    "summary": "Superfluid phenomena can be explained in terms of the topologies of the order\nparameter and of the confining vessel. For example, currents in a toroidal\nvessel can be characterized by a discrete and conserved quantity, the winding\nnumber. In trapped Bose-Einstein condensates, the topology of the trap can be\ncharacterized by the topology of the Thomas-Fermi surface of its N-particle\nground state. This can be altered during an experiment, so that a toroidal trap\nmay deform into a more spherical shape, allowing an initially persistent\ncurrent to decay into singly-quantized vortices. We investigate such a\nprocedure numerically, and confirm that the Thomas-Fermi prescription for the\ntrap topology gives an accurate picture of vortex formation.",

    "summary": "The GRB010222 optical and near-infrared (NIR) afterglow was monitored at the\nTNG and other Italian telescopes starting ~1 day after the high-energy prompt\nevent. The optical BVR light curves, which are the best sampled, are\ncontinuously steepening, and can be described by two power laws, f(t) =\nt^(-alpha), of indices alpha_1 ~ 0.7 and alpha_2 ~ 1.3 before and after a break\noccurring at about 0.5 days after the GRB start time, respectively. This model\naccounts well also for the flux in the U, I and J bands, which are less well\nmonitored. The temporal break appears to be achromatic. The two K-band points\nare not consistent with the above behaviour, and rather suggest a constant\ntrend. A low-resolution optical spectrum has also been taken with TNG. In the\noptical spectrum we found three absorption systems at different redshifts\n(0.927, 1.155 and 1.475), the highest of which represents a lower limit to, and\nprobably coincides with, the redshift of this GRB. The broad-band optical\nspectral energy distributions do not appear to vary with time, consistently\nwith the achromatic behaviour of the light curves. We compare our measurements\nwith different afterglow evolution scenarios and we find that they favor a\ntransition from relativistic to non-relativistic conditions in the shock\npropagation.",

    "summary": "Far-infrared spectra of laboratory silicates are normally obtained at room\ntemperature even though the grains responsible for astronomical silicate\nemission bands seen at wavelengths >20 micron are likely to be at temperatures\nbelow ~150 K. In order to investigate the effect of temperature on silicate\nspectra, we have obtained absorption spectra of powdered forsterite and\nolivine, along with two orthoenstatites and diopside clinopyroxene, at 3.5+-0.5\nK and at room temperature (295+-2K). To determine the changes in the spectra\nthe resolution must be increased from 1 to 0.25 cm^-1 at both temperatures\nsince a reduction in temperature reduces the phonon density, thereby reducing\nthe width of the infrared peaks. Several bands observed at 295 K split at 3.5\nK. At 3.5 K the widths of isolated single bands in olivine, enstatites and\ndiopside are ~ 90% of their 295 K-widths. However, in forsterite the\n3.5-K-widths of the 31-, 49- and 69-micron bands are, respectively, 90%, 45%\nand 31% of their 295 K widths. Due to an increase in phonon energy as the\nlattice contracts, 3.5-K-singlet peaks occur at shorter wavelengths than do the\ncorresponding 295-K peaks; the magnitude of the wavelength shift increases from\n\\~ 0-0.2 micron at 25 micron to ~0.9 micron at 80 micron. Changes in the\nrelative absorbances of spectral peaks are also observed. The temperature\ndependence of lambda_pk and bandwidth shows promise as a means to deduce\ncharacteristic temperatures of mineralogically distinct grain populations. In\naddition, the observed changes in band strength with temperature will affect\nestimates of grain masses and relative mineral abundances inferred using\nroom-temperature laboratory data.",

The latter have been characterized by simple systems of axioms\nwith a combinatorial-geometric flavour. Similar to buildings geometries can be\nassociated with finite sporadic simple groups (FSSGs). However, most of the\nknown characterizations of such geometries for FSSGs require additional\nassumptions of a group-theoretic nature. One aim of this thesis is to present\ncharacterizations of geometries for FSSGs J_2, Suz, McL, Co_3, Fi(22), Fi(23),\nFi(24) and He, which are in the same spirit as the characterizations of\nbuildings and polar spaces mentioned above, in particular without any\nassumption on the automorphism groups of the geometries. A by-product of these\nresults for J_2, Suz and He is a proof that certain presentations for those\ngroups are faithful. Most of this work may be viewed as a contribution to the\ntheory of graphs with prescribed neighbourhood. The result on graphs of\n(+)-points of GF(3)-orthogonal spaces, which is also used for characterization\nof geometries for Fi(22), Fi(23) and Fi(24), may be considered as a\ngeneralization of a well-known theorem on locally co-triangular graphs.\nHyperovals of polar spaces are natural generalizations of hyperovals of\nprojective planes of even order and play an important role in investigations of\nextensions of polar spaces. As a by-product new extended generalized\nquadrangles were found as hyperovals of the polar spaces Q_5^+(4) and H_5(4).",

We show that a standard\naccretion disc cannot account for the observed optical luminosity, unless it\nradiates at super-Eddington rates. This implies the existence of another,\ndominant emission mechanism in the optical range, or a non standard disc (non\nstationary, ADAF and/or strong outflows). Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxies\n(NLS1s) are most extreme in this context: they have larger bolometric to\nEddington luminosity ratios than Broad Line Seyfert 1 (BLS1s), and most likely\na larger \"non disc\" component in the optical range. From realistic simulations\nof self-gravitating $\\alpha$-discs, we have systematically localized the\ngravitationally unstable disc and shown that, given uncertainties on both the\nmodel and observations, it coincides quite well with the size of the BLR. We\ntherefore suggest that the gravitationally unstable disc is the source which\nreleases BLR clouds in the medium. However the influence of the ionization\nparameter is also required to explain the correlation found between the size of\nthe BLR and the luminosity. In this picture the size of the BLR in NLS1s\n(relative to the black hole size) is larger (and the emission line width\nsmaller) than in BLS1s simply because their Eddington ratio is larger.",

The objects divide into two\nclasses. In the first class, exemplified by Cyg X-1, luminosity and spectral\nhardness evolve simultaneously. In the second class, the relation is more\ncomplicated: the softest spectra occur while the count rate is dropping. Most\nmodels of accretion, tailored to Cyg X-1, do not predict the second sort of\nbehavior. One interpretation is a simple model with two simultaneous,\nindependent accretion flows: a thin disk and a hot halo. A drop in the\naccretion rate affecting both flows would propagate through the halo\nimmediately but might take up to several weeks to propagate through the disk.\nWhile the inner halo is thus temporarily depleted compared to the disk, a\ntemporary soft state is expected. This picture is supported by the observation\nthat those sources which show delays (1E 1740.7-2942, GRS 1758-258, and GX\n339-4) are expected to have low-mass companions, and those which do not (Cyg\nX-1, Cyg X-3) are known or thought to have high-mass companions. Low-mass\ncompanions imply accretion by Roche-lobe overflow, with a high specific angular\nmomentum in the accreting material, and therefore a large disk with a long\nviscous timescale. Wind accretion from massive companions is expected to result\nin a much smaller disk, and thus little viscous delay.",

It is shown that this vacuum degeneracy is\nsmoothed out, once quantum corrections are taken into account. In N_f=1 case,\nthe effective potential is found to be so-called runaway type, and there is\nneither well-defined vacuum nor local minimum. On the other hand, in N_f=2\ncase, while there is also the runaway direction in the effective potential, we\nfind the possibility that there appears the local minimum with broken\nsupersymmetry at the degenerate dyon point.",

This phenomenon culminating in the anisotropic pulsation of the particle\nis associated with the notion of spin. The particle-space interaction is\ntreated as the origin of the matter waves, which are identified with the\nparticle inertia and inertons surrounding the moving particle are considered as\ncarriers of its inert properties. Inertons are also identified with real\ncarriers of the gravitational interaction and the range of the particle\ngravitational potential is evaluated by the inerton cloud amplitude\n$\\Lambda=\\lambda c/v$, where $\\lambda$ is the de Broglie wavelength, $c$ and\n$v$ are the velocity of light and the particle respectively.

Comparison is made with\nobservations from OGLE and EROS in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds.

The wings of\nthe H-alpha emission are found to be displaced from the star towards the\nsouth-west (blue wing) and north-east (red wing) with angular scales of 20-30\nmilli-arcsecs. This structure is consistent with a bipolar outflow from the\nstar. From a study of the variability of the intensity and position spectra we\nargue that a combination of magnetically-driven bipolar outflow and accreting\ngas contribute to the H-alpha emission. On the other hand, the [OI] and [SII]\nemission are displaced from the star to the south-west but at much larger\ndistances than the H-alpha, hundreds of milli-arcsecs for the high-velocity\ncomponent (HVC) and down to 30 milli-arcsecs for the low-velocity components\n(LVC). The presence of both red-shifted and blue-shifted outflows in H-alpha\nbut only a blue-shifted outflow in the forbidden lines can be explained if the\ndisc obscures the red-shifted forbidden line outflow, but a disc gap with outer\nradius 3-4 au allows the red-shifted H-alpha to be seen.

    "summary": "We analyse the cosmology of a brane world model where a single brane carrying\nthe standard model fields forms the boundary of a 5-dimensional AdS bulk (the\nRandall-Sundrum II scenario). We focus on the thermal radiation of bulk\ngravitons, the formation of the bulk black hole, and the holographic AdS/CFT\ndefinition of the RSII theory. Our detailed calculation of bulk radiation\nreduces previous estimates to a phenomenologically acceptable, although\npotentially visible level. In late cosmology, in which the Friedmann equation\ndepends linearly on the energy density \\rho, only about 0.5% of energy density\nis lost to the black hole or, equivalently, to the `dark radiation'\n(\\Omega_{d,N} \\simeq 0.005 at nucleosynthesis). The preceding, unconventional\n\\rho^2 period can produce up to 5% dark radiation (\\Omega_{d,N} <\\sim 0.05).\nThe AdS/CFT correspondence provides an equivalent description of late RSII\ncosmology. We show how the AdS/CFT formulation can reproduce the \\rho^2\ncorrection to the standard treatment at low matter density. However, the\n4-dimensional effective theory of CFT + gravity breaks down due to higher\ncurvature terms for energy densities where \\rho^2 behaviour in the Friedmann\nequation is usually predicted. We emphasize that, in going beyond this energy\ndensity, the microscopic formulation of the theory becomes essential. For\nexample, the pure AdS_5 and string-motivated AdS_5\\timesS^5 definitions differ\nin their cosmological implications.",

The\ntemperature dependence of the relaxation times is well described by a power-law\nwith a q-dependent exponent in an intermediate temperature range. The\ntime-temperature superposition principle of MCT is clearly bourne out in the\nwhole range of wave numbers. An analysis of the alpha-decay using\nKohlrausch-Williams-Watts (KWW) functions reveals that the collective melt\nKWW-stretching exponent and KWW-relaxation times are modulated with the\nstructure factor.

For reasonable assumptions - supported by\nthe few sparse available observational constraints - about the unknown mass and\nthickness of the hydrogen layer for the cluster white dwarfs, a realistic\nestimate of the systematic error on the distance is within +-0.10 mag.

The coefficient of this anomaly is\nreproduced by a free field calculation indicating a non-renormalisation theorem\ninherited from the ${\\cal N} =4$ theory.

At\nthe level of CP-invariance, the suggestion of dual neutrino properties defines\nthe symmetric two-mixing-angle form of the widely discussed four-neutrino\n$(2+2)$-mixing scheme, as a result of the lepton charge conservation selection\nrule and a minimum of two Dirac neutrino fields. With neutrino duality, the\ntwo-doublet structure of the Majorana neutrino mass spectrum is a vestige of\nthe two-Dirac-neutrino origin. The fine neutrino mass doublet structure is\nnatural because it is produced by a lepton charge symmetry violating\nperturbation on a zero-approximation system of two twofold mass-degenerate\nDirac neutrino-antineutrino pairs.

For $\\eta >0$ we find the connectivity distribution\nis power law with exponent $\\gamma=<\\eta>+2$.

This model also has a power law connectivity distribution,\nbut with an exponent which depends on the multiplicative fitness at each node.\nIn the third model (C), a directed graph is considered and is built by the\naddition of nodes and the creation of links.

    "summary": "Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are emitted by relativistic ejecta from powerful\ncosmic explosions. Their light curves suggest that the gamma-ray emission\noccurs at early stages of the ejecta expansion, well before it decelerates in\nthe ambient medium. If so, the launched gamma-ray front must overtake the\nejecta and sweep the ambient medium outward. As a result a gap is opened\nbetween the ejecta and the medium that surfs the radiation front ahead.\nEffectively, the ejecta moves in a cavity until it reaches a radius\nR_{gap}=10^{16}E_{54}^{1/2} cm where E is the isotropic energy of the GRB. At\nR=R_{gap} the gap is closed, a blast wave forms and collects the medium swept\nby radiation. Further development of the blast wave is strongly affected by the\nleading radiation front: the front plays the role of a precursor where the\nmedium is loaded with e+- pairs and preaccelerated just ahead of the blast. It\nimpacts the emission from the blast at R < R_{load}=5R_{gap} (the early\nafterglow). A spectacular observational effect results: GRB afterglows should\nstart in optical/UV and evolve fast (< min) to a normal X-ray afterglow. The\nearly optical emission observed in GRB 990123 may be explained in this way. The\nimpact of the front is especially strong if the ambient medium is a wind from a\nmassive progenitor of the GRB. In this case three phenomena are predicted: (1)\nThe ejecta decelerates at R<R_{load} producing a lot of soft radiation. (2) The\nlight curve of soft emission peaks at\nt_{peak}=40(1+z)E_{54}^{1/2}(Gamma_{ej}/100)^{-2} s where Gamma_{ej} is the\nLorentz factor of the ejecta. Given measured redshift z and t_{peak}, one finds\nGamma_{ej}. (3) The GRB acquires a spectral break at 5 - 50 MeV because harder\nphotons are absorbed by radiation scattered in the wind.",

For the 2D case the spin wave results predict a smooth\ndimensional crossover from 1D to 2D keeping the ground state always ordered.\nFor the ladder system, the DMRG results show that any $J_{\\perp}>0$ drives the\nsystem to a gapped ground state. Furthermore the behaviour of the correlation\nfunctions closely resemble the uniform spin-1/2 ladder. For $J_{\\perp}$ lower\nthan 0.3, however, the gap behaves quadratically as $\\Delta\\sim0.6\nJ^2_{\\perp}$.

A vital prerequisite, strongly linked\ncurrent flow, has already been demonstrated even at this early stage. One\npossible drawback is the observation that the field at which superconductivity\nis destroyed is modest. Further, the field which limits the range of practical\napplications, the irreversibility field H*(T), is ~7 T at liquid helium\ntemperature (4.2 K), significantly lower than ~10 T for Nb-Ti and ~20 T for\nNb_3Sn. Here we show that MgB_2 thin films can exhibit a much steeper\ntemperature dependence of H*(T) than is observed in bulk materials, yielding\nH*(4.2 K) above 14 T. In addition, very high critical current densities at 4.2\nK, 1 MA/cm_2 at 1 T and 10_5 A/cm_2 at 10 T, are possible.

    "summary": "In order to have well defined rules for the perturbative calculation of\nquantities of interest in an interacting quantum field theory in curved\nspacetime, it is necessary to construct Wick polynomials and their time ordered\nproducts for the noninteracting theory. A construction of these quantities has\nrecently been given by Brunetti, Fredenhagen, and Kohler, and by Brunetti and\nFredenhagen, but they did not impose any ``locality'' or ``covariance''\ncondition in their constructions. As a consequence, their construction of time\nordered products contained ambiguities involving arbitrary functions of\nspacetime point rather than arbitrary parameters. In this paper, we construct\nan ``extended Wick polynomial algebra''-large enough to contain the Wick\npolynomials and their time ordered products. We then define the notion of a\n{\\it local, covariant quantum field}, and seek a definition of {\\it local} Wick\npolynomials and their time ordered products as local, covariant quantum fields.\nWe impose scaling requirements on our local Wick polynomials and their time\nordered products as well as certain additional requirements-such as commutation\nrelations with the free field and appropriate continuity properties under\nvariations of the spacetime metric. For a given polynomial order in powers of\nthe field, we prove that these conditions uniquely determine the local Wick\npolynomials and their time ordered products up to a finite number of\nparameters. (These parameters correspond to the usual renormalization\nambiguities occurring in Minkowski spacetime together with additional\nparameters corresponding to the coupling of the field to curvature.) We also\nprove existence of local Wick polynomials. However, the issue of existence of\nlocal time ordered products is deferred to a future investigation",

Two\nprincipal conclusions were reached: (1) In the limit of a nearly `unsoftened'\ntwo-body kernel, the value of the largest Lyapunov exponent does NOT appear to\ndecrease systematically with increasing N. (2) Nevertheless, there is a clear\nquantifiable sense in which, on the average, as N increases chaotic orbits in\nthe frozen-N systems come to more closely approximate characteristics in the\nsmooth potential. When viewed in configuration or velocity space, or as probed\nby collisionless invariants like angular momentum, frozen-N orbits typically\ndiverge from smooth potential characteristics as a power law in time on a time\nscale proportional to N^(1/2)t_D, with t_D a characteristic dynamical, or\ncrossing, time.",

We present a\ngeneral method (DGE) to calculate a large class of logarithmically enhanced\nterms, using the dispersive approach in renormalon calculus. Dressed Gluon\nExponentiation is based on the fact that the exponentiation kernel is\nassociated primarily with a single gluon emission, and therefore the exponent\nis naturally represented as an integral over the running coupling. Fixing the\ndefinition of Lambda is enough to guarantee consistency with the exact exponent\nto next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. Renormalization scale dependence is\navoided by keeping all the logs. Sub-leading logs, that are usually neglected,\nare factorially enhanced and are therefore important. Renormalization-group\ninvariance as well as infrared renormalon divergence are recovered in the sum\nof all the logs. The logarithmically enhanced cross-section is evaluated by\nBorel summation. Renormalon ambiguity is then used to study power corrections\nin the peak region Qt \\gsim Lambda, where the hierarchy between the renormalon\nclosest to the origin (~1/Qt) and others (~1/(Qt)^n) starts to break down. The\nexponentiated power-corrections can be described by a shape-function, as\nadvocated by Korchemsky and Sterman. Our calculation suggests that the even\ncentral moments of the shape-function are suppressed. Good fits are obtained\nyielding alpha_s^{MSbar} (M_Z) = 0.110 \\pm 0.001, with a theoretical\nuncertainty of ~5%.",

One manifold, which we denote by A_8, is\ntopologically R^8 and another, which we denote by B_8, is the bundle of chiral\nspinors over $S^4$. Unlike the previously-known complete non-compact metric of\nSpin(7) holonomy, which was also defined on the bundle of chiral spinors over\nS^4, our new metrics are asymptotically locally conical (ALC): near infinity\nthey approach a circle bundle with fibres of constant length over a cone whose\nbase is the squashed Einstein metric on CP^3. We construct the\ncovariantly-constant spinor and calibrating 4-form. We also obtain an\nL^2-normalisable harmonic 4-form for the A_8 manifold, and two such 4-forms (of\nopposite dualities) for the B_8 manifold. We use the metrics to construct new\nsupersymmetric brane solutions in M-theory and string theory. In particular, we\nconstruct resolved fractional M2-branes involving the use of the L^2 harmonic\n4-forms, and show that for each manifold there is a supersymmetric example. An\nintriguing feature of the new A_8 and B_8 Spin(7) metrics is that they are\nactually the same local solution, with the two different complete manifolds\ncorresponding to taking the radial coordinate to be either positive or\nnegative. We make a comparison with the Taub-NUT and Taub-BOLT metrics, which\nby contrast do not have special holonomy. In an appendix we construct the\ngeneral solution of our first-order equations for Spin(7) holonomy, and obtain\nfurther regular metrics that are complete on manifolds B^+_8 and B^-_8 similar\nto B_8.",

    "summary": "The rotating disk problem is analyzed on the premise that proper\ninterpretation of experimental evidence leads to the conclusion that the\npostulates upon which relativity theory is based, particularly the invariance\nof the speed of light, are not applicable to rotating frames. Different\npostulates based on the Sagnac experiment are proposed, and from these\npostulates a new relativistic theory of rotating frames is developed following\nsteps similar to those initially followed by Einstein for rectilinear motion.\nThe resulting theory agrees with all experiments, resolves problems with the\ntraditional approach to the rotating disk, and exhibits both traditionally\nrelativistic and non-relativistic characteristics. Of particular note, no\nLorentz contraction exists on the rotating disk circumference, and the disk\nsurface, contrary to the assertions of Einstein and others, is found to be\nRiemann flat. The variable speed of light found in the Sagnac experiment is\nthen shown to be characteristic of non-time-orthogonal reference frames, of\nwhich the rotating frame is one. In addition, the widely accepted postulate for\nthe equivalence of inertial and non-inertial standard rods with zero relative\nvelocity, used liberally in prior rotating disk analyses, is shown to be\ninvalid for such frames. Further, the new theory stands alone in correctly\npredicting what was heretofore considered a \"spurious\" non-null effect on the\norder of 10^-13 found by Brillet and Hall in the most accurate Michelson-Morley\ntype test to date.

But how steep is the_galaxy_ mass function? We have analyzed\nthe stellar and gas mass functions of the first massive luminous objects formed\nin a \\Lambda CDM universe, as calculated in the numerical simulation described\nin Gnedin (2000ab). We found that while the dark matter mass function is steep,\nthe stellar and gas mass functions are flatter for low mass objects. The\nstellar mass function is consistently flat at the low mass end. Moreover, while\nthe gas mass function follows the dark matter mass function until reionization\nat z~7, between z=7 and z=4, the gas mass function also flattens considerably\nat the low mass end. At z=4, the gas and stellar mass functions are fit by a\nSchechter function with \\alpha ~ -1.2 +/- 0.1, significantly shallower than the\ndark matter halo mass function and consistent with some recent observations.\nThe baryonic mass functions are shallower because (a) the dark matter halo mass\nfunction is consistent with the Press-Schechter formulation at low masses n(M)\n  M^-2 and (b) heating/cooling and ionization processes appear to cause baryons\nto collect in halos with the relationship M_b M_d^4 at low masses. Combining\n(a) and (b) gives n(M_b) M_b^-5/4, comparable to the simulation results. Thus,\nthe well known observational fact that low mass galaxies are underabundant as\ncompared to expectations from numerical dark matter simulations or\nPress-Schechter modeling of CDM universes emerges naturally from these results,\nimplying that perhaps no ``new physics'' beyond the standard model is needed.",

We find that the equality between the\nincommensurability and the hole concentration is reproduced at low frequencies\nin the underdoped regime. This equality observed in experiments was explained\n{\\it only} based on the stripe model before. We also obtain the downward\ndispersion for the spin response and predict its doping dependence for further\nexperimental testing, as well as a proportionality between the low-energy\nincommensurability and the resonance energy.

If the accretion disk is larger than a few tens or\nhundreds of Schwarzschild radii, the accretion will proceed via a\nconvection-dominated accretion flow (CDAF) in which most of the matter escapes\nto infinity rather than falling onto the black hole. Models involving the\nmergers of black hole white dwarf binaries and black hole helium star binaries\nfall in this category. These models are unlikely to produce GRBs since very\nlittle mass reaches the black hole. If the accretion disk is smaller, then\naccretion will proceed via neutrino cooling in a neutrino-dominated accretion\ndisk (NDAF) and most of the mass will reach the center. Models involving the\nmergers of double neutron star binaries and black hole neutron star binaries\nfall in this category and are capable of producing bright GRBs. If the\nviscosity parameter $\\alpha$ in the NDAF has a standard value $\\sim0.1$, these\nmergers can explain short GRBs with durations under a second, but they are\nunlikely to produce long GRBs with durations of tens or hundred of seconds. If\nthe accretion disk is fed by fallback of material after a supernova explosion,\nas in the collapsar model, then the time scale of the burst is determined by\nfallback, not accretion. Such a model can produce long GRBs. Fallback models\nagain require that the accretion should proceed via an NDAF rather than a CDAF\nin order for a significant amount of mass to reach the black hole.

Special and general\nrelativistic effects influencing photons emitted by the disc are taken into\naccount. The emerging spectrum, as seen by a distant observer, is parametrized\nby the black hole mass and spin, the accretion rate, the disc inclination angle\nand the inner disc radius. We fit the ASCA soft state X-ray spectra of LMC X-1\nand GRO J1655-40 by this model. We find that having additional limits on the\nblack hole mass and inclination angle from optical/UV observations, we can\nconstrain the black hole spin from X-ray data. In LMC X-1 the constrain is\nweak, we can only rule out the maximally rotating black hole. In GRO J1655-40\nwe can limit the spin much better, and we find 0.68 < a < 0.88.

We show\nthat the broadband noise power spectra of the black hole candidate Cyg X-1 and\nthe accreting millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 are intrinsically\nnon-stationary, in that RMS variability scales linearly with flux.\nFlux-selected power spectra confirm that this effect is due to changes in\npower-spectral amplitude and not shape. The lightcurves of three Seyfert\ngalaxies are also consistent with a linear relationship between RMS variability\nand flux, suggesting that it is an intrinsic feature of the broadband noise\nvariability in compact accreting systems over more than 6 decades of central\nobject mass. The RMS variability responds to flux variations on all measured\ntime-scales, raising fundamental difficulties for shot-noise models which seek\nto explain this result by invoking variations in the shot parameters. We\nsuggest that models should be explored where the longest time-scale variations\nare fundamental and precede the variations on shorter time-scales. Possible\nmodels which can explain the linear RMS-flux relation include the fractal\nbreak-up of large coronal flares, or the propagation of fluctuations in mass\naccretion rate through the accretion disk. The linear relationship between RMS\nvariability and flux in Cyg X-1 and SAX J1808.4-3658 is offset on the flux\naxis, suggesting the presence of a second, constant-flux component to the\nlightcurve which contributes 25% of the total flux. The spectrum of this\nconstant component is similar to the total spectrum [abridged].",

The main molecular cloud L1688, as well as L1689N\nand L1689S, have been completely surveyed for point sources at 6.7 and 14.3\nmicron. A total of 425 sources are detected including 16 Class I, 123 Class II,\nand 77 Class III young stellar objects (YSOs). Essentially all of the mid-IR\nsources coincide with near-IR sources, but a large proportion of them are\nrecognized for the first time as YSOs. Our dual-wavelength survey allows us to\nidentify essentially all the YSOs with IR excess in the embedded cluster down\nto Fnu ~ 10 - 15 mJy. It more than doubles the known population of Class II\nYSOs and represents the most complete census to date of newly formed stars in\nthe rho Ophiuchi central region. The stellar luminosity function of the\ncomplete sample of Class II YSOs is derived with a good accuracy down to L=\n0.03 Lsun. A modeling of this lumino- sity function, using available pre-main\nsequence tracks and plausible star for- mation histories, allows us to derive\nthe mass distribution of the Class II YSOs which arguably reflects the IMF of\nthe embedded cluster. We estimate that the IMF in rho Ophiuchi is well\ndescribed by a two-component power law with a low- mass index of -0.35+/-0.25,\na high-mass index of -1.7 (to be compared with the Salpeter value of -1.35),\nand a break occurring at M = 0.55+/-0.25 Msun.

Using an\nautomatic and objective method (PLC technique) 117 objects were found.\nStatistical tests indicate that our sample is contaminated by less than 10 % of\nspurious detections due to random concentrations of blue stars. Spatial\ndistributions of detected associations and H II regions are strongly\ncorrelated. The size distribution reveals a significant peak at about 60\n$\\mu$rad which corresponds to 125 parsecs if a distance modulus of 26.66 mag is\nassumed. Besides the objects with sizes corresponding to typical associations\nwe also found several much larger objects. A second level application of our\ndetection method revealed that most of these are composed of smaller subgroups,\nwith sizes of about 100 pc.",

This relates the onset of massive star formation to a\ngeneral gravitational instability of the gas disks of spiral galaxies. It is\noften overlooked, however that such gravitational instabilities of the gas\ndisks have severe implications for the overall stability of the gas and star\ndisks of spiral galaxies. I show by numerical simulations of the evolution of a\ncombined gas and star disk that the violation of the stability condition\ninduces violent dynamical evolution of the combined system. In particular the\nstar disk heats up on time scales less than a Gyr to unrealistic high values of\nthe Toomre stability parameter Q. The morphologies of both the star and gas\ndisk resemble then no longer observed morphologies of spiral galaxies. Star\nformation of stars on low velocity dispersion orbits would lead to dynamical\ncooling of the disks to more realistic states. However, the required star\nformation rate is extremely high.",

KR 140 is a small (5.7 pc\ndiameter) HII region at a distance of 2.3+/-0.3 kpc. Five of the six IRAS point\nsources near KR 140 were mapped in this study. Our analysis shows that two of\nthese IRAS sources are embedded late B type stars lying well outside the HII\nregion, two are a part of the dust shell surrounding the HII region, and one is\nthe combined emission from an ensemble of smaller sources unresolved by IRAS.\nWe have discovered a number of relatively cold submillimeter sources not\nvisible in the IRAS data, ranging in size from 0.2 to 0.7 pc and in mass from\n0.5 to 130 Msun. The distribution of masses for all sources is well\ncharacterized by a power law N(>M) ~ M^{-alpha} with alpha = 0.5 +/- 0.04, in\nagreement with the typical mass function for clumped structures of this scale\nin molecular clouds. Several of the submillimeter sources are found at the\nHII-molecular gas interface and have probably been formed as the result of the\nexpansion of the HII region. Many of the submillimeter sources we detect are\ngravitationally bound and most of these follow a mass-size relationship\nexpected for objects in virial equilibrium with non-thermal pressure support.\nUpon the loss of non-thermal support they could be sites of star formation.\nAlong with the two B stars that we have identified as possible cluster members\nalong with VES 735, we argue that five nearby highly-reddened stars are in a\npre-main-sequence stage of evolution.",

Secondly,\nthe KIP imposes the form of the generalized entropy associated to the system\nand permits to obtain the particle statistical distribution, both as stationary\nsolution of the non linear evolution equation and as the state which maximizes\nthe generalized entropy. Thirdly, the KIP allows, on one hand, to treat all the\nclassical or quantum statistical distributions already known in the literature\nin a unifying scheme and, on the other hand, suggests how we can introduce\nnaturally new distributions. Finally, as a working example of the approach to\nthe non linear kinetics here presented, a new non extensive statistics is\nconstructed and studied starting from a one-parameter deformation of the\nexponential function holding the relation $f(-x)f(x)=1$.",

No\nstatistically significant deviations from the Standard Model expectations are\nobserved and lower limits, some obtained in dedicated analyses, for new physics\nphenomena at 95 % confidence level are derived. The scales of contact\ninteractions are constrained to lie above 10-20 TeV, depending on the helicity\nstructure. The Standard Model has thus been tested at LEP2 down to distances\n10^{-19} - 10^{-20} m. This has many implications, one example being the\ninterpretation of the new result on the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon\nas coming from muon substructure. For gamma-gamma final states the QED cut-offs\nare Lambda_+ > 0.44 TeV and Lambda_- > 0.37 TeV. In a combined analysis, using\ne+e- and gamma-gamma final states, the most stringent lower limits to date,\nM_s^+ > 1.13 TeV (lambda = +1) and M_s^- > 1.39 TeV (lambda = -1), on the low\ngravity effective Planck scale are set.

We also address\nthe fundamental question of how to accurately determine the {\\bf k}$_F$ value\nfrom ARPES. Both K$_{0.3}$MoO$_{3}$ and Li$_{0.9}$Mo$_{6}$O$_{17}$ show\nquasi-1D electronic structures with non-FL line shapes. A CDW gap opening is\nobserved for K$_{0.3}$MoO$_{3}$, whereas no gap is observed for\nLi$_{0.9}$Mo$_{6}$O$_{17}$. We show, however, that the standard CDW theory,\neven with strong fluctuations, is not sufficient to describe the non-FL line\nshapes of K$_{0.3}$MoO$_{3}$. We argue that a Luttinger liquid (LL) model is\nrelevant for both bronzes, but also point out difficulties encountered in\ncomparing data with theory.

    "summary": "Massive spin s>=3/2 fields can become partially massless in cosmological\nbackgrounds. In the plane spanned by m^2 and \\Lambda, there are lines where new\ngauge invariances permit intermediate sets of higher helicities, rather than\nthe usual flat space extremes of all 2s+1 massive or just 2 massless\nhelicities. These gauge lines divide the (m^2,\\Lambda) plane into unitarily\nallowed or forbidden intermediate regions where all 2s+1 massive helicities\npropagate but lower helicity states can have negative norms. We derive these\nconsequences for s=3/2,2 by studying both their canonical (anti)commutators and\nthe transmutation of massive constraints to partially massless Bianchi\nidentities. For s=2, a Hamiltonian analysis exhibits the absence of zero\nhelicity modes in the partially massless sector. For s=5/2,3 we derive Bianchi\nidentities and their accompanying gauge invariances for the various partially\nmassless theories with propagating helicities (+/-5/2,+/-3/2) and (+/-3,+/-2),\n(+/-3,+/-2,+/-1), respectively. Of these, only the s=3 models are unitary. To\nthese ends, we also provide the half integer generalization of the integer spin\nwave operators of Lichnerowicz. Partial masslessness applies to all higher\nspins in (A)dS as seen by their degree of freedom counts. Finally a derivation\nof massive d=4 constraints by dimensional reduction from their d=5 massless\nBianchi identity ancestors is given.",

We also\nprovide estimates, in terms of the physical parameters of the equations, for\nthe Hausdorff and fractal dimensions of their global attractor. In analogy with\nthe Kolmogorov theory of turbulence, we define a small spatial scale,\n\\ell_{\\epsilon}, as the scale at which the balance occurs in the mean rates of\nnonlinear transport of energy and viscous dissipation of energy. Furthermore,\nwe show that the number of degrees of freedom in the long-time behavior of the\nsolutions to these equations is bounded from above by (L/\\ell_{epsilon})^3,\nwhere L is a typical large spatial scale (e.g., the size of the domain). This\nestimate suggests that the Landau-Lifshitz classical theory of turbulence is\nsuitable for interpreting the solutions of the NS-alpha equations. Hence, one\nmay consider these equations as a closure model for the Reynolds averaged\nNavier-Stokes equations (NSE). We study this approach, further, in other\nrelated papers. Finally, we discuss the relation of the NS-alpha model to the\nNSE by proving a convergence theorem, that as the length scale alpha tends to\nzero a subsequence of solutions of the NS-alpha equations converges to a weak\nsolution of the three dimensional NSE.",

We present\nVLA ammonia maps of the IRAS 05413-0104 molecular gas envelope in which the\nprotostellar jet source is embedded. We find that the envelope, with mass of\n0.2 M(sun) detected by the interferometer, is flattened perpendicular to the\njet axis with a FWHM diameter of 12000 AU and an axis ratio of 2:1, as seen in\nNH3 (1,1) emission. There is a velocity gradient of about 4-5 km sec^-1 pc^-1\nacross the flattened disk-like core, suggestive of rotation around an axis\naligned with the jet. Flux-weighted mean velocities increase smoothly with\nradius with a roughly constant velocity gradient. In young (Class 0) systems\nsuch as HH212, a significant amount of material is still distributed in a large\nsurrounding envelope, and thus the observable kinematics of the system may\nreflect the less centrally condensed, youthful state of the source and\nobscuration of central dynamics. The angular momentum of this envelope material\nmay be released from infalling gas through rotation in the HH212 jet, as recent\nobservations suggest (Davis et al. 2000). A blue-shifted wisp or bowl of\nemitting gas appears to be swept up along the blue side of the outflow,\npossibly lining the cavity of a wider angle wind around the more collimated\nshock jet axis. Our ammonia (2,2)/(1,1) ratio map indicates that this very cold\ncore is heated to 14 Kelvin degrees in a centrally condensed area surrounding\nthe jet source. This edge-on core and jet system appears to be young and deeply\nembedded. This environment, however, is apparently not disrupting the pristine\nsymmetry and collimation of the jet.",

The absence of static friction results from the fact that\nthe atomic level interfacial potential energy is much weaker than the elastic\npotential energy, which prevents the atoms from sinking to their interfacial\npotential minima. Consequently, we have essentially two rigid solids, for which\nthe forces at randomly distributed \"pinning sites\" cancel. It is shown here\nthat even fluctuations in the concentration of atomic level defects at the\ninterface do not account for static friction. It is also argued that the\nsliding of contacting asperities, which occurs when the problem is studied at\nthe multi-micron length scale, relative to each other involves the shearing of\nplanes of atoms. Since this results in a force for the interaction of two\nasperities which varies over sliding distances of the order of an atomic\nspacing, the contacting asperities at the surface are able to sink to their\ninterfacial potential minima, with negligible cost in elastic potential energy.\nThis results in static friction.",

    "summary": "Thin superconducting films of magnesium diboride (MgB2) with Tc \\approx 24K\nwere prepared on various oxide substrates by pulsed laser deposition (PLD)\nfollowed by an in-situ anneal. A systematic study of the influence of various\nin-situ annealing parameters shows an optimum temperature of about 600C in a\nbackground of 0.7 atm. of Ar/4%H2 for layers consisting of a mixture of\nmagnesium and boron. Contrary to ex-situ approaches (e.g. reacting boron films\nwith magnesium vapor at 900C), these films are processed below the\ndecomposition temperature of MgB2. This may prove enabling in the formation of\nmultilayers, junctions, and epitaxial films in future work. Issues related to\nthe improvement of these films and to the possible in-situ growth of MgB2 at\nelevated temperature are discussed.",

The commutative version of the two\ndimensional model is a renormalizable quantum field theory, both in a coupling\nconstant expansion and an expansion in 1/N. The non-commutative version has a\nrenormalizable coupling constant expansion where ultraviolet divergences can be\nremoved by adjusting counterterms to each order. On the other hand, in a\nprevious work, we showed that the non-commutative theory is not renormalizable\nin the large N expansion. This is argued to be due to a combined effect of\nasymptotic freedom and the ultraviolet/infrared mixing that occurs in a\nnon-commutative field theory. In the present paper we will elaborate on this\nresult and extend it to study the large N limit of the three dimensional\nGross-Neveu model. We shall see that the large N limit of the three dimensional\ntheory is also trivial when the ultraviolet cutoff is removed.",

There are some observational indications that the\ndark matter distribution in galaxies might be characterized by a finite core.\nThis `core catastrophe' has prompted a search for alternatives to the CDM\ncosmogony. It is shown here that the discrepancy between theory and\nobservations can be very naturally resolved within the standard CDM model,\nprovided that gas is not initially smoothly distributed in the dark matter\nhalo, but rather is concentrated in clumps of mass $\\geq 0.01 %$ the total mass\nof the system. Dynamical friction acting on these lumps moving in the\nbackground of the dark matter particles, dissipates the clumps orbital energy\nand deposits it in the dark matter. Using Monte-Carlo simulations, it is shown\nthat the dynamical friction provides a strong enough drag, and that with\nrealistic baryonic mass fractions, the available orbital energy of the clumps\nis sufficient to heat the halo and turn the primordial cusp into a finite,\nnon-diverging core --- overcoming the competing effect of adiabatic contraction\ndue to gravitational influence of the shrinking baryonic component. Depending\non the initial conditions, the total density distribution may either become\nmore or less centrally concentrated. Possible consequences of the proposed\nmechanism for other problems in the CDM model and for the formation and early\nevolution of the baryonic component of galaxies are also briefly discussed.",

The amplitude of both universal conductance fluctuations (UCF)\nand Aharonov-Bohm effect (ABE) is enhanced several times for voltages larger\nthan the Thouless energy. The enhancement persists even in the presence of\ninelastic electron-electron scattering up to V ~ 1 mV. For larger voltages\nelectron-phonon collisions lead to the amplitude decaying as a power law for\nthe UCF and exponentially for the ABE. We obtain good agreement of the\nexperimental data with a model which takes into account the decrease of the\nelectron phase-coherence length due to electron-electron and electron-phonon\nscattering.",

A general case\nof unequal oscillator strengths of the transitions is considered. Durations of\nthe probe pulse and the coupling pulse $T_{1,2}$ ($T_2>T_1$) are assumed to be\nshorter than any of the relevant atomic relaxation times. We propose analytical\nand numerical solutions of a self-consistent set of coupled Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequations and reduced wave equations in the adiabatic limit with the account of\nthe first non-adiabatic correction. The adiabaticity criterion is also\ndiscussed with the account of the pulse propagation. The dynamics of\npropagation is found to be strongly dependent on the ratio of the transition\noscillator strengths. It is shown that envelopes of the pulses slightly change\nthroughout the medium length at the initial stage of propagation. This distance\ncan be large compared to the one-photon resonant absorption length. Eventually,\nthe probe pulse is completely reemitted into the coupling pulse during\npropagation.

    "summary": "The conventional supersymmetric grand unified theories suffer from two\nserious problems, the large mass splitting between doublet and triplet Higgs\nmultiplets, and the too long lifetime of the proton. A unification model based\non a semi-simple group SU(5)_{GUT} \\times U(3)_H has been proposed to solve\nboth of the problems simultaneously. Although the proposed model is perfectly\nconsistent with observations, there are various mysteries. In this paper, we\nshow that such mysterious features in the original model are naturally\nexplained by embedding the model into the brane world in a higher dimensional\nspace-time. In particular, the relatively small gauge coupling constant of the\nSU(5)_{GUT} at the unification energy scale is a consequence of relatively\nlarge volume of extra dimensions. Here, we put the SU(5)_{GUT} gauge multiplet\nin a 6-dimensional bulk and assume all fields in the U(3)_H sector to reside on\na 3-dimensional brane located in the bulk. On the other hand, all chiral\nmultiplets of quarks, leptons and Higgs are assumed to reside on a 3-brane at a\nT^2/Z_4 orbifold fixed point. The quasi-N=2 supersymmetry in the hypercolor\nU(3)_H sector is understood as a low-energy remnant of the N=4 supersymmetry in\na 6-dimensional space-time. We further extend the 6-dimensional model to a\n10-dimensional theory. Possible frameworks of string theories are also\ninvestigated to accommodate the present brane-world model.

    "summary": "We show that the two groups of ultracool dwarfs classified as L and T types\ncan be understood as a temperature effect in a unique sequence of the model\nphotospheres in which dust always exists but only in the restricted region deep\nin the photosphere. Under the high density of the photospheres of cool dwarfs,\ndust forms easily at the condensation temperature T_cond (about 2000 K), but\nthe dust will soon grow larger than the critical radius r_cr at the critical\ntemperature T_cr (about 1800 K). The large dust grains with r > r_cr will soon\nsegregate from the gas and precipitate below the photosphere. For this reason,\ndust exists only in the limited region of T_cr < T < T_cond in the photo-\nsphere which we referred to as an active dust zone, and this means that a cloud\nlayer is formed deep in the photosphere rather than in the cooler surface\nregion. With the simple assumption that only small dust grains (r < r_cr) can\nbe sustained in the photosphere, a self- consistent non-grey model photosphere\nin radiative-convective equilibrium can be developed without any other ad-hoc\nassumption. We show that the spectra and colours of L (the cloud layer appears\nin the optically thin region) and T (the dust cloud is situated too deep to be\nobservable) dwarfs can consistently be reproduced by a single grid of our\nunified model photospheres.",

In order to test unifying schemes for radio-loud objects,\ntheir spectral and statistical properties (both flat and steep spectrum\nobjects) are examined and compared with those of other samples of blazars. The\nX-ray selection allows us to explore properties of radio-loud quasars 10-100\nweaker in the radio band than classical samples. The most convincing\ninterpretation of our results is that there are no radio-loud quasars whose\nsynchrotron emission peak reaches the EUV-soft X-ray band at these (radio) flux\nlevels. Moreover, due to the comparatively weak non-thermal emission, a\nquasi-thermal component appears to contribute at optical-UV energies. The\ndetection of sources at low radio fluxes also reveals a large population of\nsteep spectrum quasars and the lack of the predicted turnover in the quasar\n(radio) counts. The evolution of X-ray selected radio-loud quasars does not\nsignificantly differ from that of radio-selected ones, and flat spectrum and\nsteep spectrum sources appear to behave quite similarly.",

The lines of constant physics corresponding to fixed values of the\nratio $m_{\\rm PS}/m_{\\rm V}$ of the pseudo-scalar to vector meson masses at\nzero temperature are determined, and the beta functions which describe the\nrenormalization-group flow along these lines are calculated.

The formalism of effective medium theory is\nthen applied for calculation of dielectric permittivity, optical and EELS\nspectra of $La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_4$ with $x$ varying in a wide range. Reasonable\nsemi-quantitative agreement with experiment has been obtained even for the\nsimplest version of the theory.

Substantial difference in spectral and doping dependence of optical\nabsorption for the thin-film and bulk samples is easily explained if only to\nassume different shape of metallic and dielectric regions in both materials.\nNew peaks in optical conductivity and absorption spectra, that emerge in the\nmidinfrared range near 0.5 and 1.5 eV upon doping are attributed to geometrical\n(Mie's) resonances. Overall, we point out that all main peculiarities of the\ndoping effect on optical and EELS spectra for cuprates including the spectral\nchanges accompanying the insulator-to-metal transition can be explained rather\nprosaically by recognizing that the doping results in emergence of nanoscopic\nmetallic stripe-like droplets.",

Our main focus\nis on the regularities displayed by the long-run distribution of diffusion\nwaves and their implication on the performance of the system. By integrating\nanalytical techniques and numerical simulations, we come to the following two\nmain conclusions. (1) If dis-coordination costs are sufficiently high, the\nsystem behaves critically, in the sense customarily used in physics. (2) The\nperformance of the system is optimal at the frontier of the critical region.\nHeuristically, this may be interpreted as an indication that\n(performance-sensitive) evolutionary forces induce the system to be placed ``at\nthe edge of order and chaos''",

The relative\ndifferences that have been previously detected in 2-D simulations involving\ndistinct magnetic field configurations are diminished in the 3-D flows. While\nthe presence of toroidal magnetic components can modify the morphology close to\nthe jet head inhibiting its fragmentation in the early jet evolution, as\npreviously reported in the literature, the impact of the pulsed-induced\ninternal knots causes the appearance of a complex morphology at the jet head\n(as required by the observations of H-H jets) even in the MHD jet models with\ntoroidal components. The detailed structure and emission properties of the\ninternal working surfaces can be also significantly altered by the presence of\nmagnetic fields. The increase of the magnetic field strength improves the jet\ncollimation, and amplifies the density (by factors up to 1.4, and 4) and the\nH\\alpha$ intensity (by factors up to 4, and 5) behind the knots of jets with\nhelical field and $\\beta \\simeq 1-0.1$ (respectively), relative to a non\nmagnetic jet. As a consequence, the corresponding $I_{[SII]}}/I_{H}\\alpha}$\nratio (which is frequently used to determine the excitation level of HH\nobjects) can be decreased in the MHD models with toroidal components relative\nto non-magnetic calculations. We also find that the helical mode of the K-H\ninstability can be triggered in MHD models with helical magnetic fields,\ncausing some jet wiggling. No evidence for the formation of the nose cones is\nfound in the 3-D flows, nor even in the $\\beta \\simeq 0.1$ case.",

The structure near 284 cm$^{-1}$ displays the\nlargest deviation with field and is mainly intensity related. A comparison\nbetween the temperature dependent absorption difference spectra, the gradual\nlow-temperature cluster framework distortion as assessed by neutron diffraction\ndata, and field dependent absorption difference spectra suggests that this mode\nmay involve Mn motion in the crown.",

The cell shape effect was\nqualitatively simulated by an ellipsoidal cell model. However, the comparison\nbetween theory and experiment was far from being satisfactory. In an attempt to\nclose up the gap between theory and experiment, we considered the more\nrealistic cells of spherocylinders, i.e., circular cylinders with two\nhemispherical caps at both ends. We have formulated a Green function formalism\nfor calculating the spectral representation of cells of finite length. The\nGreen function can be reduced because of the azimuthal symmetry of the cell.\nThis simplification enables us to calculate the dispersion spectrum and hence\naccess the effect of cell structure on the dielectric behavior of cell\nsuspensions.",

    "summary": "We examine the effects of optically thick line forces on orbiting\ncircumstellar disks, such as occur around Be stars. For radially streaming\nradiation, line forces are only effective if there is a strong radial velocity\ngradient, as occurs, for example, in a line-driven stellar wind. However,\nwithin an orbiting disk, the radial shear of the azimuthal velocity leads to\nstrong line-of-sight velocity velocity gradients along nonradial directions. As\nsuch, in the proximity of a stellar surface extending over a substantial cone\nangle, the nonradial stellar radiation can impart a significant line force,\neven in the case of purely circular orbits. Given the highly supersonic nature\nof orbital velocity variations, we use the Sobolev approximation, thereby\nextending to the disk case the standard CAK formalism developed for line-driven\nwinds. We delineate the parameter regimes for which radiative forces might\nalter disk properties; but even when radiative forces are small, we\nanalytically quantify higher-order effects in the linear limit, including the\nprecession of weakly elliptical orbits. We find that optically thick line\nforces can have observable implications for the dynamics of disks around Be\nstars, including the generation of either prograde or retrograde precession in\nslightly eccentric orbits. However, our analysis suggests a net retrograde\neffect, in apparent contradiction with observed long-term variations of\nviolet/red line profile asymmetries from Be stars, which are generally thought\nto result from prograde propagation of a so-called ``one arm mode''. We also\nconclude that radiative forces may alter the dynamical properties at the\nsurface of the disk where disk winds originate, and may even make low-density\ndisks vulnerable to being blown away.",

In analogy to the\nnonrelativistic case, the off-diagonal perturbation leads to a lifting of the\ndegeneracy in the mass spectrum. In the covariant case, not only do the\nspectral lines split, but they acquire an imaginary part which is lnear in the\napplied electric field, thus revealing induced bound state decay in first order\nperturbation theory. This imaginary part results from the coupling of the\nexternal field to the non-compact boost generator. In order to recover the\nconventional first order Stark splitting, we must include a scalar potential\nterm.

    "summary": "We study the stability of poloidal magnetic fields anchored in a thin\naccretion disc. The two-dimensional hydrodynamics in the disc plane is followed\nby a grid-based numerical simulation including the vertically integrated\nmagnetic forces. The 3--dimensional magnetic field outside the disc is\ncalculated in a potential field approximation from the magnetic flux density\ndistribution in the disc. For uniformly rotating discs we confirm numerically\nthe existence of the interchange instability as predicted by Spruit, Stehle &\nPapaloizou (1995). In agreement with predictions from the shearing sheet model,\ndiscs with Keplerian rotation are found to be stabilized by the shear, as long\nas the contribution of magnetic forces to support against gravity is small.\nWhen this support becomes significant, we find a global instability which\ntransports angular momentum outward and allows mass to accrete inward. The\ninstability takes the form of a $m=1$ rotating `crescent', reminiscent of the\npurely hydrodynamic nonlinear instability previously found in\npressure-supported discs. A model where the initial surface mass density\n$\\Sigma(r)$ and $B_{\\mathrm{z}}(r)$ decrease with radius as power laws shows\ntransient mass accretion during about 6 orbital periods, and settles into a\nstate with surface density and field strength decreasing approximately\nexponentially with radius. We argue that this instability is likely to be the\nmain angular momentum transport mechanism in discs with a poloidal magnetic\nfield sufficiently strong to suppress magnetic turbulence. It may be especially\nrelevant in jet-producing discs.",

Our usual\nprocedure (``quenched minimization'') seems to be a compromise between these\ncriteria, and yields string tensions at an intermediate value close to the full\nstring tension.",

The continuum\nemission is well modeled with a power law that steepens at high energies, with\nan e-folding energy of about 120 keV. At soft energies a clear excess of\nemission is detected, which can not be explained solely by the extended thermal\nhalo seen in a ROSAT HRI image. A second, more intense soft X-ray component,\npossibly related to an accretion disk, is required by the data. Both a\nreflection component (R=0.3) and an iron line (EW \\sim 50) are detected, at\nlevels much weaker than in Seyfert galaxies, suggesting a common origin.\nCombining our measurements with results from the literature we find that the\niron line has remained approximately constant over 9 years while the continuum\nvaried by a factor of 5. Thus the fluorescent gas does not respond promptly to\nthe variations of the X-ray primary source, suggesting that the reprocessing\nsite is located away, likely at parsec distances. While the continuum shape\nindicates that X-rays derive from a thermal Comptonization process, the\nweakness of other spectral features implies that either the upper layers of the\noptically thick accretion disk are completely ionized or the corona above the\ndisk is outflowing with mildly relativistic velocity.",

The\nmolecular mass in the 33'' Onsala 20m beam is estimated to be >= 8.5 x 10^7\nM_{sun} which is at least 4% of the total molecular mass measured so far in\nthis system. We suggest that the emission is a molecular tidal tail which is\npart of the extended structure of the main body, and that the molecular gas was\nthrown out by the collision instead of having formed in situ from condensing\natomic material. We find it unlikely that the emission is associated with a\ntidal dwarf galaxy (even if the future formation of such an object is\npossible), but high resolution HI, CO and optical observations are necessary to\nresolve the issue. The Medusa is very likely the result of an elliptical+spiral\ncollison and our detection supports the notion that molecular gas in minor\nmergers can be found at great distances from the merger centre.",

The observed\ndispersions in K {\\sc i} and Li {\\sc i} equivalent widths for Pleiades stars\ncan be partially accounted by the simultaneous effects of activity on colors\nand the line formation, indicating that the lithium-rotation connection\nsuggested for ~0.7-0.9 Msun Pleiades stars could be due in part to the stellar\nactivity. However, under realistic values for the filling factors, only a small\nportion of the observed spread could be explained by these effects",

In particular, a substantial degree of\nconvergence is needed if the European Central Bank is to be capable of setting\na monetary policy which is appropriate to the stage of the cycle of the Euro\nzone economies.\n  We consider the annual rates of real GDP growth on a quarterly basis in the\nlarge core economies of the EU (France, Germany and Italy, plus the\nNetherlands) over the period 1978Q1 - 2000Q3. An important empirical question\nis the degree to which the correlations between these growth rates contain true\ninformation rather than noise. The technique of random matrix theory is able to\nanswer this question, and has been recently applied successfully in the physics\njournals to financial markets data.\n  We find that the correlations between the growth rates of the core EU\neconomies contain substantial amounts of true information, and exhibit\nconsiderable stability over time. Even in the late 1970s and early 1980s, these\neconomies moved together closely over the course of the business cycle. There\nwas a slight loosening at the time of German re-unification, but the economies\nare now, if anything, even more closely correlated.\n  In contrast, the results obtained with a data set of the EU core plus the UK\nshow no such trend. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the UK economy did\nexhibit some degree of correlation with those of the core EU. However, there is\nno clear evidence to suggest that the UK business cycle has moved more closely\ninto line with that of the core EU economies over the 1978-2000 period.",

Globally\nN83B displays a turbulent environment typical of newborn massive star formation\nsites. It contains an impressive ridge, likely created by a shock and a cavity\nwith an estimated age of only ~30,000 yr, sculpted in the ionized gas by the\npowerful winds of massive stars. The observations bring to light two compact\nHII blobs, N83B-1 and N83B-2, and a small arc-nebula, N83B-3, lying inside the\nlarger HII region. N83B-1, only ~2.8\" (0.7 pc) across, is the brightest and\nmost excited part of N83B. It harbors the presumably hottest star of the burst\nand is also strongly affected by dust with an extinction of Av=2.5 mag. The\nsecond blob, N83B-2, is even more compact, with a size of only ~1\" (0.3 pc).\nAll three features are formed in the border zone between the molecular cloud\nand the ionized gas possibly in a sequential process triggered by the\nionization front of an older HII region. Our HST imaging presents an\ninteresting and rare opportunity to observe details in the morphology of the\nstar formation in very small spatial scales in the LMC which are in agreement\nwith the concept of the fractal structure of molecular star forming clouds.

Distortion of the electronic wavefunctions leads to hyperfine\nmagnetic interactions with the nuclear spin.\n  Our model describes both the modification of the phonon spectra, localized\nmodes (\"vacancies\") and the nuclear magnetic ordering of bcc $^{3}$He using a\nsingle parameter, the dipolar interaction energy $E_{0}$. The model yields\ncorrectly both the u2d2 symmetry of the ordered phase and the volume dependence\nof the magnetic interaction. We calculate the magnetic excitations in the u2d2\nphase, which compare well with the measured specific-heat, free energy and\nentropy.

For instance, the picture of space\nfilling sponges seems to survive in the large volume limit at T>0, while\nentropic effects play a crucial role in determining the free-energy degeneracy\nof our finite volume states. All of our analysis is applied to equilibrium\nconfigurations obtained by a parallel tempering on 512 different disorder\nrealizations. First, we consider the spatial properties of the sites where\npairs of independent spin configurations differ and we introduce a modified\nspin overlap distribution which exhibits a non-trivial limit for large L.\nSecond, after removing the Z_2 (+-1) symmetry, we cluster spin configurations\ninto valleys. On average these valleys have free-energy differences of O(1),\nbut a difference in the (extensive) internal energy that grows significantly\nwith L; there is thus a large interplay between energy and entropy\nfluctuations.

This intermittency, when measured from relative\nscaling exponents of structure functions, is more pronounced than in the\nEulerian framework.",

    "summary": "The central engine causing the production of jets in radio sources may work\nintermittently, accelerating shells of plasma with different mass, energy and\nvelocity. Faster but later shells can then catch up slower earlier ones. In the\nresulting collisions shocks develop, converting some of the ordered bulk\nkinetic energy into magnetic field and random energy of the electrons which\nthen radiate. We propose that this internal shock scenario, which is the\nscenario generally thought to explain the observed gamma-ray burst radiation,\ncan work also for radio sources in general, and for blazar in particular. We\ninvestigate in detail this idea, simulating the birth, propagation and\ncollision of shells, calculating the spectrum produced in each collision, and\nsumming the locally produced spectra from those regions of the jet which are\nsimultaneously active in the observer's frame. We can thus construct snapshots\nof the overall spectral energy distribution as well as time dependent spectra\nand light curves. This allows us to characterize the predicted variability at\nany frequency, study correlations among the emission at different frequencies,\nspecify the contribution of each region of the jet to the total emission, find\ncorrelations between flares at high energies and the birth of superluminal\nradio knots and/or radio flares. The model has been applied to qualitatively\nreproduce the observed properties of 3C 279. Global agreement in terms of both\nspectra and temporal evolution is found. In a forthcoming work, we explore the\nconstraints which this scenario sets on the initial conditions of the plasma\ninjected in the jet and the shock dissipation for different classes of blazars.",

The problem which\nmotivates this paper is to determine the $(M, g)$ with maximal eigenfunction\ngrowth. Our main result is that such an $(M, g)$ must have a point $x$ where\nthe set ${\\mathcal L}_x$ of geodesic loops at $x$ has positive measure in\n$S^*_x M$. We show that if $(M, g)$ is real analytic, this puts topological\nrestrictions on $M$, e.g. only $M = S^2$ (topologically) in dimension 2 can\npossess a real analytic metric of maximal eigenfunction growth. We further show\nthat generic metrics on any $M$ fail to have maximal eigenfunction growth. In\naddition, we construct an example of $(M, g)$ for which ${\\mathcal L}_x$ has\npositive measure for an open set of $x$ but which does not have maximal\neigenfunction growth, thus disproving a naive converse to the main result.",

The\nresulting range in estimated ages, some of which are very young encounters\n(~5x10^7 yr), is not predicted by merger models, which produce high rates of\nstar formation either 1-2x10^8 years after the first encounter or very late\n(~10^9 yr) in the merger process. Even in the very young mergers, the\nultraluminous activity appears to be centrally concentrated on the nucleus of\none of the progenitor galaxies---namely the galaxy with a prograde orbital\ngeometry. Very high star formation rates (2-5 M_sun/yr) are also observed in\nstructures believed to be newly formed tidal tails.\n  The presence of a significant population of very young ultraluminous mergers,\ntogether with the majority of ultraluminous infrared galaxies existing in the\nfinal stages of merger activity, indicates that the ultraluminous galaxy phase\nis at least bimodal in time. An evolutionary scenario is proposed for\nultraluminous infrared galaxies, wherein the far-infrared luminosity may\nundergo multiple ultraluminous bursts during the course of the encounter.

A necessary\ningredient of this method is the notion of free vertex algebra. Borcherds\n\\cite{bor} was the first to note that free vertex algebras do not exist in\ngeneral. The reason for this is that vertex algebras do not form a variety of\nalgebras, because the locality axiom (see sec 2 below) is not an identity.\nHowever, a certain subcategory of vertex algebras, obtained by restricting the\norder of locality of generators, has a universal object, which we call the free\nvertex algebra corresponding to the given locality bound. In [J. of Algebra,\n217(2):496-527] some free vertex algebras were constructed and in certain\nspecial cases their linear bases were found. In this paper we generalize this\nconstruction and find linear bases of an arbitrary free vertex algebra.\n  It turns out that free vertex algebras are closely related to the vertex\nalgebras corresponding to integer lattices. The latter algebras play a very\nimportant role in different areas of mathematics and physics. Here we explore\nthe relation between free vertex algebras and lattice vertex algebras in much\ndetail. These results comply with the use of the word \"free\" in physical\nliterature refering to some elements of lattice vertex algebras, like in \"free\nfield\", \"free bozon\" or \"free fermion\".\n  Among other things, we find a nice presentation of lattice vertex algebras in\nterms of generators and relations, thus giving an alternative construction of\nthese algebras without using vertex operators. We remark that our construction\nworks in a very general setting; we do not assume the lattice to be positive\ndefinite, neither non-degenerate, nor of a finite rank.",

It is\npossible that some discrete-field manifestations have already been observed in\nthe flat rotation curves of galaxies and in the apparent anomalous acceleration\nof the Pioneer spacecrafts. The existence of a critical point is equivalent to\nthe introduction of an effective-acceleration scale which may put Milgrom's\nMOND on a more solid physical basis.

It is argued that the\nemergence of magnetic (anti)monopoles in the vacuum at resolution $\\La_b$ is a\ndirect consequence of the randomness in the formation of a low entropy Higgs\ncondensate. This implies a breaking of chiral symmetry and a proliferation of\nthe axial U(1) anomaly at this scale already. Justifying Abelian projection, a\ndecoupling of non-Abelian gauge field fluctuations from the dynamics occurs.\nThe condensation of (anti)monopoles at $\\La_c<\\La_b$ follows from the demand\nthat vacuum fields ought to have vanishing action at any resolution. As\nmonopoles condense they are reduced to their cores, and hence they become\nmassless. Apparently broken gauge symmetries at resolutions $\\La_c<\\La\\le\\La_b$\nare restored in this process.",

Optical observations of H-beta and He\nI emission show a clear illumination effect, where high energy photons from the\nhot component ionize the outer atmosphere of the red giant. Simple illumination\nmodels generally account for the magnitude of the optical and ultraviolet\nemission line fluxes.

Monitoring programs that track the evolution of the thermal and\npower-law components in the X-ray spectrum provide new insights into modes of\nenergy flow and the formation of relativistic jets.",

We compare our spectra to STARBURST99 evolutionary synthesis\nmodels which incorporate a new low metallicity atlas of O-star spectra. We\nfavor a scenario which accounts for the paucity of O-stars in the field without\nrequiring the field to have a different IMF than the clusters: stellar clusters\nform continuously and then dissolve on ~10 Myr timescales and disperse their\nremaining stars into the field.

    "summary": "If gamma-ray burst (GRB) emission is strongly collimated then GRBs occur\nthroughout the Universe at a rate much higher than is detected. Since the\nemission from the optical afterglow is thought to be more isotropic than the\ngamma-ray emission, it has been hypothesized that a search for orphan\nafterglows (those without the triggering GRB) would allow strong constraints to\nbe placed on the degree of GRB collimation. We show here that, within the\ncontext of leading models of GRB jet evolution, measurement of the GRB beaming\nangle using optical orphan searches is extremely difficult, perhaps impossible\nin practice. This is because in the leading model of GRB jets, the effective\nafterglow beaming angle scales with the jet angle for small angles, and so the\nratio of detected orphan afterglows to GRBs is independent of the jet opening\nangle. Thus, the number of expected afterglow detections is the same for\nmoderate jet angles (e.g. 20 deg) as for arbitrarily small jet angles (<< 0.1\ndeg). For nearly isotropic GRB geometry, or for radio afterglow searches in\nwhich the jet has become non-relativistic, the ratio of afterglows to GRBs may\ngive information on collimation. However, using a simple model we estimate the\nexpected number of orphan detections in current supernova surveys, and find\nthis number to be less than one, for all jet opening angles. Even for future\nsupernova surveys, the small detection rate and lack of dependence on\ncollimation angle appear to ruin the prospects of determining GRB beaming by\nthis method. Radio searches may provide the best hope to find the missing\norphans.",

Recently it\nwas found that in the quantum regime, where tunnelling contributes to\ntransport, the net current may change sign with temperature. Here we show that\na Landauer model of an experimental tunnelling ratchet [Linke et. al., Science\n286, 2314 (1999)] predicts the existence of a net heat current even when the\nnet particle current goes through zero. We quantify this heat current and\ndefine a coefficient of performance for the ratchet as a heat pump, finding\nthat more heat is deposited in each of the two electron reservoirs due to the\nprocess of rocking than is pumped from one reservoir to the other by the\nratchet.",

The average radial\ndensity and velocity profiles are similar to those previously measured within\nthe bulk and on the lower surface of the 3D cell filled with mustard seeds.\nObservations of the evolution of particle velocities over time reveal distinct\nmotion events, intervals where previously stationary particles move for a short\nduration before jamming again. The cross-correlation between the velocities of\ntwo particles at a given distance $r$ from the moving wall reveals a\ncharacteristic lengthscale over which the particles are correlated. The\nautocorrelation of a single particle's velocity reveals a characteristic\ntimescale $\\tau$ which decreases with distance from the inner moving wall. This\nmay be attributed to the increasing rarity at which the discrete motion events\noccur and the reduced duration of those events at large $r$.

Most of the companions are dwarf\ngalaxies which due to observational selection effects were previously\ndisregarded in environmental studies of SFDGs. A subsample at low redshift,\ncz<2000 km/s, was chosen to partially eliminate the observational bias against\ndistant dwarf companions. We find companion candidates for approximately 30% of\nthe objects within a projected linear separation s_p<100 kpc and a redshift\ndifference (Delta cz)<500 km/s. The limited completeness of the available data\nsets, together with the non-negligible frequency of HI clouds in the vicinity\nof SFDGs indicated by recent radio surveys, suggest that a considerably larger\nfraction of these galaxies may be accompanied by low-mass systems. This casts\ndoubt on the hypothesis that the majority of them can be considered truly\nisolated. The velocity differences between companion candidates and sample\nSFDGs amount typically to (Delta cz)<250 km/s, and show a rising distribution\ntowards lower (Delta cz). This is similarly found for dwarf satellites of\nspiral galaxies, suggesting a physical association between the companion\ncandidates and the sample SFDGs. SFDGs with a close companion do not show\nsignificant differences in their Hbeta equivalent widths and B-V colours as\ncompared to isolated ones. However, the available data do not allow us to rule\nout that interactions with close dwarf companions can influence the star\nformation activity in SFDGs.",

High-resolution HST images are compared to our ground-based\ndata, obtained as part of the DIRECT project, for a sample of 102 Cepheids in\nthe M33 galaxy. The average (median) flux contribution from luminous companions\nnot resolved on the ground-based images in the B, V and I bands (S_B, S_V, S_I)\nis about 29% (15%), 24% (14%), 30% (21%) of the flux of the Cepheid. For 64\nCepheids with periods in excess of 10 days the average (median) values of S_B,\nS_V, S_I are 20% (10%), 16% (7%), 23% (14%). This shows that, depending on the\nsample of objects chosen, the distance derived from our ground-based V-band\nmagnitudes for the M33 Cepheids would be systematically underestimated by about\n8%-11% (3%-6%). Using artificial star tests we study crowding and blending as\nseparate phenomena. These tests indicate that the effect of blending could be\nmore significant than crowding in regions of lower surface brightness, below\n21.6 mag/arcsec^2. We also find indications that in the case of long period\nCepheids (P>10^d) companions from blending are on average bluer than companions\nintroduced by crowding. Our ground-based resolution in M33 corresponds to the\nHST resolution at about 11 Mpc. We estimate the effect of blending at\nresolutions corresponding to a range of distances as observed with the HST\nusing the HST M33 data as the template unblended population.

These data show\nthat, despite a very strong ultrasoft X-ray excess below 0.3 keV and a soft\n0.3--2 keV spectral index in earlier ROSAT data, the hard X-ray spectrum\n(alpha~ -0.8; 0.6-10 keV) is typical of type 1 AGN, and the soft component has\nsince disappeared. Optical data taken at two different epochs show that the big\nblue bump is also highly variable. The strength of the ultrasoft X-ray\ncomponent and the extreme variability in RE J2248-511 are reminiscent of the\nbehaviour observed in many narrow line Seyfert 1s (NLS1s). However, the high\nenergy end of the ROSAT spectrum, the ASCA spectrum and the Balmer line full\nwidths at half maximum of ~3000 km/s in RE J2248-511, are typical of normal\nSeyfert 1 AGN.\n  The change in the soft X-ray spectrum as observed in the ROSAT and ASCA data\nis consistent with the behaviour of Galactic Black Hole Candidates (GBHCs) as\nthey move from a high to a low state, ie. a fall in the ultrasoft component and\na hardening of the X-ray continuum. This GBHC analogy has also been proposed\nfor NLS1s. Alternatively, the variability may be caused by opacity changes in a\nhot, optically-thin corona which surrounds a cold, dense accretion disc; this\nwas first suggested by Guainazzi et al. for 1H0419-577, an object which shows\nremarkably similar properties to RE J2248-511.",

F stars are of particular interest\nbecause the rest-frame near-UV spectra of the oldest known elliptical galaxies\nat z > 1 appear to be dominated by F stars near to the main-sequence turnoff.\n  We find that, in the case of the F stars, where the HST ultraviolet spectra\nhave high signal:noise, model-fitting with metallicity allowed to vary as a\nfree parameter is rather successful at deriving the correct metallicity. As a\nresult, the estimated turnoff ages of these stars yielded by the model fitting\nare well constrained. Encouraged by this we have fitted these same variable-\nmetallicity models to the deep, optical spectra of the z \\simeq 1.5 mJy radio\ngalaxies 53W091 and 53W069 obtained with the Keck telescope. While the\nage-metallicity degeneracy is not so easily lifted for these galaxies, we find\nthat even when metallicity is allowed as a free parameter, the best estimates\nof their ages are still \\geq 3 Gyr, with ages younger than 2 Gyr now strongly\nexcluded. Furthermore, we find that a search of the entire parameter space of\nmetallicity and star formation history using MOPED (Heavens et al., 2000) leads\nto the same conclusion. Our results therefore continue to argue strongly\nagainst an Einstein-de Sitter universe, and favour a lambda-dominated universe\nin which star formation in at least these particular elliptical galaxies was\ncompleted somewhere in the redshift range z = 3 - 5.",

Emphasis is placed on the (Schr\\\"odinger picture) states of the\nsystem, described in terms of Slater determinants of Dirac states, and not on\nthe field operator $\\hat{\\psi}(x)$ (which is superfluous in this approach). The\nvacuum state `at time $\\tau$' is defined as the Slater determinant of a basis\nfor the span of the negative spectrum of the `first quantized' Hamiltonian\n$\\hat{H}(\\tau)$, thus providing a concrete realisation of the Dirac Sea. The\ngeneral S-matrix element of the theory is derived in terms of time-dependent\nBogoliubov coefficients, demonstrating that the S-matrix follows directly from\nthe definition of inner product between Slater determinants. The process of\n`Hermitian extension', inherited directly from conventional multiparticle\nquantum mechanics, allows second quantized operators to be defined without\nappealing to a complete set of orthonormal modes, and provides an extremely\nstraightforward derivation of the general expectation value of the theory. The\nconcept of `radar time', advocated by Bondi in his work on k-calculus, is used\nto generalise the particle interpretation to an arbitrarily moving observer.

When this condition is fulfilled the pulse still can\nshow peaks propagating with superluminal (or subluminal) velocities, but now\nits wave front travels at speed $c$. These results are important because they\nexplain several experimental results obtained in recent experiments, where\nsuperluminal velocities have been observed, without implying in any breakdown\nof the Principle of Relativity.",

    "summary": "In a previous work it was shown that the gravitational and inertial masses\nare correlated by an adimensional factor, which depends on the incident\nradiation upon the particle. It was also shown that there is a direct\ncorrelation between the radiation absorbed by the particle and its\ngravitational mass, independently of the inertial mass. This finding has\nfundamental consequences to Unified Field Theory and Quantum Cosmology. Only in\nthe absence of electromagnetic radiation the mentioned factor becomes equal to\none. On the other hand, in specific electromagnetic conditions, it can be\nreduced, nullified or made negative. This means that there is the possibility\nof the gravitational masses can be reduced, nullified and made negative by\nmeans of electromagnetic radiation. This unexpected theoretical result was\nrecently confirmed by an experiment (gr-qc/0005107). A fundamental consequence\nof the mentioned correlation is that , in specific ultra-high energy\nconditions, the gravitational and electromagnetic fields can be described by\nthe same Hamiltonian , i.e., in these circumstances, they are unified. Such\nconditions can have occurred inclusive in the Initial Universe , before the\nfirst spontaneous breaking of symmetry. Taking as base this discovery, and\nstarting from the gravitational mass of superparticles from the Initial\nUniverse we show here that it is possible to deduce the reciprocal fine\nstructure constant and the uncertainty principle directly from the Gravitation\nTheory(Unified Theory).",

In particular, we utilize results from the\nAll-Sky Monitor on RXTE, along with archival data from previous missions, to\nassess the mean integrated output of X-rays in the 2-10 keV band from accreting\nearly-type binaries within 3 kpc of the Sun. Using a recent OB star census of\nthe Solar neighborhood, we then calculate the specific X-ray luminosity per O\nstar from accretion-powered systems. We also assess the contribution to the\ntotal X-ray luminosity of an OB population from associated T Tauri stars,\nstellar winds, and supernovae. We repeat this exercise for the major Local\nGroup galaxies, concluding that the total X-ray luminosity per O star spans a\nbroad range from 2 to 20e34 erg/s. Contrary to previous results, we do not find\na consistent trend with metallicity; in fact, the specific luminosities for M31\nand the SMC are equal, despite having metallicities which differ by an order of\nmagnitude. In light of these results, we assess the fraction of the observed\n2-10 keV emission from starburst galaxies that arises directly from their OB\nstar populations, concluding that, while binaries can explain most of the hard\nX-ray emission in many local starbursts, a significant additional component or\ncomponents must be present in some systems.

The empirical\nSchmidt law of star formation rates, and closed box model of chemical evolution\nthat an approximation known as instantaneous recycling is assumed, are adopted.\nIn our models, when the predicted distribution of metallicity for DLAs is\ncalculated, two cases are considered. One is that, using the closed box model,\nempirical Schmidt law and star formation time, the distribution of metallicity\ncan be directly calculated. The other is that, when the simple gravitational\ninstability of a thin isothermal gas disc as first discussed by Toomre is\nconsidered, the star formation occurs only in the region where the surface\ndensity of gas satisfies the critical value, not everywhere of a gas disc. We\nassume that star formation in each DLA lasts for a period of 1 Gyr from\nredshifts $z=3$. There is only one output parameter in our models, i.e. the\nstellar yield, which relates to the time of star formation history and is\nobtained by normalizing the predicted distribution of metallicity to the mean\nvalue of 1/13 $Z_{\\odot}$ as presented by Pettini et al.

The $p_T$ and invariant-mass distributions are presented\nto study the dependence of the RS model parameters. The production of\nlongitudinally polarized Z bosons, to which the SM contributions are\nsuppressed, is mainly due to KK gravitons and the radion, providing one of the\nmost robust methods to signal the RS effects.

Here we evaluate such Bloch-Nordsieck\nviolating corrections in the case of initial longitudinal bosons, which is\nexperimentally provided by boson fusion processes, and is related to the\nGoldstone-Higgs sector. All four states of this sector are involved in the\ngroup structure of the corrections, and cause in particular a novel double log\neffect due to hypercharge mixing in the longitudinal states. We study both the\nlight- and the heavy-Higgs cases, and we analyze the symmetry breaking pattern\nof the corrections. The latter turn out to be pretty large, in the 5-10 %\nrange, and show an interesting Higgs mass dependence, even for processes\nwithout Higgs boson in the final state.",

From a global\nanalysis of the rate and spectrum data, this scenario is allowed at only 14%\nprobability with the observed Cl rate. If we allow for a 20% upward\nrenormalisation of the Cl rate along with a downward renormalisation of the $B$\nneutrino flux then the fit improves considerably to a probability of $\\sim\n50%$. We compare the quality of these fits with those of the MSW solutions.\nThese renormalisations are also found to improve the quality of the fits with\nMSW solutions and enlarge the allowed region of their validity in the parameter\nspace substantially. Over much of this enlarged region the matter effects on\nthe suppression of the solar neutrino flux are found to be very weak, so that\nthe solutions become practically energy independent.",

We show that the physics of early\nuniverse, particularly inflation, is governed by the Brans-Dicke theory. The\nBrans-Dicke scalar, however, quickly settles to its equilibrium value and\ndecouples from the post-inflationary cosmology. The deceleration parameter is\nnegative to start with but changes sign before the Brans-Dicke scalar settles\nto its equilibrium value. Consequently, the brane metric smoothly exits\ninflation. We have also studied the slow-roll inflation in our model and\ninvestigated the spectra of the density perturbation generated by the radion\nfield and find them consistent with the current observations.",

Current predictions are based on several sequences of\nnonlinear, convective pulsation models at solar chemical composition (Y=0.28,\nZ=0.02) and stellar masses ranging from 3.0 to 5.5 Mo. The comparison between\npredicted and empirical radii of four short-period Galactic Cepheids suggests\nthat QZ Nor and EV Sct are pulsating in the fundamental mode, whereas Polaris\nand SZ Tau pulsate in the first overtone. This finding supports the mode\nidentifications that rely on the comparison between direct and\nPeriod-Luminosity (PL) based distance determinations but it is somewhat at\nvariance with the mode identification based on Fourier parameters. In fact, we\nfind from our models that fundamental and first overtone pulsators attain, for\nperiods ranging from 2.7 to 4 d, quite similar phi_21 values, making mode\ndiscrimination from this parameter difficult. The present mode identifications\nfor our sample of Cepheids are strengthened by the accuracy of their empirical\nradius estimates, as well as by the evidence that predicted fundamental and\nfirst overtone radii do not show, within the current uncertainty on the\nMass-Luminosity (ML) relation, any degeneracy in the same period range.\nAccurate radius determinations are therefore an excellent tool to unambiguously\ndetermine the pulsation modes of short-period Cepheids.",

Many local,\nsingle-particle, thermodynamical and response properties have been studied as\nfunctions of the external parameters and compared between the two models and\nwith some numerical and exact results. It has been shown that the 2-site\nHubbard model already contains the most relevant energy scales of the Hubbard\nmodel: the local Coulomb interaction $U$ and the spin-exchange one\n$J=\\frac{4t^2}U$. As a consequence of this, for some relevant properties\n(kinetic energy, double occupancy, energy, specific heat and entropy) and as\nregards the metal-insulator transition issue, it has resulted possible to\nalmost exactly mime the behavior of larger systems, sometimes using a higher\ntemperature to get a comparable level spacing.

The law implies that the\nsurvivability changes with environment via phase transitions, which are\nsimultaneous for all generations.

The existence of a\nmultiple image system with known redshift allows, for a given (Omega_m,\nOmega_lambda) cosmology, absolute calibration of the total mass deduced from\nlens modelling. Recent Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of galaxy\nclusters reveal a large number of multiple images, which are predicted to be at\ndifferent redshifts. If it is possible to measure spectroscopically the\nredshifts of many multiple images then one can in principle constrain\n(Omega_m,Omega_lambda) through ratios of angular diameter distances,\nindependently of any external assumptions. For a regular/relaxed cluster\nobserved by HST with 3 multiple image systems, each with different\nspectroscopic redshifts, we show by analytic calculation that the following\nuncertainties can be expected: Omega_m=0.30 +/- 0.11, Omega_lambda=0.70 +/-\n0.23 or Omega_m=1.00 +/- 0.17, Omega_lambda=0.00 +/- 0.48 for the two most\npopular world models. Numerical tests on simulated data confirm these good\nconstraints, even in the case of more realistic cluster potentials, such as\nbimodal clusters, or when including perturbations by galaxies. To investigate\nthe sensitivity of the method to different mass profiles, we also use an\nanalytic ``pseudo-elliptical'' Navarro, Frenk & White profile in the\nsimulations. These constraints can be improved if more than 3 multiple images\nwith spectroscopic redshifts are observed, or by combining the results from\ndifferent clusters.

Also the [Fe/H] obtained\nfrom Fe I and Fe II lines is constant within the rather small uncertainties for\nthis group of stars over the full range in Teff and luminosity, suggesting that\nNLTE effects are negligible in our iron abundance determination. In this\nglobular cluster, there is no difference among the mean [Fe/H] of giant stars\nlocated at or above the RHB, RHB stars, giant stars located below the RHB and\nstars near the turnoff.",

Even though this morphology\nevolution problem has attracted considerable attention, the physics responsible\nfor porosity evolution have remained a mystery . Here we show by experiment,\nlattice computer simulation, and a continuum model, that nanoporosity is due to\nan intrinsic dynamical pattern formation process - pores form because the more\nnoble atoms are chemically driven to aggregate into two-dimensional clusters\nvia a spinodal decomposition process at the solid-electrolyte interface. At the\nsame time, the surface area continuously increases due to etching. Together,\nthese processes evolve a characteristic length scale predicted by our continuum\nmodel. The applications potential of nanoporous metals is enormous. For\ninstance, the high surface area of nanoporous gold made by dealloying Ag-Au can\nbe chemically tailored, making it suitable for sensor applications,\nparticularly in biomaterials contexts.",

In addition to the halo and at a\nmuch lower level, outlying steep-spectrum emission regions straddle the cluster\ncenter and are seen only at 74 MHz. The location, morphology and spectrum of\nthis emission are all highly suggestive of at least one, and possibly two\ncluster radio relics. Easily obtained higher resolution, higher sensitivity VLA\nobservations at both frequencies are required to confirm the extended nature of\nthe halo-like emission and the 74 MHz relic detections.

The timestep shortens by\na factor two with each successive refinement. It is argued that an appropriate\nchoice of softening length is of great importance and that the softening should\nbe at all points an appropriate multiple of the local inter-particle\nseparation. Unlike tree and P3M codes, multigrid codes automatically satisfy\nthis requirement. We show that at early times and low densities in cosmological\nsimulations, the softening needs to be significantly smaller relative to the\ninter-particle separation than in virialized regions. Tests of the ability of\nthe code's Poisson solver to recover the gravitational fields of both\nvirialized halos and Zel'dovich waves are presented, as are tests of the code's\nability to reproduce analytic solutions for plane-wave evolution.

The broad wavelength\ncoverage enables us to more accurately identify and determine the properties of\nboth oxygen- and carbon-rich circumstellar dust. A simple model fit was made to\ndetermine the abundance and typical temperature of the amorphous silicates,\nenstatite and forsterite. Forsterite and enstatite do have roughly the same\nabundance and temperature. The origin and location of the dust in a toroidal\ndisk around the central star are discussed.",

The scattering would suppress the\noriginal anisotropies, but will generate strong new anisotropies in the CMB\ntemperature and polarization on sub-degree scales (l>100). Observations at\ndifferent wavelengths in this spectral regime can probe different thin slices\nof the early universe. The anisotropy noise contributed by continuum radiation\nfrom foreground far--infrared sources could be taken out by subtracting maps at\nslightly different wavelengths.

A detailed investigation of\nthese deviations is undertaken by applying a Fourier analysis of the azimuthal\ndistributions of the line-of-sight velocities at different distances from the\ngalactic center. As a result of the analysis, all the main parameters of the\nwave spiral pattern are determined: the corotation radius, the amplitudes and\nphases of the gas velocity perturbations at different radii, and the velocity\nof circular rotation of the disk corrected for the velocity perturbations due\nto spiral arms. At a high confidence level, the presence of the two giant\nanticyclones in the reference frame rotating with the spiral pattern is shown;\ntheir sizes and the localization of their centers are consistent with the\nresults of the analytic theory and of numerical simulations. Besides the\nanticyclones, the existence of cyclones in residual velocity fields of spiral\ngalaxies is predicted. In the reference frame rotating with the spiral pattern\nthese cyclones have to reveal themselves in galaxies where a radial gradient of\nazimuthal residual velocity is steeper than that of the rotation velocity\n(abridged).",

This assumption fails if the pressure is lowered enough to increase\nthe relaxation times over the length of light pulses; the ''Impulsive\nStimulated Raman Scattering'' (ISRS), generally used to study dense matter with\nultrashort laser pulses, is adapted to the low energy pulses making the\nincoherent light beams; the usual light is redshifted by some very low pressure\ngases while it propagates.\n  To produce this adapted ISRS called ''Incoherent Light Spatially Coherent\nRaman Scattering\" (ILSCRS), a molecule must have an hyperfine structure:\npolyatomic molecules must be heavy or have odd numbers of electrons; light\natoms and the other molecules must be perturbed by a Stark or Zeeman effect.\n  ILSCRS redshifts may be distinguished from Doppler redshifts using a very\ndifficult to observe dispersion of ILSCRS redshifts.

At the bottom of this hierarchy are the partial density of states for\nwhich represent the contribution to the local density of states if both the\nincident and outgoing scattering channel are prescribed. On the next higher\nlevel is the injectivity which represents the contribution to the local density\nof states if only the incident channel is prescribed regardless of the final\nscattering channel. The injectivity is related by reciprocity to the emissivity\nof a point into a quantum channel. The sum of all partial density of states or\nthe sum of all injectivities or the sum of all emissivities is equal to the\nlocal density of states. The use of the partial density of states is\nillustrated for a number of different electron transport problems in mesoscopic\nphysics: The transmission from a tunneling tip into a mesoscopic conductor, the\ndiscussion of inelastic or phase breaking scattering with a voltage probe, and\nthe ac-conductance of mesoscopic conductors. The transition from a capacitive\nresponse (positive time-delay) to an inductive response (negative time-delay)\nfor a quantum point contact is used to illustrate the difficulty in associating\ntime-scales with a linear response analysis. A brief discussion of the\noff-diagonal elements of a partial density of states matrix is presented. The\noff-diagonal elements permit to investigate carrier fluctuations away from the\naverage carrier density.

The question arises whether any braking mechanism could act in a way\nthat long recurrence times are favored.

The\ndata were collected by the balloon-borne experiment CAPRICE98 which was flown\non 28-29 May 1998 from Fort Sumner, New Mexico, USA. The experiment used the\nNMSU-WIZARD/CAPRICE98 balloon-borne magnet spectrometer equipped with a gas\nRing Imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detector, a time-of-flight system, a tracking\ndevice consisting of drift chambers and a superconducting magnet and a\nsilicon-tungsten calorimeter. The RICH detector was the first ever flown\ncapable of mass-resolving charge-one particles at energies above 5 GeV.\n  A total of 31 antiprotons with rigidities between 4 and 50 GV at the\nspectrometer were identified with small backgrounds from other particles. The\nabsolute antiproton energy spectrum was determined in the kinetic energy region\nat the top of the atmosphere between 3.2 and 49.1 GeV. We found that the\nobserved antiproton spectrum and the antiproton-to-proton ratio are consistent\nwith a pure secondary origin. However, a primary component may not be excluded.",

For $n=3$ generations, we extend to the Yukawa matrices of $u$- and\n$d$-type quarks the property that the $2\\times 2$ upper-left sub-matrix of the\nCabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix $K$ is a good approximation to the Cabibbo\nmatrix $C$. Then, without any additional Ansatz concerning the existence of\nmass hierarchies or the smallness of the mixing angles, the moduli of its\nentries $K_{13},K_{23},K_{31},K_{32}$ are shown to scale like\n$[\\beta_{13},\\beta_{23},\\beta_{31},\\beta_{32}] \\sqrt{{m_c}/{m_t}} \\pm\n[\\delta_{13},\\delta_{23},\\delta_{31},\\delta_{32}] \\sqrt{{m_s}/{m_b}}$, where\nthe $\\beta$'s and the $\\delta$'s are coefficients smaller than 10.

    "summary": "Over the past decade, microlensing has developed into a powerful tool to\nstudy stellar astrophysics, especially stellar atmospheres, stellar masses, and\nbinarity. I review this progress. Stellar atmospheres can be probed whenever\nthe source in a microlensing event passes over the caustic (contour of infinite\nmagnification) induced by the lens because the caustic effectively resolves the\nsource. Broad-band observations of four events have yielded limb-darkening\nmeasurements, which in essence map the atmospheric temperature as a function of\ndepth. And now, for the first time, spectroscopic observations of one event\npromise much richer diagnostics of the source atmosphere. In the past two\nyears, a practical method has finally been developed to systematically measure\nthe lens masses in microlensing events. This will permit a census of all\nmassive objects, both dark and luminous, in the Galactic bulge, including\nlow-mass stars, brown dwarfs, white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. The\nmethod combines traditional ground-based photometry with astrometric and\nphotometric measurements by the Space Interferometry Mission (SIM) in solar\norbit. Using a related technique SIM can also obtain accurate (>~ 1%) mass\nmeasurement of a dozen or so nearby stars, thus enabling precision tests of\nstellar models. Binary lenses can give rise to dramatic and easily detectable\nmicrolensing signatures, even for large mass ratios. This makes microlensing a\npotentially powerful probe of the companion mass distribution, especially in\nthe Galactic bulge where this function is difficult to probe by other\ntechniques.",

Since the properties of the D0 decays are\ncrucial to these methods, it is possible that D0-D0-bar mixing at the 1% level\nwill contaminate the results.

    "summary": "The recent discovery of a ~9.5-d period in the X-ray lightcurve of the\nmassive X-ray binary 4U2206+54 has opened the possibility that it is a Be/X-ray\nbinary with an unusually close orbit, which, together with its low intrinsic\nluminosity, suggests that the system is actually a Be + WD binary, in which a\nwhite dwarf accretes material from the dense circumstellar disc surrounding a\nclassical Be star. In this paper we present new X-ray observations and for the\nfirst time high-resolution optical spectroscopy of the source. We show that\nboth the X-ray behaviour and the characteristics of the optical counterpart, BD\n+53 2790, are more consistent with a neutron star accreting from the wind of an\nearly-type star. The X-ray lightcurve shows irregular flaring and no\nindications of pulsations, while the very high hydrogen column density supports\naccretion from a dense wind. BD +53 2790 is shown not to be a classical Be\nstar, as believed until now, but rather a very peculiar late O-type active\nstar, exhibiting emission components in the HeII lines, complex spectral\nvariability and strong wind resonance lines in the ultraviolet. Though many of\nthe characteristics of the spectrum resemble those of the He-rich stars, the\nabsence of HeI variability makes a connection unlikely. The spectrum is\ncompatible with a composite of two stars of similar spectral type, though\ncircumstantial evidence points to a single very peculiar active early-type\nstar. This adds weight to the growing evidence that the traditional\nsubdivisions of supergiant and Be/X-ray binaries fail to cover the whole\nphenomenology of massive X-ray binaries.",

We establish asymptotic completeness of\nRayleigh scattering for a class of model Hamiltonians with the features that\nthe atomic Hamiltonian has point spectrum coexisting with absolutely continuous\nspectrum, and that either an infrared cutoff is imposed on the interaction\nHamiltonian or photons are treated as massive particles.\n  We show that, for models of massless photons, the spectrum of the Hamiltonian\nstrictly below the ionization threshold is purely continuous, except for the\ngroundstate energy.",

In two spatial\ndimensions, the parameter space for k solitons is a Kahler de-singularization\nof the symmetric product (R^2)^k/S_k. We exploit the existence of this moduli\nspace to construct solitons on quotient spaces of the plane: R^2/Z_k, cylinder,\nand T^2. However, we show that tori of area less than or equal to (2 pi theta)\ndo not admit stable solitons. In four dimensions the moduli space provides an\nexplicit Kahler resolution of (R^4)^k/S_k.
