    "summary": "We report on a calculation of the growth of the mass of supermassive black\nholes at galactic centers from dark matter and Eddington - limited baryonic\naccretion. Assuming that dark matter halos are made of fermions and harbor\ncompact degenerate Fermi balls of masses from $10^{3}M_{\\odot}$ to\n$10^{6}M_{\\odot}$, we find that dark matter accretion can boost the mass of\nseed black holes from about $\\sim 5M_{\\odot}$ to $10^{3-4}M_{\\odot}$ black\nholes, which then grow by Eddington - limited baryonic accretion to\nsupermassive black holes of $10^{6 - 9}M_{\\odot}$. We then show that the\nformation of the recently detected supermassive black hole of $3\\times\n10^{9}M_{\\odot}$ at a redshift of $z = 6.41$ in the quasar SDSS\nJ114816.64+525150.3 could be understood if the black hole completely consumes\nthe degenerate Fermi ball and then grows by Eddington - limited baryonic\naccretion. In the context of this model we constrain the dark matter particle\nmasses to be within the range from 12 ${\\rm keV/c}^{2}$ to about 450 ${\\rm\nkeV/c}^{2}$. Finally we investigate the black hole growth dependence on the\nformation time of the seed BH and on the mass of the seed BH. We find that in\norder to fit the observed data point of $M_{BH} \\sim 3 \\times 10^{9}M_{\\odot}$\nand $z \\sim 6.41$, dark matter accretion cannot start later than about $2\n\\times 10^{8}$ years and the seed BH cannot be greater than about\n$10^{4}M_{\\odot}$. Our results are in full agreement with the WMAP observations\nthat indicate that the first onset of star formation might have occurred at a\nredshift of $z \\sim 15 - 20$. For other models of dark matter particle masses,\ncorresponding constraints may be derived from the growth of black holes in the\ncenter of galaxies.",

The\nMinkowski and de Sitter solutions localize gravity to the intersection, leading\nto 4D Newtonian gravity at large distances. We show this explicitly in the case\nof Minkowski origami by finding the zero-mode graviton, and computing the\ncouplings of the bulk gravitons to the matter on the intersection. In de Sitter\ncase, this follows from the finiteness of the bulk volume. The effective 4D\nPlanck scale depends on the square of the fundamental 6D Planck scale, the\n$AdS_6$ radius and the angles between the 4-branes and the radial $AdS$\ndirection, and for the Minkowski origami it is $M_4{}^2 = {2/3} \\Bigl(\\tan\n\\alpha_1 + \\tan \\alpha_2 \\Bigr) M_*{}^4 L^2$.

The electrical resistance obtained from such measurements is\nfound to be measurably altered by the presence of this single entity. To\nelucidate these observations we develop a simple model for the electrical\npotential distribution along a multiterminal device in the presence of a single\nDW. This is employed to calculate the effect of a single DW upon the\nlongitudinal and transverse resistance. The model provides very good agreement\nwith experimental observations, and serves to highlight important deviations\nfrom simple theory. We show that measurements of transverse resistance along\nthe channel permits establishing the position and the shape of the DW contained\nwithin it. An experimental scheme is developed that enables unambiguous\nextraction of the intrinsic DW resistivity. This permits the intrinsic\ncontribution to be differentiated from resistivities originating from the bulk\nand from magnetic anisotropy - effects that are generally manifested as large\nbackgrounds in the experiments.",

We identify 135 intergalactic absorption lines\nwith equivalent widths >10mA, tracing 78 absorption components in 72 Ly\nalpha/beta absorption-line systems. We concentrate on the distribution and\nphysical properties of the WHIM as sampled by OVI and intrinsically broad Ly\nalpha lines. The number of intervening OVI absorbers for equivalent widths W>24\nmA is 3-6 over an unobscured redshift path of dz=0.368. This implies a number\ndensity of OVI systems, dN/dz, of ~8-16 along this sight line. This range is\nconsistent with estimates from other sight lines, supporting the idea that\nintervening intergalactic OVI absorbers contain an substantial fraction of the\nbaryonic mass in the low-redshift Universe. We identify a number of broad Ly\nalpha absorbers with large Doppler parameters (b~40-200 km/s) and low column\ndensities (N(HI)<10^14 cm^-2). For pure thermal broadening, these widths\ncorrespond to temperatures of ~1x10^5 to 3x10^6 K. While these broad absorbers\ncould be caused by blends of multiple, unresolved lines, continuum undulations,\nor by kinematic flows and Hubble broadening, we consider the possibility that\nsome of these features are single-component, thermally broadened Ly alpha\nlines. These systems could represent WHIM absorbers that are too weak, too\nmetal-poor, and/or too hot to be detected in OVI. If so, their widths and their\nfrequency in the PG1259+593 spectrum imply that these absorbers trace an even\nlarger fraction of the baryons in the low-redshift Universe than the OVI\nabsorbing systems (abridged version).",

When g = gl(n) these\nBorel quantum function algebras are generated by the entries of a triangular\nq-matrix, thus eventually U_q(gl(n)) is generated by the entries of an upper\ntriangular and a lower triangular q-matrix, which share the same diagonal. The\nsame elements generate over the ring of Laurent polynomials the unrestricted\ninteger form of U_q(gl(n)) of De Concini and Procesi, which we present\nexplicitly, together with a neat description of the associated quantum\nFrobenius morphisms at roots of 1.

The theoretical estimate of\ncharmed and bottom pentaquark masses is quite controversial and it is not clear\nwhether the ground-state heavy pentaquark lies above or below the strong-decay\nthreshold. We study the weak transitions of heavy pentaquark states using the\nlight-front quark model. In the heavy quark limit, heavy-to-heavy pentaquark\ntransition form factors can be expressed in terms of three Isgur-Wise\nfunctions: two of them are found to be normalized to unity at zero recoil,\nwhile the third one is equal to 1/2 at the maximum momentum transfer, in\naccordance with the prediction of the large-Nc approach or the quark model.\nTherefore, the light-front model calculations are consistent with the\nrequirement of heavy quark symmetry. Numerical results for form factors and\nIsgur-Wise functions are presented. Decay rates of the weak decays Theta_b+ to\nTheta_c0 pi+ (rho+), Theta_c0 to Theta+ pi- (rho-), Sigma'_{5b}+ to\nSigma'_{5c}0 pi+ (rho+) and Sigma'_{5c}0 to N_8+ pi- (rho-) with Theta_Q,\n  Sigma'_{5Q} and N_8 being the heavy anti-sextet, heavy triplet and light\noctet pentaquarks, respectively, are obtained. For weakly decaying Theta_b+ and\nTheta_c0, the branching ratios of Theta_b+ to Theta_c0 pi+, Theta_c0 to Theta+\npi- are estimated to be at the level of 10^{-3} and a few percents,\nrespectively.",

The\nobserved relation between the deuterium fractionation and the integrated CO\ndepletion factor across the core can be reproduced by chemical models if N2H+\nis slightly (factor of ~2 in fractional abundance) depleted in the central 3000\nAU. The N2H+ and N2D+ linewidths in the core center are ~0.3 km/s,\nsignificantly larger than in other more quiescent Taurus starless cores but\nsimilar to those observed in the center of L1544. The kinematical behaviour of\nL1521F is more complex than seen in L1544, and a model of contraction due to\nambipolar diffusion is only marginally consistent with the present data. Other\nvelocity fields, perhaps produced by unresolved substructure, are present. Both\nchemical and kinematical analyses suggest that L1521F is less evolved than\nL1544, but, in analogy with L1544, it is approaching the ``critical'' state.",

The realization of the memory\nkernels are restricted due the conservation of the basic quantity $p$. A\ngeneral criteria is given for the existence of stationary solutions. In case\nthe memory kernel depends on $p$ polynomially the transport is prevented. Owing\nto the delay effects a finite amount of particles remains localized and the\nfurther transport is terminated.

One\nof the properties observed is that the magnetization shows plateaus near zero\nand near one-third of the saturation value if a magnetic field is applied along\nthe helical axis, but not if the field is applied in the plane perpendicular to\nthat axis. The system consists of a spin-1/2 chain in which cobalt ions (which\nare highly anisotropic with an easy axis e_i) and organic radicals (which are\nisotropic) alternate with each other. The easy axis of the cobalts e_i lie at\nan angle theta_i with respect to the helical axis, while the projection of\ne_{i+1} - e_i on the plane perpendicular to the helical axis is given by 2 pi\n/3. For temperatures and magnetic fields which are much smaller than the\ncoupling between the nearest-neighbor cobalts and radicals, one can integrate\nout the radicals to obtain an Ising model for the cobalts; this enables one to\ncompute the thermodynamic properties of the system using the transfer matrix\napproach. We consider a model in which the tilt angles theta_i are allowed to\nvary with i with period three; we find that for certain patterns of theta_i,\nthe system shows the magnetization plateaus mentioned above.

In this paper we develop a systematic method for\nrelating the parameter labelling the marginal boundary deformation in the\nconformal field theory to the parameter labelling the classical solution in\nopen string field theory. This is done by first constructing the\nenergy-momentum tensor associated with the classical solution in open string\nfield theory using Noether method, and then comparing this to the answer\nobtained in the conformal field theory by analysing the boundary state.

After insuring the security of the quantum channel, Alice\nencodes the secret message directly on a sequence of particle states and\ntransmits them to Bob supervised by Charlie using this controlled quantum\nteleportation. Bob can read out the encoded message directly by the measurement\non his qubit. In this scheme, the controlled quantum teleportation transmits\nAlice's message without revealing any information to a potential eavesdropper.\nBecause there is not a transmission of the qubit carrying the secret message\nbetween Alice and Bob in the public channel, it is completely secure for\ncontrolled and direct secret communication if perfect quantum channel is used.\nThe feature of this scheme is that the communication between two sides depends\non the agreement of the third side.",

The X-ray temperature is\nfound to be 11.5{+1.1}{-0.9}keV, the highest X-ray temperature of any cluster\nat z>0.6. In contrast to MS1054-0321, the only other very hot cluster currently\nknown at z>0.8, ClJ1226.9+3332 features a relaxed X-ray morphology, and its\nhigh overall gas temperature is not caused by one or several hot spots. The\nsystem thus constitutes a unique example of a high redshift, high temperature,\nrelaxed cluster, for which the usual hydrostatic equilibrium assumption, and\nthe X-ray mass is most reliable. A temperature profile is constructed (for the\nfirst time at this redshift) and is consistent with the cluster being\nisothermal out to 45% of the virial radius. Within the virial radius\n(corresponding to a measured overdensity of a factor of 200), a total mass of\n(1.4+/-0.5)*10^15 M_solar is derived, with a gas mass fraction of 12+/-5%. The\nbolometric X-ray luminosity is (5.3+/-0.2)*10^45 erg/s. The probabilities of\nfinding a cluster of this mass within the volume of the discovery X-ray survey\nare 8*10^{-5} for Omega_M=1 and 0.64 for Omega_M=0.3, making Omega_M=1 highly\nunlikely. The entropy profile suggests that entropy evolution is being\nobserved. The metal abundance (of Z=0.33{+0.14}{-0.10} Z_solar), gas mass\nfraction, and gas distribution are consistent with those of local clusters;\nthus the bulk of the metals were in place by z=0.89.",

In type II see-saw mechanism with dominance of the\nnon-canonical SU(2)_L triplet term, the conventional see-saw term can give a\nsmall contribution to the neutrino mass matrix. If the triplet term corresponds\nto the bimaximal mixing scheme in the normal hierarchy, the small contribution\nof the conventional see-saw term naturally generates non-maximal solar neutrino\nmixing. Atmospheric neutrino mixing is also reduced from maximal, corresponding\nto 1 - \\sin^2 2 \\theta_{23} of order 0.01. Also, small but non-vanishing U_{e3}\nof order 0.001 is obtained. It is also possible that the \\Delta m^2 responsible\nfor solar neutrino oscillations is induced by the small conventional see-saw\nterm. Larger deviations from zero U_{e3} and from maximal atmospheric neutrino\nmixing are then expected. This scenario links the small ratio of the solar and\natmospheric \\Delta m^2 with the deviation from maximal solar neutrino mixing.\nWe comment on leptogenesis in this scenario and compare the contributions to\nthe decay asymmetry of the heavy Majorana neutrinos as induced by themselves\nand by the triplet.",

At\nthe onset of the first outburst, the source was found in a spectrally low/hard\nstate lasting for ~40 days, followed by a three day long transition to the\nhigh/soft state. The source flux (in 2$-$10 keV) reached $\\sim$100 mCrab on\n2002 April 6, then decayed rapidly. In power spectra, we detect strong\nband-limited noise and varying low-frequency quasi periodic oscillations that\nevolved from ~0.5 Hz to ~5 Hz during the initial low/hard state of the source.\nWe find that the second outburst closely resembled the spectral evolution of\nthe first. The X-ray transient's overall outburst characteristics lead us to\nclassify XTE J1908+094 as a black-hole candidate. Here we also derive precise\nX-ray position of the source using Chandra observations which were performed\nduring the decay phase of the first outburst and following the second outburst.",

The existence of such\nboundary terms depend on the exact boundary conditions one takes. We will check\ntwo possible boundary conditions i.e. fixed bolt metric and fixed surface\ngravity. In the case of fixed metric the the action acquires a boundary term\nassociated to the bifurcation but this is canceled in the Legendre\ntransformation and so absent in the canonical generator and so in this case the\npossibility of a nontrivial central extension is ruled out.

In particular the experimentally observed strong\nrenormalization of the in-plane oxygen bond-stretching modes (OBSM) which\nappear upon doping in the HTSC's is discussed. It is shown that the\ncharacteristic softening, indicating a strong EPI, is most likely a generic\neffect of the CuO plane and is driven by a nonlocal coupling of the displaced\nions to the localized charge-fluctuations (CF's) at the Cu and O ions. The\ndifferent behaviour of the OBSM during the insulator-metal transition via the\nunderdoped phase is calculated and from a comparison of these modes conclusions\nabout the electronic state in the HTSC's are drawn. The underdoped state is\nmodelled in terms of a charge response which is insulator-like at the Cu and is\ncompeting with a metallic charge response at the O-network in the CuO plane.\nFor the non-cuprate HTSC Ba-Bi-O also a strong renormalization of the OBSM is\npredicted. C-axis polarized infrared and Raman-active modes of the HTSC's are\ncalculated in terms of CF's and anisotropic dipole-fluctuations and the problem\nof a metallic character of the BiO planes is studied.Interlayer phonons and\ntheir accompanying charge response are investigated. Depending on the\ninterlayer coupling calculations are performed from the static, adiabatic- to\nthe non-adiabatic regime.It is shown that phonon-plasmon mixing and a strong\nlong-ranged non-adiabatic EPI becomes evident within a certain region around\nthe c-axis.

The red clump of core helium burning stars is\nalso discernable near the limit of our CMD. The I-band apparent magnitude of\nthe red giant branch tip implies a distance modulus of (m-M)_I = 24.77 +/-\n0.06, which combined with an adopted reddening of E(V-I)=0.06 +/- 0.02 yields\nan absolute modulus of (m-M)_0 = 24.69 +/- 0.07 (867 +/- 28 kpc) for M33. Over\nthe range of deprojected radii covered by our field (~8.5 to ~12.5 kpc), we\nfind a significant age gradient with an upper limit of ~1 Gyr (~0.25 Gyr/kpc).\nComparison of the RGB photometry to empirical giant branch sequences for\nGalactic globulars allows us to use the dereddened color of these stars to\nconstruct a metallicity distribution function (MDF). The primary peak in the\nMDF is at a metallicity of [Fe/H] ~ -1.0 with a tail to lower abundances. The\npeak does show radial variation with a slope of d[Fe/H]/dR_{deproj} = -0.06 +/-\n0.01 dex/kpc. This gradient is consistent with the variation seen in the inner\ndisk regions of M33.

Besides, over this phase, weak magnetism\nincreases antineutrino ($\\bar{\\nu}$) mean free paths, and thus its luminosity.\nBecause the oscillation feeds mass-energy into the target $\\nu$ species, the\nlarge mass-squared difference between species ($\\nu_a \\to \\nu_s$) implies a\nhuge amount of energy to be given off as gravitational waves ($L_{\\textrm{GWs}}\n\\sim 10^{49}$ erg s$^{-1}$), due to anisotropic but coherent $\\nu$ flow over\nthe oscillation length. This asymmetric $\\nu$-flux is driven by both the\nspin-magnetic and the {\\it universal spin-rotation} coupling. The novel\ncontribution of this paper stems from 1) the new computation of the anisotropy\nparameter $\\alpha \\sim 0.1-0.01$, and 2) the use of the tight constraints from\nneutrino experiments as SNO and KamLAND, and the cosmic probe WMAP, to compute\nthe gravitational-wave emission during neutrino oscillations in supernovae core\ncollapse and bounce. We show that the mass of the sterile neutrino $\\nu_s$ that\ncan be resonantly produced during the flavor conversions makes it a good\ncandidate for dark matter as suggested by Fuller et {\\it al.} (2003). The new\nspacetime strain thus estimated is still several orders of magnitude larger\nthan those from $\\nu$ difussion (convection and cooling) or quadrupole moments\nof neutron star matter. This new feature turns these bursts the more promissing\nsupernova gravitational-wave signal that may be detected by observatories as\nLIGO, VIRGO, etc., for distances far out to the VIRGO cluster of galaxies.",

Our main findings are\nthat: 1) $C({\\rm H}\\beta)$ is linked with the galaxy spectral type and colour,\ndecreasing from early- to late-type spirals. 2) $C({\\rm H}\\beta)$ increases\nwith increasing metallicity. 3) $C({\\rm H}\\beta)$ is larger in galaxies with an\nolder stellar population. 4) $C({\\rm H}\\beta)$ is larger for more luminous\ngalaxies. 5) The extinction of the stellar light is correlated with both the\nextinction of the nebular light and the intrinsic galaxy colours. We propose\nphenomenological interpretations of our empirical results. We have also\ncross-correlated our sample of SDSS galaxies with the IRAS data base. Due to\nthe lower redshift limit imposed to our sample and to the detection limit of\nIRAS, such a procedure selected only luminous infrared galaxies. We found that\ncorrelations that were shown by other authors to occur between optical and\ninfrared properties of galaxies disappear when restricting the sample to\nluminous infrared galaxies. We also found that the optical properties of the\nluminous infrared galaxies in our SDSS sample are very similar to those of our\nentire sample of SDSS galaxies. This may be explained by the IRAS luminosity of\nthe galaxies originating in the regions that formed massive stars less than 1\nMyr ago, while the opacity of galaxies as derived from the \\Ha/\\Hb emission\nline ratio is due to diffuse dust.\n  We show some implications of our empirical results on the determination of\nglobal star formation rates and total stellar masses in normal galaxies.",

The primary goal of GoM analysis is to derive\nproperties of individuals based on results of multivariate measurements; such\nproperties are given in the form of the expectations of a hidden random\nvariable (state of an individual) conditional on the result of observations.\n  In this article, we present a new perspective for the GoM model, based on\nconsidering distribution laws of observed random variables as realizations of\nanother random variable. It happens that some moments of this new random\nvariable are directly estimable from observations. Our approach allows us to\nestablish a number of important relations between estimable moments and values\nof interest, which, in turn, provides a basis for a new numerical procedure.",

The model explains the\nacceleration of the universe at the same level of accuracy as the Lambda-CDM\nmodel.

Our method describes the buildup of the stellar\ncomponent through infall of gas and allows for gas and metal outflows. In this\nframework, we keep a minimum number of constraints and we search a large volume\nof parameter space, looking for the models which best reproduce the photometric\nobservations in the observed redshift range (0.5<z<1). We find the star\nformation efficiency to correlate well with vMAX so that massive disks are more\nefficient in the formation of stars and have a smaller spread in stellar ages.\nThis trend presents a break at around vMAX 140km/s. Galaxies on either side of\nthis threshold have significantly different age distributions. This break has\nbeen already suggested by several authors in connection with the contribution\nfrom either gravitational instabilities or supernova-driven turbulence to star\nformation. No clear trend is seen between galaxy mass and infall timescale or\ngas outflows. The model presented in this paper suggests massive disks have\nformation histories resembling those of early-type galaxies, with highly\nefficient and short-lived bursts, in contrast with low-mass disks, which have a\nmore extended star formation history. One option to explain the observed\nshallow slope of the Tully-Fisher relation at intermediate redshift could be\nsmall episodes of star formation in low-mass disks.",

This is a\npuzzle because AdS(3) string theory formally reduces to pure Chern-Simons\ntheory at long distances. We study this puzzle in the context of massive\nChern-Simons theory. We show that the puzzle is resolved in this context by the\nappearance of a chiral \"spectator boson\" in the boundary CFT which restores\nmodular invariance. It couples to the conformal metric but not to the gauge\nfield on the boundary. Consequently, we find a generalization of the standard\nChern-Simons/RCFT correspondence involving \"nonholomorphic conformal blocks\"\nand nonrational boundary CFTs. These generalizations appear in the\nlong-distance limit of AdS(3) string theory, where the role of the spectator\nboson is played by other degrees of freedom in the theory.",

Using Kwiat et al.'s interferometer, we\nconstruct a two-qubit quantum gate that changes one particle's trajectory\naccording to whether or not the other particle exists in the interferometer. We\npropose a method for distinguishing Bell-basis vectors, each of which consists\nof a pair of an electron and a positron, by this gate. (This is called the\nBell-basis measurement.) This method succeeds with probability 1 in the limit\nof $N \\to \\infty$, where N is the number of beam splitters in the\ninterferometer. Moreover, we can carry out a controlled-NOT gate operation by\nthe above Bell-basis measurement and the method proposed by Gottesman and\nChuang. Therefore, we can prepare a universal set of quantum gates by the IFM.\nThis means that we can execute any quantum algorithm by the IFM.",

Moreover, axial symmetry of the disk intrinsic\nemissivity is not assumed, although it can be imposed to speed up the\ncomputations. The new routines can be used also as a stand-alone and flexible\ncode with the capability of handling time-resolved spectra in the regime of\nstrong gravity.

However, equally good fits can be obtained also for small values of\nthe black hole angular momentum. The code has been developed with the aim of\nallowing precise modelling of relativistic effects.

We show that the FDF I-band selection down to I(AB)=26.8\nmisses of the order of 10 % of the galaxies that would be detected in a K-band\nselected survey with magnitude limit K(AB)=26.3 (like FIRES). Photometric\nredshifts for 5558 galaxies are estimated based on the photometry in 9 filters\n(U, B, Gunn g, R, I, SDSS z, J, K and a special filter centered at 834 nm). A\ncomparison with 362 spectroscopic redshifts shows that the achieved accuracy of\nthe photometric redshifts is (Delta z / (z_spec+1)) < 0.03 with only ~ 1 %\noutliers. This allows us to derive luminosity functions with a reliability\nsimilar to spectroscopic surveys. In addition, the luminosity functions can be\ntraced to objects of lower luminosity which generally are not accessible to\nspectroscopy. We investigate the evolution of the luminosity functions\nevaluated in the restframe UV (1500 Angstroem and 2800 Angstroem), u', B, and\ng' bands. Comparison with results from the literature shows the reliability of\nthe derived luminosity functions. Out to redshifts of z ~ 2.5 the data are\nconsistent with a slope of the luminosity function approximately constant with\nredshift, at a value of -1.07 +- 0.04 in the UV (1500 Angstroem, 2800\nAngstroem) as well as u', and -1.25 +- 0.03 in the blue (g', B). We do not see\nevidence for a very steep slope (alpha < -1.6) in the UV at z ~ 3.0 and z ~ 4.0\nfavoured by other authors. There may be a tendency for the faint-end slope to\nbecome shallower with increasing redshift but the effect is marginal. We find a\nbrightening of M_star and a decrease of Phi_star with redshift for all analyzed\nwavelengths. [abridged]",

Ancient\nwhite dwarfs are generally considered the most plausible candidates for such\nMACHOs. We report the results of a search for such white dwarfs in a proper\nmotion survey covering a 0.16 sqd field at three epochs at high galactic\nlatitude, and 0.938 sqd at two epochs at intermediate galactic latitude (VIRMOS\nsurvey), using the CFH telescope. Both surveys are complete to I = 23, with\ndetection efficiency fading to 0 at I = 24.2. Proper motion data are suitable\nto separate unambiguously halo white dwarfs identified by belonging to a non\nrotating system. No candidates were found within the colour-magnitude-proper\nmotion volume where such objects can be safely discriminated from any standard\npopulation as well as from possible artefacts. In the same volume, we estimate\nthe maximum white dwarf halo fraction compatible with this observation at\ndifferent significance levels if the halo is at least 14 gigayears old and\nunder different ad hoc initial mass functions. Our data alone rules out a halo\nfraction greater than 14% at 95% confidence level. Combined with two previous\ninvestigations exploring comparable volumes pushes the limit below 4 % (95%\nconfidence level) or below 1.3% (64% confidence), this implies that if baryonic\ndark matter is present in galaxy halos, it is not, or it is only marginally in\nthe form of faint hydrogen white dwarfs.",

The gas emitting the Balmer\nline radiation is located at the rear of the shock wave in the hydrogen\nrecombination zone where the gas flow velocity in the frame of the observer is\napproximately one-half of the shock wave velocity. The ratio of the Doppler\nshift to the gas flow velocity of 0.7 results both from the small optical\nthickness of the shock wave in line frequencies and the anisotropy of the\nradiation field typical for the slab geometry.

Classically we observe that the field theory on the\nfuzzy space ${\\bf R}^2{\\times}{\\bf S}^2_L$ reduces to the field theory on the\nMoyal-Weyl plane ${\\bf R}^2{\\times}{\\bf R}^2_{\\theta}$ in the flattening\ncontinuum planar limits $R,L{\\longrightarrow}{\\infty}$ where\n$R^2/L^{2q}{\\simeq}{\\theta}^2/4^q$ and $q>{3/2}$ . The effective\nnoncommutativity parameter is found to be given by\n${\\theta}_{eff}^2{\\sim}2{\\theta}^2(\\frac{L}{2})^{2q-1}$ and thus it corresponds\nto a strongly noncommuting space. In the quantum theory it turns out that this\nprescription is also equivalent to a dimensional reduction of the model where\nthe noncommutative U(1) gauge theory in 4 dimensions is shown to be equivalent\nin the large $L$ limit to an ordinary $O(M)$ non-linear sigma model in 2\ndimensions where $M{\\sim}3L^2$ . The Moyal-Weyl model defined this way is also\nseen to be an ordinary renormalizable theory which can be solved exactly using\nthe method of steepest descents . More precisely we find for a fixed\nrenormalization scale $\\mu$ and a fixed renormalized coupling constant $g_r^2$\nan $O(M)-$symmetric mass, for the different components of the sigma field,\nwhich is non-zero for all values of $g_r^2$ and hence the $O(M)$ symmetry is\nnever broken in this solution . We obtain also an exact representation of the\nbeta function of the theory which agrees with the known one-loop perturbative\nresult .",

The model assumes an exponential\ndistribution, both in the radial and $z$ directions, identical for\nstar--forming regions and dust. Fits to the data are optimized by varying the\nscale height and scale length of absorbers, as well as the disk's central\noptical depth $\\tau_\\circ$, as seen face--on. The observations indicate that\ndisk central opacity increases with total luminosity. Model fits for the most\nluminous galaxies (brighter than $M-5\\log h=-21.4$ in the I band) yield\n$\\tau_\\circ \\simeq 3.5^{+4.0}_{-2.0}$, near $\\lambda=0.66$ $\\mu$m.

Within modified cumulant expansion method, we derive an\neffective Fokker-Planck equation whose stationary solutions describe a\ncharacter of ordered state. We find that fluctuation cross-correlations lead to\na symmetry breaking of the distribution function even in the case of the\nzero-dimensional system. In general case, continuous, discontinuous and\nreentrant noise induced phase transitions take place. It is appeared the\ncross-correlations play a role of bias field which can induce a chain of phase\ntransitions being different in nature. Within mean field approach, we give an\nintuitive explanation of the system behavior through an effective potential of\nthermodynamic type. This potential is written in the form of an expansion with\ncoefficients defined by temperature, intensity of spatial coupling, auto- and\ncross-correlation times and intensities of both additive and multiplicative\nnoises.",

This is the natural\ngeneralization of the Fierz-Pauli Lagrangian for massive gravity which\ncomprises mass terms for the metric and its trace. We show that the on-shell\nbosonic and fermionic fields are degenerate and have the appropriate spins: 2,\n3/2, 3/2 and 1. We then study this interacting Lagrangian using goldstone\nsuperfields. We find that a chiral multiplet of goldstones gets a kinetic term\nthrough mixing, just as the scalar goldstone does in the non-supersymmetric\ncase. This produces Planck scale (Mpl) interactions with matter and all the\ndiscontinuities and unitarity bounds associated with massive gravity. In\nparticular, the scale of strong coupling is (Mpl m^4)^1/5, where m is the\nmultiplet's mass. Next, we consider applications of massive supergravity to\ndeconstruction. We estimate various quantum effects which generate non-local\noperators in theory space. As an example, we show that the single massive\nsupergravity multiplet in a 2-site model can serve the function of an extra\ndimension in anomaly mediation.",

A SMC\ncounterpart also has the NIV stronger than OIV. Inspection of the blue spectra\nof these stars shows that the former pair have weaker N lines in all ionization\nstates (III, IV, V) present as well as lines of CIV lambda 4658, while the\nlatter three have stronger N lines and greater He/H. Space ultraviolet\nobservations of two of the N-strong stars show NV wind profiles substantially\nstronger than those of CIV, while in the N-weak stars the CIV features are\nequal to or stronger than the NV. The N-strong stars are now reclassified as\nON2 III(f*), newly defining that category. These characteristics strongly\nsuggest a larger fraction of processed material in the atmospheres of the ON2\nstars, which we confirm by modeling the optical spectra. In the context of\ncurrent models, it is in turn implied that the ON2 stars are in a more advanced\nevolutionary state than the others, and/or that they had higher initial\nrotational velocities. The recent formulation of the effects of rotation on\nmassive stellar evolution introduces an additional fundamental parameter, which\nthe CNO abundances are in principle able to constrain. We present some\nillustrative comparisons with current Geneva evolutionary models for rotating\nmassive stars. It is possible that these very hot, nitrogen-rich objects are\nproducts of homogeneous evolution. Our results will provide motivation for\nfurther physical modeling of the atmospheres and evolutionary histories of the\nmost massive hot stars.",

    "summary": "Due to the tremendous red-shift that occurs during the inflationary epoch in\nthe early universe, it has been realized that trans-Planckian physics may\nmanifest itself at energies much lower than the Planck energy. The presence of\na fundamental scale suggests that local Lorentz invariance may be violated at\nsufficiently high energies. Motivated by this possibility, recently, different\nmodels that violate Lorentz invariance locally have been used to evaluate the\ntrans-Planckian corrections to the inflationary density perturbation spectrum.\nHowever, certain astrophysical observations seem to indicate that local Lorentz\ninvariance may be preserved to extremely high energies. In such a situation, to\nstudy the trans-Planckian effects, it becomes imperative to consider models\nthat preserve local Lorentz invariance even as they contain a fundamental\nscale. In this work, we construct one such model and evaluate the resulting\nspectrum of density perturbations in the power-law inflationary scenario. While\nour model reproduces the standard spectrum on small scales, it naturally\npredicts a suppression of power on large scales. In fact, the spectrum we\nobtain has some features which are similar to the one that has recently been\nobtained from non-commutative inflation. However, we find that the amount of\nsuppression predicted by our model is far less than that is required to fit the\nobservations. We comment on the fact that, with a suitable choice of initial\nconditions, our approach can lead to corrections at the infra-red as well as at\nthe ultra-violet ends of the spectrum.",

In\nparticular, we prove that the leading infrared renormalon ambiguity in the\nSudakov exponent cancels against the one associated with the definition of the\npole mass.

It is\ninspired by the concept of anticipated synchronization between pairs of chaotic\noscillators, recently developed in the area of Dynamical Systems, and by the\nearthquake forecasting algorithms in which different pattern recognition\nfunctions are used for identifying seismic premonitory phenomena. In the new\nstrategy, copies (clones) of the original system (the master) are defined, and\nthey are driven using rules that tend to synchronize them with the master\ndynamics. The observation of definite patterns in the state of the clones is\nthe signal for connecting an alarm in the original system that efficiently\nmarks the impending occurrence of a catastrophic event. The power of this\nmethod is quantitatively illustrated by forecasting the occurrence of\ncharacteristic earthquakes in the so-called Minimalist Model.",

On the other\nhand, a known quantum state can always be cloned or deleted. However if we\nrestrict the class of allowed operations, there will arise restrictions on the\nability of cloning and deleting machines. We have shown that cloning and\ndeleting of known states is in general not possible by local operations. This\nimpossibility hints at quantum correlation in the state. We propose dual\nmeasures of quantum correlation based on the dual restrictions of no local\ncloning and no local deleting. The measures are relative entropy distances of\nthe desired states in a (generally impossible) perfect local cloning or local\ndeleting process from the best approximate state that is actually obtained by\nimperfect local cloning or deleting machines. Just like the dual measures of\nentanglement cost and distillable entanglement, the proposed measures are based\non important processes in quantum information. We discuss their properties. For\nthe case of pure states, estimations of these two measures are also provided.\nInterestingly, the entanglement of cloning for a maximally entangled state of\ntwo two-level systems is not unity.",

In particular, a value of the\nnormalization sigma_8 = 1 would imply a highly significant skewness and\nkurtosis in the wavelet coefficients at scales around 3 arcmin. Models with a\nmore moderate excess also show a non-Gaussian signal in the simulated data. We\nconclude that current data (ACBAR) should show this signature if the excess is\nto be due to the SZ effect. Otherwise, the reason for that excess should be\nexplained by some systematic effect. The significance of the non-Gaussian\nsignal depends on the cluster model but it grows with the surveyed area.\nNon-Gaussianity test performed on incoming data sets should reveal the presence\nof a cluster population even for models with moderate-low sigma_8's.",

    "summary": "How fast a satellite decays its orbit depends on how slowly its mass is lost\nby tide. Motivated by inner halo satellite remnants like the Sgr and Omega Cen,\nwe develop fully analytical models to study the orbital decay and tidal\nmassloss of satellites. The orbital decay rate is often severely overestimated\nif applying the ChandraSekhar's formula without correcting for (a) the\nevaporation and tidal loss of the satellite and (b) the contraction of\nsatellite orbits due to adiabatic growth of the host galaxy potential over the\nHubble time. As a satellite migrates inwards, the increasing halo density\naffects the dynamical friction in two opposite ways:(1) it boosts the number of\nhalo particles swept in the satellite's gravitational \"wake\", hence increasing\nthe drag on the satellite, and (2) it boosts the tide which \"peels off\" the\nsatellite, and reduces the amplitude of the wake. These competing processes can\nbe modeled analytically for a satellite with the help of an empirical formula\nfor the massloss history. The analytical model agrees with more numerical\nsimulations of tidal massloss and dynamical friction. Rapid massloss due to\nincreasing tides at ever smaller radius makes it less likely for streams or\nremnants of infalling satellites to intrude the inner halo (as the Sgr stream\nand oCen) than to stay in the outer halo (Magellanic stream), hence any\nintermediate-mass central black holes of the satellites are also likely \"hung\nup\" at large distances as well. To avoid \"hung-up\" the satellites might start\nwith (i) pericenters much smaller than the typical distances to present-day\nobserved satellites and with (ii) central density much higher than in the often\nseen finite density cores of observed satellites.",

We find a first order phase transition between\nferromagnetic regions where the spin is maximally polarized (Nagaoka\nferromagnetism) and regions with smaller magnetization (weak ferromagnetism).\nWhen taking into account the possibility of spiral states, we find that the\nlowest critical U is obtained for an ordering momentum different from zero. The\nevolution of the ordering momentum with doping is discussed. The magnetic\nexcitations (spin waves) in the antiferromagnetic insulating phase are\ncalculated from the random-phase-approximation for the spin susceptibility. We\nalso compute the spin fluctuation correction to the mean field magnetization by\nvirtual emission/absorpion of spin waves. In the large $U$ limit, the\nrenormalized magnetization agrees qualitatively with the Holstein-Primakoff\ntheory of the Heisenberg antiferromagnet, although the latter approach produces\na larger renormalization.",

The\nshroud would be a very thick Galactic disk of low luminosity objects, most\nlikely old white dwarfs, proposed to explain the optical depth seen in\nmicrolensing surveys towards the Magellanic clouds. The shroud is a simple\nalternative to the lenses being distributed in a classical, near-spherical dark\nhalo; the advantage of the shroud is that it would compose only a fraction of a\ndark halo's total mass.\n  In this paper, we argue that stars of the Galactic shroud would be detectable\nin the recent proper motion survey of Oppenheimer et al. (2001) if their\nabsolute luminosities were brighter than M_R_59F = 19.4 or approximately M_V =\n18.6. We adopt a range of simple models of the shroud's kinematics and\nmorphology, and the colours and luminosities of its white dwarfs; via\nMonte-Carlo simulations, we predict the numbers expected in the Oppenheimer et\nal. survey, which would be clearly separated from the numbers produced by white\ndwarfs of the disk, thick disk and halo.\n  The number of white dwarf detections in the proper motion survey (98) is\nfound to be well explained by the disk, thick disk and halo. With the most\nconservative kinematic and density parameters for the shroud, and an absolute\nluminosity of the white dwarfs of M_R_59F = 17.6, we find that the proper\nmotion survey would detect over 100 WDs, just from the shroud. For a M_R_59F =\n19.4 shroud, the survey would find 5 +/- 2 peculiar objects, whereas only two\nwhite dwarfs with such characteristics are found in the original data. M_R_59F\n= 19.4 corresponds to M_V = 18.6 for WDs with V - I = -1.030.",

Twisted\nmoduli can play an important role in giving a viable string realisation of\nsequestering in the limit where supersymmetry breaking comes entirely from the\ntwisted moduli. We focus on a particular string inspired version of gaugino\nmediation in which the first two families are localised at the intersection\nbetween D5-branes, whereas the third family and Higgs doublets are allowed to\nmove within the world-volume of one of the branes. The soft supersymmetry\nbreaking third family sfermion mass terms are then in general non-degenerate\nwith the first two families. We place constraints upon parameter space and\npredictions of flavour changing neutral current effects. Twisted moduli\ndomination is studied and, as well as solving the most serious part of the SUSY\nflavour problem, is shown to be highly constrained. The constraints are\nweakened by switching on gravity-mediated contributions from the dilaton and\nuntwisted T-moduli sectors. In the twisted moduli domination limit we predict a\nstop-heavy MSSM spectrum and quasi-degenerate lightest neutralino and chargino\nstates with wino-dominated mass eigenstates.",

    "summary": "This paper presents a brief review of the newly developed \\emph{Extended\nElectrodynamics}. The relativistic and non-relativistic approaches to the\nextension of Maxwell equations are considered briefly, and the further study is\ncarried out in relativistic terms in Minkowski space-time. The non-linear\nvacuum solutions are considered and fully described. It is specially pointed\nout that solitary waves with various, in fact arbitrary, spatial structure and\nphoton-like propagation properties exist. The {\\it null} character of all\nnon-linear vacuum solutions is established and extensively used further.\nCoordinate-free definitions are given to the important quantities {\\it\namplitude} and {\\it phase}. The new quantity, named {\\it scale factor}, is\nintroduced and used as a criterion for availability of rotational component of\npropagation of some of the nonlinear, i.e. nonmaxwellian, vacuum solutions. The\ngroup structure properties of the nonlinear vacuum solutions are analyzed in\nsome detail, showing explicitly the connection of the vacuum solutions with\nsome complex valued functions. Connection-curvature interpretations are given\nand a special attention is paid to the curvature interpretation of the\nintrinsic rotational (spin) properties of some of the nonlinear solutions.\nSeveral approaches to coordinate-free local description and computation of the\nintegral spin momentum are considered. Finally, a large family of nonvacuum\nspatial soliton-like solutions is explicitly written down, and a procedure to\nget (3+1) versions of the known (1+1) soliton solutions is obtained.",

The equivalent widths of He-like Fe\nK$_\\alpha$ line of polars are found to be systematically modulated at their\nspin periods in such a way that it increases at the pole-on phase. This implies\nthat the anisotropic mechanism is commonly operating among polars. On the other\nhand, those of intermediate polars are statistically consistent with being\nunmodulated with an upper limit of 1.5 times modulation. This may be due to a\ndifferent accretion manner like aurora curtain (Rosen etal 1988) so that the\nplasma becomes optically thin along the horizontal axis also for the resonance\nlines, or because of larger optical depths for Compton scattering if the\nemission regions have the same coin-like shapes as polars.",

The algebraic structures, representing the\nperturbative expansion of the S-matrix, are imposed on the operator-valued\ndistributions which are equipped with appropriate graph indices. Translation\ninvariance ensures the algebras to be analytically well-defined and graded\ntotal symmetry allows to formulate bialgebras. The algebraic results are given\nembedded in the physical framework, which covers the two recent EG versions by\nFredenhagen and Scharf that differ with respect to the concrete recursive\nimplementation of causality. Besides, the ultraviolet divergences occuring in\nFeynman's representation are mathematically reasoned.

We\nalso report on quasi-simultaneous observations at a wavelength of 3.4 mm using\nthe Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association (BIMA) array. A flare was detected\nin the X-domain with an excess 2-8 keV luminosity of about 6$\\times10^{33}$\nerg/s. A fading flare of Sgr A* with $>$2 times the interim-quiescent flux was\nalso detected at the beginning of the NIR observations, that overlapped with\nthe fading part of the X-ray flare. Compared to 8-9 hours before the NIR/X-ray\nflare we detected a marginally significant increase in the millimeter flux\ndensity of Sgr A* during measurements about 7-9 hours afterwards. We find that\nthe flaring state can be conveniently explained with a synchrotron self-Compton\nmodel involving up-scattered sub-millimeter photons from a compact source\ncomponent, possibly with modest bulk relativistic motion. The size of that\ncomponent is assumed to be of the order of a few times the Schwarzschild\nradius. The overall spectral indices $\\alpha_{NIR/X-ray}$\n($S_{\\nu}$$\\propto$$\\nu^{-\\alpha}$) of both states are quite comparable with a\nvalue of $\\sim$1.3. Since the interim-quiescent X-ray emission is spatially\nextended, the spectral index for the interim-quiescent state is probably only a\nlower limit for the compact source Sgr A*.

In the T-dualized picture, we\nobtain the potential between a D0-brane and a D8-D8bar pair using the Schwinger\nmodel and we observe that it consists of the energy carried by fundamental\nstrings created by the Hanany-Witten effect and the vacuum energy due to a\ncylinder diagram. The D0-brane is treated quantum mechanically as a particle\ntrapped in the potential, which turns out to be a system of a harmonic\noscillator.\n  As another application, we obtain a matrix theory description of QED using\nTaylor's T-duality prescription, which is actually applicable to a wide variety\nof field theories including the realistic QCD.

The limit on the index\nof a radio - X-ray correlation we find is consistent with the value of 0.7\nwhich was found for other black hole candidates in the low/hard state.\nInterestingly, the limit we find seems more consistent with a value of 1.4\nwhich was recently shown to be typical for radiatively efficient accretion flow\nmodels. We further show that when the correlation-index is the same for two\nsources one can use the differences in normalisation in the radio - X-ray flux\ncorrelation to estimate the distance towards the sources if the distance of one\nof them is accurately known (assuming black hole spin and mass and jet Lorentz\nfactor differences are unimportant or minimal). Finally, we observed a strong\nincrease in the rate of decay of the X-ray flux. Between March 23, 2003 and\nApril 19, 2003 the X-ray flux decayed with a factor ~5 whereas between April\n19, 2003 and May 13, 2003, the X-ray flux decreased by a factor ~750.

New and published\nmulti-frequency data are combined to obtain the spectral energy distributions\nof all 7 galaxies from the near-infrared to the radio (at 1.4 GHz). These SEDs\nare compared with new models, for dust enshrouded galaxies, which account for\nboth starburst and AGN components. In all 7 galaxies the starburst provides the\ndominant contribution to the infrared luminosity; in 4 sources no contribution\nfrom an AGN is required. Although AGN may contribute up to 50 percent of the\ntotal far--infrared emission, the starbursts always dominate in the radio. The\nSEDs of most of our sources are best fit with a very high optical depth of\n(>=50) at 1 micron. The scatter in the far-infrared/radio correlation, found\namong luminous IRAS sources, is due mainly to the different evolutionary status\nof their starburst components. The short time-scale of the star formation\nprocess amplifies the delay between the far-infrared and radio emission. This\nbecomes more evident at low radio frequencies (below about 1 GHz) where\nsynchrotron radiation is the dominant process. In the far-infrared (at\nwavelengths shorter than 100 micron) an additional source of scatter is\nprovided by AGN, where present. AGN may be detected in the near-infrared by the\nabsence of the knee, typical of stellar photospheres. However, near-infrared\ndata alone cannot constrain the level at which AGN contribute because the\ninterpretation of their observed properties, in this wave-band, depends\nstrongly on model parameters.",

We confirm that the\nbest diagnostics for identifying objects with accretion discs are mid-infrared\n(lambda = 3-10 micron) colours (e.g. SST IRAC bands) rather than HKL colours.",

The system consists of\na superconducting coil subjected to a constant external force and to magnetic\nfields. The coil oscillates and has induced in it a rectified electrical\ncurrent whose magnitude may reach hundreds of Ampere. The design differs from\nthat of most conventional superconductor machines since the motion is linear\n(and practically unnoticeable depending on frequency) rather than rotatory, and\nit does not involve high speeds. Furthermore, there is no need for an external\nelectrical power source for the system to start out. We also show that the\nlosses for such a system can be made extremely small for certain operational\nconditions, so that by reaching and keeping resonance the system main\napplication should be in the generation and storage of electromagnetic energy.",

The decaying X-ray\nafterglow, back extrapolated to 11 hr after the burst, had a flux of 7.9 10^-12\ncgs (2-10 keV); the brightest detected so far. No direct redshift determination\nis available yet for this GRB, but according to the empirical relationship\nbetween the peak energy in the \\nu F_\\nu spectrum and the isotropic energy\noutput, z is constrained in the range 0.9-1.5. The reconstructed optical\nafterglow light curve implies at least two breaks in the simple power-law\ndecay. This may be related to emergence of a SN, or refreshment of the external\nshock by a variation in the circumstellar medium. By comparing the backward\nextrapolation of the 2-10 keV afterglow decay it is shown that the long\nduration of the prompt emission is not related to an early onset of afterglow\nemission, but must be related to prolonged activity of the ``central engine''.",

We combine the multiple-image systems with the\nweakly-sheared background galaxies to model the total mass distribution in the\ncluster cores (R<=500kpc). These models are complemented by high-resolution\nX-ray data from Chandra and used to develop quantitative criteria to classify\nthe clusters as relaxed or unrelaxed. Formally, (30+/-20)% of the clusters form\na homogeneous sub-sample of relaxed clusters; the remaining (70+/-20)% are\nunrelaxed and are a much more diverse population. Most of the clusters\ntherefore appear to be experiencing a cluster-cluster merger, or relaxing after\nsuch an event. We also study the normalization and scatter of scaling relations\nbetween cluster mass, luminosity and temperature. The scatter in these\nrelations is dominated by the unrelaxed clusters and is typically sigma~0.4.\nMost notably, we detect 2-3 times more scatter in the mass-temperature relation\nthan theoretical simulations and models predict. The observed scatter is also\nasymmetric - the unrelaxed systems are systematically 40% hotter than the\nrelaxed clusters at 2.5 sigma significance. This structural segregation should\nbe a major concern for experiments designed to constrain cosmological\nparameters using galaxy clusters. Overall our results are consistent with a\nscenario of cluster-cluster merger induced boosts to cluster X-ray luminosities\nand temperatures. [Abridged]",

Specifically, we\nestimate lower bounds on the coupling parameter \\omega of scalar-tensor\ntheories of the Brans-Dicke type and on the Compton wavelength of the graviton\n\\lambda_g in hypothetical massive graviton theories. In these theories,\nmodifications of the gravitational radiation damping formulae or of the\npropagation of the waves translate into a change in the phase evolution of the\nobserved gravitational waveform. We obtain the bounds through the technique of\nmatched filtering, employing the LISA Sensitivity Curve Generator (SCG),\navailable online. For a neutron star inspiralling into a 10^3 M_sun black hole\nin the Virgo Cluster, in a two-year integration, we find a lower bound \\omega >\n3 * 10^5. For lower-mass black holes, the bound could be as large as 2 * 10^6.\nThe bound is independent of LISA arm length, but is inversely proportional to\nthe LISA position noise error. Lower bounds on the graviton Compton wavelength\nranging from 10^15 km to 5 * 10^16 km can be obtained from one-year\nobservations of massive binary black hole inspirals at cosmological distances\n(3 Gpc), for masses ranging from 10^4 to 10^7 M_sun. For the highest-mass\nsystems (10^7 M_sun), the bound is proportional to (LISA arm length)^{1/2} and\nto (LISA acceleration noise)^{-1/2}. For the others, the bound is independent\nof these parameters because of the dominance of white-dwarf confusion noise in\nthe relevant part of the frequency spectrum.

This paper shows that ensemble\ngeneralization error can be calculated by using two order parameters, that is,\nthe similarity between a teacher and a student, and the similarity among\nstudents. The differential equations that describe the dynamical behaviors of\nthese order parameters are derived in the case of general learning rules. The\nconcrete forms of these differential equations are derived analytically in the\ncases of three well-known rules: Hebbian learning, perceptron learning and\nAdaTron learning. Ensemble generalization errors of these three rules are\ncalculated by using the results determined by solving their differential\nequations. As a result, these three rules show different characteristics in\ntheir affinity for ensemble learning, that is ``maintaining variety among\nstudents.\" Results show that AdaTron learning is superior to the other two\nrules with respect to that affinity.",

    "summary": "The spinor representation of the Lorentz group does not accept simple\ngeneralization with the group GL(4,R) of general linear coordinate\ntransformations. The Dirac equation may be written for an arbitrary choice of a\ncoordinate system and a metric, but the covariant linear transformations of the\nfour-component Dirac spinor exist only for isometries. For usual diagonal\nMinkowski metric the isometry is the Lorentz transformation. On the other hand,\nit is possible to define the Dirac operator on the space of anti-symmetric\n(exterior) forms, and in such a case the equation is covariant for an arbitrary\ngeneral linear transformation. The space of the exterior forms is\n16-dimensional, but usual Dirac equation is defined for four-dimensional\ncomplex space of Dirac spinors. Using suggested analogy, in present paper is\ndiscussed possibility to consider the space of Dirac spinors as some\n\"subsystem\" of a bigger space, where the group GL(4,R) of general relativity\nacts in a covariant way.\n  For such purposes in this article is considered both Grassmann algebra of\ncomplex anti-symmetric forms and Clifford algebra of Dirac matrices. Both\nalgebras have same dimension as linear spaces, but different structure of\nmultiplication. The underlying sixteen-dimensional linear space also may be\nconsidered either as space of complex 4 x 4 matrices, or as space of states of\ntwo particles: the initial Dirac spinor and some auxiliary system. It is shown\nalso, that such approach is in good agreement with well known idea to consider\nDirac spinor as some ideal of Clifford algebra. Some other possible\nimplications of given model are also discussed.",

The absorption\ncross sections for arbitrary angular momentum of the scalar field are computed\nnumerically in the full range of energy by making use of the analytic\nnear-horizon and asymptotic solutions and their analytic continuations. The\nscalar mass makes an interesting effect in the low-energy absorption cross\nsection for S-wave. Unlike the massless case, the cross section decreases with\nincreasing energy in the extremely low-energy regime. As a result the\nuniversality, {\\it i.e.} low-energy cross section for S-wave is equal to the\nhorizon area, is broken in the presence of mass. If the scalar mass is larger\nthan a critical mass, the absorption cross section becomes monotonically\ndecreasing function in the entire range of energy. The Hawking emission is also\ncalculated numerically. It turns out that the Planck factor generally\nsuppresses the contribution of higher partial waves except S-wave. The scalar\nmass in general tends to reduce the emission rate.",

Our method relies on a constrained density\nfunctional theory whereby the evolution of the orientations of the spin-moments\nresults from a semi-classical Landau-Lifshitz equation. This approach is\napplied to a study of the ground state of a finite Co chain placed along a step\nedge of a Pt(111) surface. As far as the ground state spin orientation is\nconcerned we obtain excellent agreement with the experiment. Furthermore we\nobserve noncollinearity of the atom-resolved spin and orbital moments. In terms\nof magnetic force theorem calculations we also demonstrate how a reduction of\nsymmetry leads to the existence of canted magnetic states.",

It is known from meson phenomenology\nthat for given quantum numbers these spectra approximately follow linear\ntrajectories with a universal slope. These facts can be understood in terms of\nan effective string description for QCD. For light meson states the\ntrajectories deviate noticeably from the linear behavior. We investigate the\npossible corrections to the linear trajectories by matching two-point\ncorrelators of quark currents to the Operator Product Expansion (OPE). We find\nthat the allowed modifications to the linear Regge behavior must decrease\nrapidly with the principal quantum number. After fitting the lightest states in\neach channel and certain low-energy constants the whole spectrum for meson\nmasses and residues is obtained in a satisfactory agreement with phenomenology.\nWe briefly speculate on possible implications for the QCD effective string.",

Two linearly coupled harmonic\noscillators provide a simple, exactly soluble model for exploring such\ninteraction. Even the ground state of a pair of identical oscillators exhibits\neffects on the quantum nature of one oscillator, e.g., a diminution of position\nuncertainty, and an increase in momentum uncertainty and uncertainty product,\nfrom their unperturbed values. Interaction between quantum and classical\noscillators is simulated by constructing a quantum state with one oscillator\ninitially in its ground state, the other in a coherent or Glauber state. The\nsubsequent wave function for this state is calculated exactly, both for\nidentical and distinct oscillators. The reduced probability distribution for\nthe quantum oscillator, and its position and momentum expectation values and\nuncertainties, are obtained from this wave function. The oscillator acquires an\noscillation amplitude corresponding to a beating between the normal modes of\nthe system; the behavior of the position and momentum uncertainties can become\nquite complicated. For oscillators with equal unperturbed frequencies, i.e., at\nresonance, the uncertainties exhibit a time-dependent quantum squeezing which\ncan be extreme.",

The infrared colours of the 20 objects not\naffected by near neighbours are consistent with a high redshift interpretation.\nThis suggests that the low redshift contamination of this i'-drop sample is\nsmaller than that observed at brighter magnitudes where values of 10-40% have\nbeen reported. The J-H colours are consistent with a slope flat in f_nu (f_lam\n\\propto lam^{-2}), as would be expected for an unreddened starburst. There is,\nhowever, evidence for a marginally bluer spectral slope (f_lam propto\nlam^{-2.2) which is perhaps indicative of an extremely young starburst (~10 Myr\nold) or a top heavy initial mass function and little dust. The low levels of\ncontamination, median photometric redshift of z~6.0 and blue spectral slope,\ninferred using the near-infrared data, supports the validity of the assumptions\nin our earlier work in estimating the star formation rates and, that the\nmajority of the i-drop candidates galaxies lie at z~6.",

The Yin-Yang grid is composed of two identical component grids that\nare combined in a complemental way to cover a spherical surface with partial\noverlap on their boundaries. Each component grid is a low latitude part of the\nlatitude-longitude grid. Therefore the grid spacing is quasi-uniform and the\nmetric tensors are simple and analytically known. One can directly apply\nmathematical and numerical resources that have been written in the spherical\npolar coordinates or latitude-longitude grid. The complemental combination of\nthe two identical component grids enables us to make efficient and concise\nprograms. Simulation codes for geodynamo and mantle convection simulations\nusing finite difference scheme based on the Yin-Yang grid are developed and\ntested. The Yin-Yang grid is suitable for massively parallel computers.",

The model adopts up to date nucleosynthesis and takes into account\nthe role played by supernovae of different types (II, Ia) allowing us to follow\nin detail the evolution of several chemical elements (H, D, He, C, N, O, Mg,\nSi, S, Ca, and Fe).

These quantities are constrained by the star\nformation histories of the galaxies as inferred by the observed color-magnitude\ndiagrams (CMD). The main conclusions are: i) 5 of the 6 dSphs galaxies are\ncharacterized by very low star formation efficiencies ($\\nu = 0.005 - 0.5 Gyr\n^{-1}$) with only Sagittarius having a higher one ($\\nu = 1.0 - 5.0 Gyr\n^{-1}$); ii) the wind efficiency is high for all galaxies, in the range $w_i$ =\n6 - 15; iii) a high wind efficiency is required in order to reproduce the\nabundance ratios and the present day gas mass of the galaxies; iv) the\npredicted age-metallicity relation implies that the stars of the dSphs reach\nsolar metallicities in a time-scale of the order of 2 - 6 Gyr; v) the\nmetallicity distributions of stars in dSphs exhibit a peak around [Fe/H] $\\sim$\n-1.8 to -1.5 dex, with the exception of Sagittarius ([Fe/H] $\\sim$ -0.8 dex);\niv) the predicted metallicity distributions of stars suggest that the majority\nof stars in dSphs are formed in a range of metallicity in agreement with the\none of the observed stars.",

Here, we solve the analytically derived mean-field equations\nnumerically for integrate-and-fire neurons. Several known key properties of\norientation selective cortical neurons emerge naturally from the description:\nIrregular firing with statistics close to -- but not restricted to -- Poisson\nstatistics; an almost linear gain function (firing frequency as a function of\nstimulus contrast) of the neurons within the network; and a contrast-invariant\ntuning width of the neuronal firing. We find that the irregularity in firing\ndepends sensitively on synaptic strengths. If Fano factors are bigger than 1,\nthen they are so for all stimulus orientations that elicit firing. We also find\nthat the tuning of the noise in the input current is the same as the tuning of\nthe external input, while that for the mean input current depends on both the\nexternal input and the intracortical connectivity.",

First, we\nderive a model Hamiltonian of Coulomb interactions which includes both the\nlong-range part v_q and the short-range part U. It is found from the expression\nof the dielectric function that the strong on-site correlations weaken the\nCoulomb screening. Secondly, we examine the screened phonons and the\ninteraction mediated by phonons. In a consistent picture, we derive an\nexpression of the effective interaction which includes (1) the screened Coulomb\ninteractions, (2) the pairing interactions mediated by phonons, and (3) the\neffective interactions mediated by spin and charge fluctuations. It is\nrewritten in a form of a summation of (a) the effective interactions of the\npure Hubbard model without the long-range Coulomb interactions, and (b) the\nphonon-mediated interactions plus screened Coulomb interactions with\ncorrections due to both U and v_q. Thirdly, we derive an effective Hamiltonian\nanalogous to the BCS Hamiltonian. Fourthly, for some typical values of\nparameters, we obtain the ground state phase diagrams. It is found that\nspin-triplet superconductivity mediated by phonons occurs when the short-range\nelectron correlations are sufficiently strong, and the Coulomb screening is\nsufficiently weak. We estimate the orders of the transition temperatures when\nthe triplet superconductivity occurs. The obtained values are realistic for\nexisting candidates of the triplet superconductors as the order of the\nmagnitudes.

    "summary": "We analyze interstellar absorption observed towards two subdwarf O stars, JL\n9 and LSS 1274, using spectra taken by the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic\nExplorer (FUSE). Column densities are measured for many atomic and molecular\nspecies (H I, D I, C I, N I, O I, P II, Ar I, Fe II, and H2), but our main\nfocus is on measuring the D/H ratios for these extended lines of sight, as D/H\nis an important diagnostic for both cosmology and Galactic chemical evolution.\nWe find D/H=(1.00+/-0.37)e-5 towards JL 9, and D/H=(0.76+/-0.36)e-5 towards LSS\n1274 (2 sigma uncertainties). With distances of 590+/-160 pc and 580+/-100 pc,\nrespectively, these two lines of sight are currently among the longest Galactic\nlines of sight with measured D/H. With the addition of these measurements, we\nsee a significant tendency for longer Galactic lines of sight to yield low D/H\nvalues, consistent with previous inferences about the deuterium abundance from\nD/O and D/N measurements. Short lines of sight with H I column densities of log\nN(H I)<19.2 suggest that the gas-phase D/H value within the Local Bubble is\n(D/H)_LBg=(1.56+/-0.04)e-5. However, the four longest Galactic lines of sight\nwith measured D/H, which have d>500 pc and log N(H I)>20.5, suggest a\nsignificantly lower value for the true local-disk gas-phase D/H value,\n(D/H)_LDg=(0.85+/-0.09)e-5. One interpretation of these results is that D is\npreferentially depleted onto dust grains relative to H and that longer lines of\nsight that extend beyond the Local Bubble sample more depleted material. In\nthis scenario, the higher Local Bubble D/H ratio is actually a better estimate\nthan (D/H)_LDg for the true local-disk D/H, D/H)_LD. However, if (D/H)_LDg is\ndifferent from (D/H)_LBg simply because of variable astration and incomplete\nISM mixing, then (D/H)_LD=(D/H)_LDg.",

The purpose\nof this paper is to systematically develop a homotopy theory of pro-spectra and\nto study its relation to the usual homotopy theory of spectra, as a foundation\nfor future applications. The surprising result we find is that our homotopy\ntheory of pro-spectra is Quillen equivalent to the opposite of the homotopy\ntheory of spectra. This provides a convenient duality theory for all spectra,\nextending the classical notion of Spanier-Whitehead duality which works well\nonly for finite spectra. Roughly speaking, the new duality functor takes a\nspectrum to the cofiltered diagram of the Spanier-Whitehead duals of its finite\nsubcomplexes. In the other direction, the duality functor takes a cofiltered\ndiagram of spectra to the filtered colimit of the Spanier-Whitehead duals of\nthe spectra in the diagram. We prove the equivalence of homotopy theories by\nshowing that both are equivalent to the category of ind-spectra (filtered\ndiagrams of spectra).\n  To construct our new homotopy theories, we prove a general existence theorem\nfor colocalization model structures generalizing known results for cofibrantly\ngenerated model categories.",

These difficulties are related to the lack of precise\ndefinition of a reference frame in the GR. A reference frame is defined here as\na differential manifold with an affine connection. The resulting unique\ndecomposition of the Levi-Civita connection into its affine and nonmetric parts\nallows for a covariant definition of the gravitational energy-momentum tensor.\nIt is pointed out that the invariance of the Lagrangian (or action functional)\nis a necessary but not sufficient condition to secure the covariance of the\nLagrange-Euler field theory. A rigorous definition of the Lagrange Field\nStructure (LFS) on differential manifolds is proposed. A covariant\ngeneralization of the first Noether theorem for LFS is obtained.

First, an\namorphization process occurs in the ISM on a time scale significantly shorter\nthan the destruction time scale, possibly caused by particle bombardment by\nheavyweight ions.

    "summary": "A special class of molecules that are important to many subfields in\nmolecular dynamics and chemical physics, namely free radical molecules, now\nenjoy a significant degree of center-of-mass motion control in the laboratory\nframe. The example reported in this paper concerns hydroxyl radical (OH),\nwhich, after the internal degrees of freedom are cooled in a supersonic\nexpansion, has been bunched, accelerated, and slowed using time-varying\ninhomogeneous electric fields. In situ observations of laser-induced\nfluorescence along the beam propagation path allows for detailed\ncharacterization of the longitudinal phase-space manipulation of OH molecules\nby the electric fields. The creation of a pulse containing 1e3 to 1e6 molecules\npossessing a longitudinal velocity spread from 2 to 80 m/s around a mean\nlaboratory velocity variable from 550 m/s to rest with only a few mm spatial\nextent represents an exciting and useful new experimental capability for\nexploring free radical dynamics. This paper offers the most detailed study of\nthe Stark deceleration dynamics to date.",

    "summary": "This paper summarizes the results of 13 years of timing observations of a\nunique binary pulsar, PSR B1259$-$63, which has a massive B2e star companion.\nThe data span encompasses four complete orbits and includes the periastron\npassages in 1990, 1994, 1997 and 2000. Changes in dispersion measure occurring\naround the 1994, 1997 and 2000 periastrons are measured and accounted for in\nthe timing analysis. There is good evidence for a small glitch in the pulsar\nperiod in 1997 August, not long after the 1997 periastron, and a significant\nfrequency second derivative indicating timing noise. We find that spin-orbit\ncoupling with secular changes in periastron longitude and projected semi-major\naxis ($x$) cannot account for the observed period variations over the whole\ndata set. While fitting the data fairly well, changes in pulsar period\nparameters at each periastron seem ruled out both by X-ray observations and by\nthe large apparent changes in pulsar frequency derivative. Essentially all of\nthe systematic period variations are accounted for by a model consisting of the\n1997 August glitch and step changes in $x$ at each periastron. These changes\nmust be due to changes in the orbit inclination, but we can find no plausible\nmechanism to account for them. It is possible that timing noise may mask the\nactual changes in orbital parameters at each periastron, but the good fit to\nthe data of the $x$ step-change model suggests that short-term timing noise is\nnot significant.",

However\nthese methods largely ignore the number of flares the active region has already\nproduced, in particular the number of small events. The past history of\noccurrence of flares (of all sizes) is an important indicator to future flare\nproduction. We present a Bayesian approach to flare prediction, which uses the\nflaring record of an active region together with phenomenological rules of\nflare statistics to refine an initial prediction for the occurrence of a big\nflare during a subsequent period of time. The initial prediction is assumed to\ncome from one of the extant methods of flare prediction. The theory of the\nmethod is outlined, and simulations are presented to show how the refinement\nstep of the method works in practice.",

However\nwhen near-side and away-side hadrons are separated by several units of\nrapidity, quantum evolution effects lead to the depletion of back-to-back\ncorrelations as a function of rapidity interval between the detected hadrons\n(at fixed $p_T$). This applies to both $pp$ and $pA$ (or $dA$) collisions;\nhowever, due to the initial conditions provided by the Color Glass Condensate,\nthe depletion of the back-to-back correlations is significantly stronger in the\n$pA$ case.

    "summary": "The evidence of the acceleration of universe at present time has lead to\ninvestigate modified theories of gravity and alternative theories of gravity,\nwhich are able to explain acceleration from a theoretical viewpoint without the\nneed of introducing dark energy. In this paper we study alternative\ngravitational theories defined by Lagrangians which depend on general functions\nof the Ricci scalar invariant in minimal interaction with matter, in view of\ntheir possible cosmological applications. Structural equations for the\nspacetimes described by such theories are solved and the corresponding field\nequations are investigated in the Palatini formalism, which prevents\ninstability problems. Particular examples of these theories are also shown to\nprovide, under suitable hypotheses, a coherent theoretical explanation of\nearlier results concerning the present acceleration of the universe and\ncosmological inflation. We suggest moreover a new possible Lagrangian,\ndepending on the inverse of sinh(R), which gives an explanation to the present\nacceleration of the universe.",

An\napproximate decomposition of the impurity flux into a diffusive part and an\neffective convective part (characterized by a pinch velocity) is performed and\na net inward pinch effect is recovered. The pinch velocity is explained in\nterms of Turbulent Equipartition and is found to vary poloidally.

The\nobserved f(Halpha)/f(UV) ratio is ~ a factor of two smaller than the expected\none as determined from population synthesis models assuming a realistic\ndelayed, exponentially declining star formation history. We discuss various\nmechanisms that may have affected the observed f(Halpha)/f(UV) ratio and we\npropose that the above discrepancy arises from either the absorption of Lyman\ncontinuum photons by dust within the star formation regions or from the\noccurrence of star formation episodes. After splitting our sample into\ndifferent subsamples according to evolutionary criteria we find that our\nreference sample of galaxies unaffected by the cluster environment show an\naverage value of f(Halpha)/f(UV) two times lower than the expected one. We\nargue that this difference must be mostly due to absorption of ~ 45% of the\nLyman continuum photons within star forming regions. Galaxies with clear signs\nof an ongoing interaction show average values of f(Halpha)/f(UV) slightly\nhigher than the reference value, as expected if those objects had SFR increased\nby a factor of ~ 4.

Subspaces of the\nspaces of functions and of p-forms on R_q^N are made into Hilbert spaces by\nintroducing non-conventional ``weights'' in the integrals defining the\ncorresponding scalar products, namely suitable positive-definite\nq-pseudodifferential operators realizing the action of v^{\\pm 1}; this serves\nto make the partial q-derivatives antihermitean and the exterior coderivative\nequal to the hermitean conjugate of the exterior derivative, as usual. There is\na residual freedom in the choice of the weight m(r) along the `radial\ncoordinate' r. Unless we choose a constant m, then the square-integrables\nfunctions/forms must fulfill an additional condition, namely their analytic\ncontinuations to the complex r plane can have poles only on the sites of some\nspecial lattice. Among the functions naturally selected by this condition there\nare q-special functions with `quantized' free parameters.",

We analytically construct\ndeterministic dense coding schemes for certain classes of non-maximally\nentangled states, and numerically obtain schemes in the general case. We study\nthe dependency of the information capacity of such schemes on the partially\nentangled state shared by the two parties. Surprisingly, for $d>2$ it is\npossible to have deterministic dense coding with less than one ebit. In this\ncase the number of alphabet letters that can be communicated by a single\nparticle, is between $d$ and 2d. In general we show that the alphabet size\ngrows in \"steps\" with the possible values $ d, d+1, ..., d^2-2 $. We also find\nthat states with less entanglement can have greater communication capacity than\nother more entangled states.",

The abstraction is based on a survey of the\nprogress that has been achieved since relativistic wave equations for higher\nspin fields were first considered in the nineteen thirties. As a byproduct, a\nformalism is obtained that is abstract enough to describe a wide class of\nclassical field theories. The formalism, viewed as syntax, can then be\nsemantically mapped to a category of homotopy Lie algebras, thus showing that\nthe theory in some sense exists, at least as an abstract mathematical\nstructure. Still, a concrete physics-like, implementation remains to be\nconstructed. Lacking deep physical insight into the problem, an implementation\nin terms of generalized vertex operators is set up within which a brute force\niterative determination of the first few orders in the interaction can be\nattempted.",

    "summary": "BL Lacertae was the target of an extensive multiwavelength monitoring\ncampaign in the second half of 2000. In this paper, we are using leptonic and\nhadronic jet models to fit the observed broadband spectra and spectral\nvariability patterns. We start out with global spectral models. Subsequently,\nwe investigate various flaring scenarios for comparison with the observed\nshort-term variability. For our leptonic jet model, we find that the short-term\nvariability, in particular the optical and X-ray spectral variability, can be\nbest represented with a flaring scenario dominated by a spectral-index change\nof the spectrum of ultrarelativistic electrons injected into the jet. Based on\nthis result, a detailed model simulation, reproducing the observed optical and\nX-ray spectral variability and broadband SED of BL Lacertae simultaneously, is\npresented. Our leptonic modeling results are compared to fits using the\nhadronic synchrotron-proton blazar (SPB) model. That model can reproduce the\nobserved SEDs of BL Lacertae in a scenario with muon-synchrotron dominated\nhigh-energy emission. It requires a significantly higher magnetic field than\nthe leptonic model (~ 40 G vs. ~ 2 G in the leptonic model) and a lower Doppler\nfactor associated with the bulk motion of the emission region (D ~ 8 vs. D ~ 18\nin the leptonic model). The hadronic model predicts a significantly larger >\n100 GeV flux than the leptonic models, well within the anticipated capabilities\nof VERITAS and MAGIC.",

In the case of measurements, we show that the\ndiffusion coefficient is proportional to the variance of the initially\nlocalized quantum random walker just before the first measurement. When links\nbetween neighboring sites are randomly broken with probability $p$ per unit\ntime, the evolution becomes decoherent after a characteristic time that scales\nas $1/p$. The fact that the quadratic increase of the variance is eventually\nlost even for very small frequencies of disrupting events, suggests that the\nimplementation of a quantum walk on a real physical system may be severely\nlimited by thermal noise and lattice imperfections.",

Generalized flags in $V$ are\nchains of subspaces which in general cannot be enumerated by integers. Given a\nbasis $E$ of $V$, we define a notion of $E$--commensurability for generalized\nflags, and prove that the set $\\cFl (\\cF, E)$ of generalized flags\nE$--commensurable with a fixed generalized flag $\\cF$ in $V$ has a natural\nstructure of an ind--variety.

As an application of the construction, we compute the Picard\ngroup of $\\cFl (\\cF, E)$ (and of its isotropic analogs) and show that $\\cFl\n(\\cF, E)$ is a projective ind--variety if and only if $\\cF$ is a usual,\npossibly infinite, flag of subspaces in $V$.",

The hopping conductivity for the short\nrange interacting electrons acquires the same form as for noninteracting\nparticles if the one-particle density of states is replaced by the\ncompressibility. In the present paper we extend the calculation to dissipative\nsystems and give a discussion of the physics after the particles materialize\nbehind the tunneling barrier. It turns out that dissipation is crucial for\ntunneling to happen. Contrary to pure systems the new metastable state does not\npropagate through the system but is restricted to a region of the size of the\ntunneling region. This corresponds to the hopping of an integer number of\ncharges over a finite distance. A global current results only if tunneling\nevents fill the whole sample. We argue that rare events of extra low tunneling\nprobability are not relevant for realistic systems of finite length.

We find that\ntriaxiality significantly enhances lensing probabilities by a factor of ~2-4,\nso it cannot be ignored. If CDM halos have central density slopes alpha<~1.5,\nwe predict that a significant fraction (>~20%) of large-separation lenses\nshould have naked cusp image configurations; this contrasts with lensing by\nisothermal (\\alpha~2) galaxies where naked cusp configurations are rare. The\nimage multiplicities depend strongly on the inner density slope \\alpha: for\n\\alpha=1, the naked cusp fraction is >~60%; while for \\alpha=1.5, quadruple\nlenses are actually the most probable. Thus, the image multiplicities in\nlarge-separation lenses offer a simple new probe of the inner density profiles\nof dark matter halos. We also compute the expected probabilities and image\nmultiplicities for lensed quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and argue\nthat the recent discovery of the large-separation quadruple lens SDSS\nJ1004+4112 is consistent with expectations for CDM.",

For all companies we find that: (i) the probability density\nfunction of intertrade times may be fit by a Weibull distribution; (ii) when\nappropriately rescaled the probability densities of all companies collapse onto\na single curve implying a universal functional form; (iii) the intertrade times\nexhibit power-law correlated behavior within a trading day and a consistently\ngreater degree of correlation over larger time scales, in agreement with the\ncorrelation behavior of the absolute price returns for the corresponding\ncompany, and (iv) the magnitude series of intertrade time increments is\ncharacterized by long-range power-law correlations suggesting the presence of\nnonlinear features in the trading dynamics, while the sign series is\nanti-correlated at small scales. Our results suggest that independent of\nindustry sector, market capitalization and average level of trading activity,\nthe series of intertrade times exhibit possibly universal scaling patterns,\nwhich may relate to a common mechanism underlying the trading dynamics of\ndiverse companies. Further, our observation of long-range power-law\ncorrelations and a parallel with the crossover in the scaling of absolute price\nreturns for each individual stock, support the hypothesis that the dynamics of\ntransaction times may play a role in the process of price formation.",

    "summary": "Alternative splicing allows an organism to make different proteins in\ndifferent cells at different times, all from the same gene. In a cell that uses\nalternative splicing, the total length of all the exons is much shorter than in\na cell that encodes the same set of proteins without alternative splicing. This\neconomical use of exons makes genes more stable during reproduction and\ndevelopment because a genome with a shorter exon length is more resistant to\nharmful mutations. Genomic stability may be the reason why higher vertebrates\nsplice alternatively. For a broad class of alternatively spliced genes, a\nformula is given for the increase in their stability.",

The three-point correlation function of SDSS galaxies follow the\nhierarchical relation well and the reduced three-point amplitudes in\nredshift--space are almost scale-independent ($Q_z=0.5\\sim1.0$). In addition,\ntheir dependence on the morphology, color and luminosity is not statistically\nsignificant. Given the robust morphological, color and luminosity dependences\nof the two-point correlation function, this implies that galaxy biasing is\ncomplex on weakly non-linear to non-linear scales.

We show that, depending on the experimental conditions, the\nexpected recoil frequency shift can be partially cancelled by these effects\nwhich can be significant at microwave wavelengths whilst negligible at optical\nones. We derive analytical expressions for the observed interference signal in\nthe weak field approximation, and numerical results for realistic caesium\nfountain parameters. In the near future Cs and Rb fountain clocks are expected\nto reach uncertainties which are of the same order of magnitude (10^{-16}) as\nfirst estimates of the recoil shift at microwave frequencies. We show, however,\nthat the partial cancellation predicted by the complete theory presented here\nleads to frequency shifts which are up to an order of magnitude smaller.\nNonetheless observation of the microwave recoil shift should be possible under\nparticular experimental conditions (increased microwave power, variation of\natomic temperature and launching height etc.).

The WC7\n+ O4-5 spectroscopic binary WR 140 is the prototype of colliding-wind, episodic\ndust-making Wolf-Rayet systems which also show strong variations in radio and\nX-ray emission. The JHK spectra showed changes in continuum and in the\nequivalent widths of the WC emission lines, consistent with formation of dust\nstarting between 2001 January 3 and March 26 (orbital phases 0.989 and 0.017)\nand its subsequent fading and cooling. The 1.083-micron He I line has a P-Cygni\nprofile which showed variations in both absorption and emission components as\nWR 140 went through periastron passage. The variation of the absorption\ncomponent yielded tight constraints on the geometry of the wind-collision\nregion, giving theta = 50 +/- 8 degrees for the opening semi-angle of the\ninteraction `cone', indicating a wind-momentum ratio of the O to the WR\nstar=0.1, about three times larger than previously believed. As the system\napproached periastron, the emission component showed the appearance of a\nsignificant sub-peak, movement of which across the profile was seen to be\nconsistent with its formation in wind material flowing along the contact\ndiscontinuity between the two stellar winds and the changing orientation of the\ncolliding wind region. The flux carried in the sub-peak exceeded the X-ray\nfluxes measured at previous periastron passages. This additional source of\nradiative cooling of the shock-heated gas probably causes it to depart from\nbeing adiabatic around periastron passage, thereby accounting for the departure\nof the X-ray flux from its previously expected $1/d$-dependency.",

Two coherence peaks were observed in the sigma_1 versus\ntemperature curve at temperatures of ~0.5 Tc and ~0.9 Tc, respectively,\nproviding a direct evidence for the two-gap nature of MgB2. The film appeared\nto have a pi-band gap energy of 1.8 meV. For the MgB2 film ion-milled down to\nthe thickness of ~320 nm, two coherence peaks were still observed with the\nfirst conductivity peak at ~0.6 Tc. Reduction of Tc by 3 K and reduced\nnormal-state conductivity at Tc were observed along with an enhanced pi-band\ngap energy of 2.1 meV and a reduced Rs at temperatures below 15 K for the\nion-milled film.\n  Calculations based on the gap energies from the weak coupling\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory and the strong coupling theory suggest that\nboth the sigma-band and the pi-band contribute to sigma_1 of the\npolycrystalline MgB2 films significantly. Our results are in contrast with the\nobservation of single coherence peak at ~0.6 Tc and dominant role of the\npi-band in the microwave conductivity of c-axis oriented MgB2 films as reported\nby Jin et al.

It suggests that to avoid ultraviolet\ndivergencies and model faster-than-light effects it suffices to appropriately\nchange only the free-field Lagrangians while retaining their locality in\nspace-time and Lorentz invariance. Using functions of two independent\nfour-vector variables, we base this finite theory on the path-integral\nformalism on the four-dimensional space-time and the\nLehmann-Symanzik-Zimmermann reduction formula.",

    "summary": "The dynamics of flexible polymers in dilute solutions is studied taking into\naccount the hydrodynamic memory, as a consequence of fluid inertia. As distinct\nfrom the Rouse-Zimm (RZ) theory, the Boussinesq friction force acts on the\nmonomers (beads) instead of the Stokes force, and the motion of the solvent is\ngoverned by the nonstationary Navier-Stokes equations. The obtained generalized\nRZ equation is solved approximately. It is shown that the time correlation\nfunctions describing the polymer motion essentially differ from those in the RZ\nmodel. The mean-square displacement (MSD) of the polymer coil is at short times\n\\~ t^2 (instead of ~ t). At long times the MSD contains additional (to the\nEinstein term) contributions, the leading of which is ~ t^(1/2). The relaxation\nof the internal normal modes of the polymer differs from the traditional\nexponential decay. It is displayed in the long-time tails of their correlation\nfunctions, the longest-lived being ~ t^(-3/2) in the Rouse limit and t^(-5/2)\nin the Zimm case, when the hydrodynamic interaction is strong. It is discussed\nthat the found peculiarities, in particular an effectively slower diffusion of\nthe polymer coil, should be observable in dynamic scattering experiments.",

These X-rays should be observed more easily during periods of\nquiet Sun. An additional signature is the observed emission of hard X-rays by\nSMM, NEAR and RHESSI. The recent observation made by RHESSI of a continuous\nemission from the non-flaring Sun of X-rays in the 3 to ~15 keV range fits the\ngeneric axion scenario. This work also suggests new analyses of existing data,\nin order to exclude instrumental effects; it provides the rationale for\ntargeted observations with present and upcoming (solar) X-ray telescopes, which\ncan provide the final answer on the nature of the signals considered here. Such\nmeasurements become more promising during the forthcoming solar cycle minimum\nwith an increased number of quiet Sun periods.",

For the present sample it is empirically\ndetermined that for log P < 1.65 linear PL-relations may be adopted, but this\nrestricts the sample to only 4 LMC and 1 SMC cepheid. Considering the Galactic\nsample a metallicity effect is found in the zero point in the VIWK PL-relation\n(-0.6 \\pm 0.4 or -0.8 \\pm 0.3 mag/dex depending on the in- or exclusion of one\nobject), in the sense that metal-rich cepheids are brighter. The small\nsignificance is mostly due to the fact that the Galactic sample spans a narrow\nmetallicity range. The error is to a significant part due to the error in the\nmetallicity determinations and not to the error in the fit. Including the 5 MC\ncepheids broadens the observed metallicity range and a metallity effect of\nabout -0.27 \\pm 0.08 mag/dex in the zero point is found in VIWK, in agreement\nwith some previous empirical estimates, but now derived using direct\nmetallicity determinations for the cepheids themselves.",

Unusually, we do not detect any orbital modulation in\nthe UV, with only marginal evidence for X-ray modulation on this period.\nAlthough there are peaks in the X-ray periodograms at periods less than 5000 s,\nwe attribute them to red noise effects and assign significance to them using a\nnovel approach. The variability in the UV and optical bands can also be\nmodelled as a result of aperiodic variability (red noise) in the system. There\nis evidence that the UV and X-ray fluxes are anti-correlated with a time delay\nof about 100 s, with the UV lagging behind the X-ray emission. This\nanti-correlation is intriguing, but is only present on two occasions lasting\nseveral 1000 s each. The X-ray spectrum shows similar emission features to\nother dwarf novae and is well fitted using a multi-temperature emission model.\nWe measure a relatively high X-ray luminosity of ~1.4x10^{32} ergs/s, although\nthis is consistent with a low binary inclination.

We propose, that striking morphology of\nthe large-scale radio jet in this source, as well as the apparent lack of its\ncounterpart on the opposite side of the active center, may be explained in a\nframework of a restarting jet model. In particular, we propose that 3C 273\nradio source is intrinsically two-sided, and represents an analogue of\ndouble-double radio galaxies, but only inclined at a small angle to the line of\nsight. In this case, the apparent one-sideness of the kiloparsec-scale radio\nstructure may be due to combined Doppler and time-travel effects alone, if the\n3C 273 large-scale jet itself is relativistic and matter-dominated. We also\npropose, that knotty morphology of the discussed jet, which is observed now\nadditionally at optical and X-ray frequencies, indicates modulation in the jet\nkinetic power. This, together with the variability of the jet at small (parsec)\nscales, indicates that the jet activity in 3C 273, and possibly in other\nsimilar sources, is variable/modulated/intermittent over many different\ntime-scales.",

    "summary": "Potential resonances are usually investigated either directly in the complex\nenergy plane or indirectly in the complex angular momentum plane. Another\nformulation complementing these two is presented in this work. It is an\nindirect method which studies resonances in a complex charge plane (Z-plane).\nThe complex scaling (rotation) method is employed in the development of this\nformulation. Bound states spectrum and resonance energies are mapped onto a\ndiscrete set of poles of a resolvent operator on the real line of the Z-plane.\nThese poles move along trajectories as we vary the energy. A finite L2 basis is\nused in the numerical implementation of the method. Stability of poles and\ntrajectories against variations in all computational parameters is\ndemonstrated. Resonances for a given potential example are calculated and\ncompared with those obtained elsewhere. In this presentation, modest effort\nwill be devoted to mathematical rigor.",

We present the results of global, three-dimensional, SPH\nsimulations of self-gravitating accretion discs, in which the disc is cooled\nusing a simple parametrisation for the cooling function. Our simulations show\nthat the disc settles in a ``self-regulated'' state, where the axisymmetric\nstability parameter $Q\\approx 1$ and where transport and energy dissipation are\ndominated by self-gravity. We have computed the gravitational stress tensor and\ncompared our results with expectations based on a local theory of transport. We\nfind that, as long as the disc mass is smaller than $0.25M_{\\star}$ and the\naspect ratio $H/R\\lesssim 0.1$, transport is determined locally, thus allowing\nfor a viscous treatment of the disc evolution.",

We propose a semi-analytical approach to\ndetermine the effective number of trial frequencies when searching for unknown\nperiods over a frequency range. This approach can be easily adapted to other\ntests. We show that, using Kuiper's test, we can recover periods in frequency\ndomains where other tests are completely confused by contamination.

Our monitoring observations of the pulsar took place bi-weekly\n(during the periods when it was at least 30 degrees from the Sun) and we\ncorrelated the data with radio timing ephemerides derived from observations\nmade at Jodrell Bank. We have determined the phase of the X-ray main pulse for\neach observation with a typical error in the individual data points of 50 us.\nThe total ensemble is consistent with a phase that is constant over the\nmonitoring period, with the X-ray pulse leading the radio pulse by\n0.0102+/-0.0012 period in phase, or 344+/-40 us in time. The error estimate is\ndominated by a systematic error of 40 us in the radio data, arising from\nuncertainties in the variable amount of pulse delay due to interstellar\nscattering and instrumental calibration. The statistical error is 0.00015\nperiod, or 5 us. The separation of the main pulse and interpulse appears to be\nunchanging at time scales of a year or less, with an average value of\n0.4001+/-0.0002 period. There is no apparent variation in these values with\nenergy over the 2-30 keV range.

These\nprocesses turn out to be transformations of bridges with exchangeable\nincrements, which have already appeared in other ICRT related topics such as\nstochastic additive coalescence.

    "summary": "This paper presents an analysis of the concentration of the hydrogen molecule\ninside the ionized region of planetary nebulae. The equations corresponding to\nthe ionization and chemical equilibria of H, H+, H-, H2, H2+, and H3+ are\ncoupled with the equations of ionization and thermal balance for a photoionized\natomic gas. Forty different reactions related to the formation or the\ndestruction of these species are included. The presence of dust is taken into\naccount, since grains act as catalysts for the production of H2, as well as\nshield the molecules against the stellar ionizing radiation. We analyze the\neffect of the stellar ionizing continuum, as well as of the gas and grain\nproperties on the calculated H2 mass. It is shown that a significant\nconcentration of H2 can survive inside the ionized region of planetary nebulae,\nmostly in the inner region of the recombination zone. The total H2 to total\nhydrogen mass ratio inside the ionized region increases with the central star\ntemperature, and, depending on the PN physical conditions, it can be of the\norder of 10^-6 or even higher. The increase of the recombination zone with the\nstellar temperature can account for such correlation. This can explain why the\nH2 emission is more frequently observed in bipolar planetary nebulae (Gatley's\nrule), since this kind of object has typically hotter stars. Applying our\nresults for the planetary nebula NGC 6720, we obtain an H2 to hydrogen mass\nratio similar to the value obtained from the observed H2 line emission.",

Although many experimental systems\nhave employed a mean photon number (mu) of 0.1 in practice, several research\nteams have pointed out that this value is somewhat arbitrary. In fact, various\noptimal values for mu have been described in the literature.\n  In this paper we offer a detailed analytic model for an experimental,\nfiber-based quantum cryptographic system, and an explicit set of reasonable\nassumptions about Eve's current technical capabilities. We explicitly model\ntotal system behavior ranging from physical effects to the results of quantum\ncryptographic protocols such as error correction and privacy amplification. We\nthen derive the optimal photon number (mu) for this system in a range of\nscenarios. One interesting result is that mu of approximately 1.1 is optimal\nfor a wide range of realistic, fiber-based QKD systems; in fact, it provides\nnearly 10 times the distilled throughput of systems that employ a more\nconventional mu = 0.1, without any adverse affect on system security, as judged\nagainst a set of reasonable assumptions about Eve's current capabilities.",

This is one of the clearest\nexamples of HI outflow detected in a dwarf galaxy. We find no obvious external\ntrigger for this extended star formation event.

If this identification is correct, we show that the\nintergalactic medium (IGM) around the galaxy must be significantly ionized;\notherwise, the damping wing of Lyman-alpha absorption by the neutral IGM would\nhave greatly suppressed the emission line. We find either that the large-scale\nregion surrounding this galaxy must have been largely reionized by z=10 (with a\nneutral fraction <0.4) or that the stars within the galaxy must be massive\n(>100 solar masses), and hence capable of producing a sufficiently large HII\nregion around it. We generalize these conclusions and derive the maximum\nLyman-alpha line flux for a given UV continuum flux of galaxies prior to the\nepoch of reionization.",

However, the\nlarge areas of the RXTE pointed instruments provide another capability which is\nkey for the understanding of accreting X-ray pulsars -- the ability to\naccumulate high quality spectra in a limited observing time. For the accreting\nX-ray pulsars, with their relatively modest spin frequencies, this translates\ninto an ability to study broad band spectra as a function of pulse phase. This\nis a critical tool, as pulsar spectra are strong functions of the geometry of\nthe \"accretion mound\" and the observers' viewing angle to the ~10^12 G magnetic\nfield. In particular, the appearance of \"cyclotron lines\" is sensitively\ndependent on the viewing geometry, which must change with the rotation of the\nstar. These spectral features, seen in only a handful of objects, are quite\nimportant, as they give us our only direct measure of neutron star magnetic\nfields. Furthermore, they carry a great deal of information as to the geometry\nand physical conditions in the accretion mound. In this paper, we review the\nstatus of cyclotron line studies with the RXTE. We present an overview of\nphase-averaged results and give examples of observations which illustrate the\npower of phase-resolved spectroscopy.",

The dominant long standing interpretation of QPO's is that\nthey are produced in and are the signature of the thermal accretion disk.\nParadoxically, strong QPO`s are present even in the cases where the thermal\ncomponent is negligible. We present a model which identifies the origin of the\nQPO's and relates them directly to the properties of a compact coronal region\nwhich is bounded by the adjustment from Keplerian to sub-Keplerian inflow into\nthe BH and which is primarily responsible for the observed power law spectrum.\nThe model also predicts the relationship between high and low frequency QPO's\nand shows how BH's can be unique identified from observations of the soft\nstates of NS's and BHC's.",

The Hueckel model\ncalculations were performed on oligo-PDPA's containing up to fifty repeat\nunits, while correlated calculations were performed for oligomers containing up\nto ten unit cells. At all levels of theory, the material exhibits highly\nanisotropic nonlinear optical response, in keeping with its structural\nanisotropy. We argue that the aforesaid anisotropy can be divided over two\nnatural energy scales: (a) the low-energy response is predominantly\nlongitudinal and is qualitatively similar to that of polyenes, while (b) the\nhigh-energy response is mainly transverse, and is qualitatively similar to that\nof trans-stilbene.",

The conditions for quark\nbubble formation are analyzed within the frameworks of both dissipative and\nnon-dissipative (with zero bulk and shear viscosity coefficients) approaches.\nThe conversion time of the neutron star to a quark star is obtained as a\nfunction of the equation of state of the neutron matter and of the microscopic\nparameters of the quark nuclei. As an application of the obtained formalism we\nanalyze the first order phase transition from neutron matter to quark matter in\nrapidly rotating neutron stars cores, triggered by the gravitational energy\nreleased during the spinning down of the neutron star.

Such work\ntypically invokes a generic parameterization which assumes a power-law\nvariation with the expansion scale factor, R. This work offers alternative,\nphysically motivated definitions for the parameters c, G, and h based on the\nMachian premise that these dimensional quantities reflect global dynamics of\nthe expansion geometry. Together with a postulated conservation law and\nequations of motion, the implications of this theory for Friedmann models are\nexamined, and found to yield several interesting conclusions including: (1)\nnatural solutions to the horizon, flatness, and lambda problems, (2) the\nprediction of a flat, Omega_0 = 1 universe, (3) different forms for some\ncosmological scaling laws, (4) an apparent fit to observations of Type Ia\nsupernovae without invoking a cosmological constant, (5) equivalence between\nour Universe and a black hole and apparent consistency of the model with the\nHolographic Principle, and (6) potentially testable predictions for the time\nvariation of physical parameters, including values for c_dot and h_dot that are\nsmall but non-zero today and a value for G_dot that was negative and nonzero\nduring radiation domination and decayed to effectively zero upon the epoch of\nmatter domination.

The c-lattice parameter\nincreases with increasing x, indicating successful substitution of Y3+ by\nbigger Ca2+ ion. Resistance versus temperature (R vs. T) measurements show that\npristine sample (x = 0.0) is semiconducting down to 5 K. Induction of\nsuperconductivity is seen with an increase in x. The x = 0.10 sample exhibit\nthe onset of superconducting transition (Tconset) at around 42 K without\nattaining zero resistance superconducting transition temperature (TcR=0) state\ndown to 5 K. For x = 0.15 and 0.20 samples TcR=0 is observed at 25 K and 35 K\nwith Tconset of 52 K and 61 K respectively. Thermo-electric power (S)\nmeasurements in temperature range of 5 - 300 K, exhibited TcS=0 at around 25 K\nand 35 K respectively for x = 0.15 and 0.20 samples.

    "summary": "We describe string production after angled brane inflation. First, we point\nout that there was a discrepancy in previous discussions. The expected tension\nof the cosmic string calculated from the four-dimensional effective Lagrangian\ndid not match the one obtained in the brane analysis. In the previous analysis,\nthe cosmic string is assumed to correspond to the lower-dimensional daughter\nbrane, which wraps the same compactified space as the original mother brane. In\nthis case, however, the tension of the daughter brane cannot depend on the\nangle (\\theta). On the other hand, from the analysis of the effective\nLagrangian for tachyon condensation, it is easy to see that the tension of the\ncosmic string must be proportional to \\theta, when \\theta << 1. This is an\nobvious discrepancy that must be explained by consideration of the explicit\nbrane dynamics. In this paper, we will solve this problem by introducing a\nsimple idea. We calculate the tension of the string in the two cases, which\nmatches precisely. The cosmological constraint for angled inflation is relaxed,\nbecause the expected tension of the cosmic string becomes smaller than the one\nobtained in previous arguments, by a factor of \\theta.",

The decay of the $\\Theta_5$ pentaquark into the\nnucleon and kaon requires the breakup of the non-planar diamond configuration\ninto two conventional planar hadrons, which involves some kind of structural\nphase transition as in the condensed matter physics. Hence the width of the\n$\\Theta^+$ pentaquark should be narrow despite that it lies above the kaon\nnucleon threshold.

    "summary": "We have considered the most general gauge invariant five-dimensional action\nof a second rank antisymmetric Kalb-Ramond tensor gauge theory, including a\ntopological term of the form $\\epsilon^{ABLMN}B_{AB}H_{LMN}$ in a\nRandall-Sundrum scenario. Such a tensor field $B_{AB}$ (whose rank-3 field\nstrength tensor is $H_{LMN}$), which appears in the massless sector of a\nheterotic string theory, is assumed to coexist with the gravity in the bulk.\nThe third rank field strength corresponding to the Kalb-Ramond field has a\nwell-known geometric interpretation as the spacetime torsion. The only\nnon-trivial classical solutions corresponding to the effective four-dimensional\naction are found to be self-dual or anti-selfdual Kalb-Ramond fields. This\nensures that the four-dimensional effective action on the brane is\nparity-conserving. The massive modes for both cases, lying in the TeV range,\nare related to the fundamental parameters of the theory. These modes can be\nwithin the kinematic reach of forthcoming TeV scale experiments. However, the\ncouplings of the massless as well as massive Kalb-Ramond modes with matter on\nthe visible brane are found to be suppressed vis-a-vis that of the graviton by\nthe warp factor, whence the conclusion is that both the massless and the\nmassive torsion modes appear much weaker than curvature to an observer on the\nvisible brane.",

This\nnaturally generalizes the commonly-used distinction problem between two\nprobability distributions in computational cryptography. As our major\ncontribution, we show that QSCDff has three properties of cryptographic\ninterest: (i) QSCDff has a trapdoor; (ii) the average-case hardness of QSCDff\ncoincides with its worst-case hardness; and (iii) QSCDff is computationally at\nleast as hard as the graph automorphism problem in the worst case. These\ncryptographic properties enable us to construct a quantum public-key\ncryptosystem, which is likely to withstand any chosen plaintext attack of a\npolynomial-time quantum adversary.

The exception that they\nmention is the case in which V is symmetric, which leads to V-Cat being\nsymmetric as well. The symmetry in V-Cat is based upon the symmetry of V. The\nmotivation behind this paper is in part to describe how these facts relating V\nand V-Cat are in turn related to a categorical analogue of topological\ndelooping. To do so I need to pass to a more general setting than braided and\nsymmetric categories -- in fact the k-fold monoidal categories of Balteanu et\nal in [Iterated Monoidal Categories, Adv. Math. 176(2003) 277-349]. It seems\nthat the analogy of loop spaces is a good guide for how to define the concept\nof enrichment over various types of monoidal objects, including k-fold monoidal\ncategories and their higher dimensional counterparts. The main result is that\nfor V a k-fold monoidal category, V-Cat becomes a (k-1)-fold monoidal\n2-category in a canonical way. In the next paper I indicate how this process\nmay be iterated by enriching over V-Cat, along the way defining the 3-category\nof categories enriched over V-Cat. In future work I plan to make precise the\nn-dimensional case and to show how the group completion of the nerve of V is\nrelated to the loop space of the group completion of the nerve of V-Cat.\n  This paper is an abridged version of `Enrichment as categorical delooping I'\nmath.CT/0304026.",

The stoichiometry was modified by\ncontrolling the in-situ sample anneal conditions. We have found the conditions\nthat lead to the formation of an oxygen-rich surface that forms a\nquasi-hexagonal superstructure with a 42A periodicity. The superstructure is\nhighly regular and was observed by both LEED and STM. The superstructure\nconsists of three regions, two of which have identical atomic scale structures\nwith a periodicity of 2.8A, and a third having a periodicity that is about 10%\nlarger (3.1A). The subtle difference in the atomic periodicities between the\nthree areas results from the modulation of intrinsic strain developed along the\nsurface. The superstructure results from electronic effects rather than being a\nmosaic of different iron oxide terminations. The onset of the superstructure is\nsensitive to the surface stoichiometry. From our results we could estimate the\ncritical density of defects leading to the disappearance of the superstructure.\nWe have modelled the experimental results and calculated the electron density\nusing a DFT algorithm. The model clearly shows the development of strain along\nthe surface.",

    "summary": "We report extensive photometry of frequently outbursting dwarf nova IX\nDraconis. During five months of observations the star went into three\nsuperoutbursts and seven ordinary outbursts. This allowed us to determine its\nsupercycle and cycle lengths as equal to 54 +/- 1 and 3.1 +/- 0.1 days,\nrespectively. During the Sep 2003 superoutburst, which had the best\nobservational coverage, IX Dra displayed clear superhumps with a period of\nPsh=0.066968(17) days. This period was constant during the whole superoutburst.\nAnother period, which was clearly present in the light curve of IX Dra in\nsuperoutburst, had a value of 0.06646(6) days and we interpret it as the\norbital period of the binary. Thus IX Dra is the first SU UMa star showing\norbital modulation during the entire superoutburst. The beat between these two\nperiods is the main cause of an unusual phase reversal of superhumps - a\nphenomenon which was previously observed in ER UMa. If our interpretation of\nthe second periodicity is correct, IX Dra has an extremely low period excess\n$\\epsilon$ equal to only 0.76% +/- 0.03%. This implies very low mass ratio\nq=0.035 +/- 0.003, which strongly suggests that the system contains a brown\ndwarf-like degenerate secondary of mass ~0.03 Mo and that IX Dra is the most\nevolved dwarf nova known. Such a very low mass ratio results in the outer edge\nof the accretion disk reaching 80% of the distance between the components of\nthe system. In turn, this allows the disk particles to enter a 2:1 resonance\nand leads to the appearance of the orbital period in the light curve of the\nentire superoutburst.The high level of activity and brightness of IX Dra\nindicate that very old cataclysmic variables go through episodes of increased\nactivity leading to loss of angular momentum through mass loss from the system.",

The method is based on a\nconstrained-least-squares (\\clsq) data fitting procedure together with the\nMonte Carlo (\\mc) method. We preselect the number of relaxation times with no\n{\\em a-priori} physical assumption, and use the Debye single relaxation as\n``kernel'', then the obtained weighting factors at each \\mc step from the \\clsq\nmethod builds up a relaxation time spectrum. When the analysis is repeated for\ndata at different temperatures a {\\em relaxation-image} is created.

A comparison of the\nrelaxations to those earlier reported in the literature indicate that the\npresented method provides additional information compared to methods based on\nempirical formulas. The distribution of relaxation times analysis is especially\nuseful to probe the crossover region where the $\\alpha$- and $\\beta$-\nrelaxations merge and the results show that the relaxation after the crossover\nregion at higher temperatures is Arrhenius-type as the $\\beta$-relaxation.\nMoreover, this relaxation is more likely to be the continuation of the\n$\\beta$-relaxation, but with a different activation energy.",

After a Monte Guide\ndescription, the first contributions report on progress in describing multiple\ninteractions, important for the LHC, and underlying events. An announcement of\na Monte Carlo database, under construction, is then followed by a number of\ncontributions improving parton shower descriptions. Subsequently, a large\nnumber of contributions address resummations in various forms, after which\nfollow studies of QCD effects in pion pair, top quark pair and photon pair plus\njet production. After a study of electroweak corrections to hadronic precision\nobservables, the report ends by presenting recent progress in methods to\ncompute finite order corrections at one-loop with many legs, and at two-loop.",

A major fraction is transfered in the prompt regime of driven\nturbulence. The subsequent long stage of thermalization classifies as free\nturbulence. During the turbulent stages, the evolution of particle distribution\nfunctions is self-similar. We show that wave kinetic theory successfully\ndescribes the late stages of our lattice calculation.

Needed narrowing is\nan optimal evaluation strategy which constitutes the basis of modern\n(narrowing-based) lazy functional logic languages. In this work, we present the\nfundamentals of partial evaluation in such languages. We provide correctness\nresults for partial evaluation based on needed narrowing and show that the nice\nproperties of this strategy are essential for the specialization process. In\nparticular, the structure of the original program is preserved by partial\nevaluation and, thus, the same evaluation strategy can be applied for the\nexecution of specialized programs. This is in contrast to other partial\nevaluation schemes for lazy functional logic programs which may change the\nprogram structure in a negative way. Recent proposals for the partial\nevaluation of declarative multi-paradigm programs use (some form of) needed\nnarrowing to perform computations at partial evaluation time. Therefore, our\nresults constitute the basis for the correctness of such partial evaluators.",

Since P_n(x;q^\\alpha, q^\\alpha, -q^\\alpha; q) tend to Gegenbauer (or\nultraspherical) polynomials in the limit as q->1, this family represents yet\nanother q-extension of these classical polynomials, different from the\ncontinuous q-ultraspherical polynomials of Rogers. The dual family with respect\nto the polynomials P_n(x;a,a,-a;q) (i.e., the dual discrete q-ultraspherical\npolynomials) corresponds to the indeterminate moment problem, that is, these\npolynomials have infinitely many orthogonality relations. We find orthogonality\nrelations for these polynomials, which have not been considered before. In\nparticular, extremal orthogonality measures for these polynomials are derived.",

The ejection force arises from\nthe energy stored in the capsid as a consequence of the viral genome\n(double-stranded DNA) being strongly bent and crowded on itself. The resisting\nforce is associated with the osmotic pressure exerted by the colloidal\nparticles in the host solution. Indeed, recent experimental work has\ndemonstrated that the extent of ejection can be progressively limited by\nincreasing the external osmotic pressure; at a sufficiently high pressure the\nejection is completely suppressed. We outline here a theoritical analysis that\nallows a determination of the internal (capsid) pressure by examining the\ndifferent relations between force and pressure inside and outside the capsid,\nusing the experimentally measured position of the force balance.",

The astrometric CID method discussed here is complementary to the\nphotometric selection of binary stars in SDSS discussed by Smolcic et al.\n(2004), but there is considerable overlap (15%) between the two samples of\nselected candidates.

Using the Very Large Array,\nwe simultaneously observed the v=0, J=1-0, 43.4-GHz, ground-state and the v=1,\nJ=1-0, 43.1-GHz, first excited-state transitions of SiO toward the oxygen-rich\nevolved stars IRC+10011, o Ceti, W Hya, RX Boo, NML Cyg, and R Cas and the\nS-type star chi Cyg. We detected at least one v=0 SiO maser feature from six of\nthe seven stars observed, with peak maser brightness temperatures ranging from\n10,000 K to 108,800 K. In fact, four of the seven v=0 spectra show multiple\nmaser peaks, a phenomenon which has not been previously observed. Ground-state\nthermal emission was detected for one of the stars, RX Boo, with a peak\nbrightness temperature of 200 K. Comparing the v=0 and the v=1 transitions, we\nfind that the ground-state masers are much weaker with spectral characteristics\ndifferent from those of the first excited-state masers. For four of the seven\nstars the velocity dispersion is smaller for the v=0 emission than for the v=1\nemission, for one star the dispersions are roughly equivalent, and for two\nstars (one of which is RX Boo) the velocity spread of the v=0 emission is\nlarger. In most cases, the peak flux density in the v=0 emission spectrum does\nnot coincide with the v=1 maser peak. Although the angular resolution of these\nVLA observations were insufficient to completely resolve the spatial structure\nof the SiO emission, the SiO spot maps produced from the interferometric image\ncubes suggest that the v=0 masers are more extended than their v=1\ncounterparts.",

A novel feature of this investigation is the role played by the\nscales Delta and delta_s, where Delta is the mass difference between the\nheavy-light vector and pseudoscalar mesons of the same quark content, and\ndelta_s is the mass difference due to light flavour SU(3) breaking. The primary\nconclusion of this work is that finite volume effects arising from the\npropagation of Goldstone particles in the effective theory can be altered by\nthe presence of these scales. Since Delta varies significantly with the heavy\nquark mass, these volume effects can be amplified in both heavy and light quark\nmass extrapolations (interpolations). As an explicit example, we present\nresults for B parameters of neutral B meson mixing matrix elements and\nheavy-light decay constants to one-loop order in finite volume heavy meson\nchiral perturbation theory for full, quenched, and N_f=2+1 partially quenched\nQCD. Our calculation shows that for high-precision determinations of the\nphenomenologically interesting SU(3) breaking ratios, finite volume effects are\nsignificant in quenched and not negligible in partially quenched QCD, although\nthey are generally small in full QCD.",

We demonstrate that the rapid suppression\nof the ratio R_{pA} in the early stages of the evolution is due to the\nDGLAP-like evolution of the proton, whose gluon distribution grows much faster\nthan that in the nucleus because of the large separation between the respective\nsaturation momenta. The flattening of the Cronin peak, on the other hand, is\ndue to the evolution of the nucleus.

In particular we explore the limit of strong coupling, low\ndissipation, and elevated temperatures relevant for current and future\nexperiments. We concentrate on the cavity susceptibility as it can be directly\nexperimentally addressed, i.e., as the impedance or the reflection coefficient\nof the cavity. To this end we investigate the dissipative Jaynes-Cummings model\nin the strong coupling regime at high temperatures. The dynamics is\ninvestigated within the Bloch-Redfield formalism. At low temperatures, when\nonly the few lowest levels are occupied the susceptibility can be presented as\na sum of contributions from independent level-to-level transitions. This\ncorresponds to the secular (random phase) approximation in the Bloch-Redfield\nformalism. At temperatures comparable to and higher than the oscillator\nfrequency, many transitions become important and a multiple-peak structure\nappears. We show that in this regime the secular approximation breaks down, as\nsoon as the peaks start to overlap. In other words, the susceptibility is no\nlonger a sum of contributions from independent transitions. We treat the\ndynamics of the system numerically by exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian\nof the qubit plus up to 200 states of the oscillator. We compare the results\nobtained with and without the secular approximation and find a qualitative\ndiscrepancy already at moderate temperatures.",

Assuming strict angular momentum conservation, all models in this\nrange leave behind neutron stars with spin periods <10 ms, shorter than those\nof most radio pulsars, but similar to those expected theoretically for\nmagnetars at birth. A fraction of the gravitational binding energy of collapse\nis stored in the free energy of differential rotation. This energy source may\nbe tapped by viscous processes, providing a mechanism for energy deposition\nthat is not strongly coupled to the mass accretion rate through the stalled\nsupernova shock. This effect yields qualitatively new dynamics in models of\nsupernovae. We explore several potential mechanisms for viscosity in the\ncore-collapse environment: neutrino viscosity, turbulent viscosity caused by\nthe magnetorotational instability (MRI), and turbulent viscosity by entropy-\nand composition-gradient-driven convection. We argue that the MRI is the most\neffective.

The scattered star-forming regions tend to be long-lived and\nmigrate slowly. Older populations have a spatially more extended and regular\ndistribution. In fast-rotating Irrs high star formation rates with stronger\nconcentration toward the galaxies' center are observed, and cluster formation\nis facilitated. In slowly or nonrotating dwarf Irrs (dIrrs) star formation\noccurs more quiescently, and the formation of OB associations is common. Irrs\nand dIrrs tend to experience continuous star formation with amplitude\nvariations and to continue to form stars for another Hubble time. Irrs exhibit\nlower effective yields than spirals, and [alpha/Fe] ratios below the solar\nvalue. This may be indicative of fewer Type II SNe and lower astration rates in\ntheir past. Alternatively, many metals may be lost from the shallow galaxy\npotential wells due to selective winds. The differences in the\nmetallicity-luminosity relation between dIrrs and dwarf spheroidals (which,\ndespite their lower masses, tend to have too high a metallicity for their\nluminosity as compared to dIrrs) further supports the idea of slow astration\nand slow enrichment in dIrrs. The current data on age-metallicity relations are\nstill too sparse to distinguish between infall, leaky-box, and closed-box\nmodels. The preferred location of dIrrs in the outer parts of galaxy groups and\nclusters and in the field as well as the positive correlation between gas\ncontent and distance from massive galaxies indicate that these dIrrs probably\nhave not yet experienced significant interactions or galaxy harassment.\n(Abridged)",

Another is to analyze those data in terms of tunneling in\nsemi-classical models, with the observed depletion being taken as evidence of a\n``friction'' under the barrier. A complementary approach is to consider such\ntunneling in terms of a fully quantal model. We investigate tunneling with both\none-dimensional and three-dimensional models in a fully quantal approach to\ninvestigate possible sources for such a friction. We find that the observed\nphenomenon may not be explained by friction.

It is important to\ngeneralize this scheme to higher dimensional networks, since a real device\nwould probably be of that kind. Such generalisations have been proposed, but\nonly at the severe cost that the efficiency of qubit storage must *fall*. Here\nwe propose the use of multi-qubit gates within such higher-dimensional arrays,\nfinding a novel three-qubit gate that can in fact increase the efficiency\nbeyond the linear model.

Unlike a typical situation in which a disordered secondary phase results\nin diffuse powder scattering, a serendipitous match between the in-plane\nlattice constant of NCCO and the lattice constant of one of the decomposition\nproducts, (Nd,Ce)2O3, causes the secondary phase to form an oriented,\nquasi-two-dimensional epitaxial structure. Consequently, diffraction peaks from\nthe secondary phase appear at rational positions (H,K,0) in the reciprocal\nspace of NCCO. Additionally, because of neodymium paramagnetism, the\napplication of a magnetic field increases the low-temperature intensity\nobserved at these positions via neutron scattering. Such effects may mimic the\nformation of a structural superlattice or the strengthening of\nantiferromagnetic order of NCCO, but the intrinsic mechanism may be identified\nthrough careful and systematic experimentation. For typical reduction\nconditions, the (Nd,Ce)2O3 volume fraction is ~1%, and the secondary-phase\nlayers exhibit long-range order parallel to the NCCO CuO2 sheets and are 50-100\nangstromsthick.

Essential for this\ntechnique are well-resolved images of background galaxies out to large\ndistances. As a concrete example of the surveys that will become available by\nthe end of the decade, we consider the planned Supernova/Acceleration Probe\n(SNAP) space telescope. Detailed simulations of space-based images,\nmanufactured using the shapelets formalism, enable us to quantitatively predict\nthe future sensitivity to weak lensing shear. The high number density of\ngalaxies resolved from space will enable maps of dark matter to be produced in\ntwo and three dimensions, with a resolution superior to that from the ground.\nSuch observations will also afford reduced systematics for high-precision\nmeasurements of weak lensing statistics. These will be used to set tight\nconstraints on cosmological parameters. In particular, the parameter for\nequation of state of dark energy, w, will be measured using weak lensing with a\nprecision comparable to and somewhat orthogonal to constraints from other\nmethods.",

Asymptotically flat solutions form a five-parametric subspace,\nwhile conditions of regularity of the non-degenerate event horizon further\nrestrict this number to three, which can be related to the mass and the charge\ndensities and the asymptotic value of the dilaton. In the case of a degenerate\nhorizon, this number is reduced by one. Our derivation constitutes a\nconstructive proof of the uniqueness theorem for $p$-branes with the\nhomogeneous transverse space. No asymptotically flat solutions with toroidal or\nhyperbolic transverse space within the considered class are shown to exist,\nwhich result can be viewed as a demonstration of the topological censorship for\np-branes.

B/PS bulges are present in\n>45% of highly inclined systems and much work suggests that they are the\nedge-on projection of thick bars. Profiles of the mean stellar velocity V, the\nvelocity dispersion sigma, and the asymmetric (h3) and symmetric (h4)\ndeviations from a Gaussian are presented. Comparing those with N-body bar\ndiagnostics, we find bar signatures in 80% of our sample. B/PS bulge galaxies\ntypically show a double-hump rotation curve with an intermediate dip or\nplateau. They often show a flat central velocity dispersion profile accompanied\nby a secondary peak or plateau and >=40% have a local central sigma minimum.\nThe h3 profiles display up to 3 slope reversals and h3 is normally correlated\nwith V over the presumed bar length, contrary to expectations from axisymmetric\ndisks. Those characteristic bar signatures strengthen the case for a close link\nbetween B/PS bulges and bars. h3 is anti-correlated with V in the very center\nof most galaxies, indicating that they additionally harbor cold and dense\ndecoupled nearly axisymmetric central stellar disks. These coincide with\npreviously identified star-forming ionized-gas disks in the gas-rich systems,\nand we argue that they formed out of gas inflow driven by the bar. As suggested\nby N-body models, h3 appears to be a reliable tracer of asymmetries in disks,\nallowing to discriminate between axisymmetric and barred disks seen in\nprojection. B/PS bulges (and thus a large fraction of all bulges) appear to be\nmade-up mostly of disk material which has acquired a large vertical extent\nthrough bar-driven vertical instabilities. Their formation is thus probably\ndominated by secular evolution processes rather than merging. [Abridged]",

The\nnon-uniform field has a profile with a fixed shape which is designed to\nstabilize a flat interface, and is translated with velocity $v_{e}$. For small\nvelocities the interface is stuck to the profile and is rippled with a\nperiodicity which may be either commensurate or incommensurate with the lattice\nparameter of the square lattice. For a general orientation of the profile, the\nlocal slope of the interface locks in to one of infinitely many rational\ndirections producing a devil's staircase structure. These ``lock-in'' or\ncommensurate structures dissappear as $v_e$ increases through a kinetics driven\ncommensurate - incommensurate transition. For large $v_e$ the interface becomes\ndetached from the field profile and coarsens with Kardar-Parisi-Zang exponents.\nThe complete phase-diagram and the multifractal spectrum corresponding to these\nstructures have been obtained numerically together with several analytic\nresults concerning the dynamics of the rippled phases.

Aiming to test such claims, the kinematic properties of\nself-consistent 3D N-body simulations of bar-unstable disks are studied. Using\nGauss-Hermite polynomials to describe the stellar kinematics, a number of\ncharacteristic bar signatures are identified in edge-on disks: 1) a major-axis\nlight profile with a quasi-exponential central peak and a plateau at moderate\nradii (Freeman Type II profile); 2) a ``double-hump'' rotation curve; 3) a\nsometime flat central velocity dispersion peak with a plateau at moderate radii\nand occasional local central minimum and secondary peak; 4) an h3-V correlation\nover the projected bar length. All those kinematic features are spatially\ncorrelated and can easily be understood from the orbital structure of barred\ndisks. They thus provide a reliable and easy-to-use tool to identify edge-on\nbars. Interestingly, they are all produced without dissipation and are\nincreasingly realized to be common in spirals, lending support to bar-driven\nevolution scenarios for bulge formation. So called ``figure-of-eight''\nposition-velocity diagrams are never observed, as expected for realistic\norbital configurations. Although not uniquely related to triaxiality,\nline-of-sight velocity distributions with a high velocity tail (i.e. an h3-V\ncorrelation) appear as particularly promising tracers of bars. The stellar\nkinematic features identified grow in strength as the bar evolves and vary\nlittle for small inclination variations. Many can be used to trace the bar\nlength. Comparisons with observations are encouraging and support the view that\nboxy and peanut-shaped bulges are simply thick bars viewed edge-on.",

    "summary": "It has long been known that to minimise the heat emitted by a deterministic\ncomputer during it's operation it is necessary to make the computation act in a\nlogically reversible manner\\cite{Lan61}. Such logically reversible operations\nrequire a number of auxiliary bits to be stored, maintaining a history of the\ncomputation, and which allows the initial state to be reconstructed by running\nthe computation in reverse. These auxiliary bits are wasteful of resources and\nmay require a dissipation of energy for them to be reused. A simple procedure\ndue to Bennett\\cite{Ben73} allows these auxiliary bits to be \"tidied\", without\ndissipating energy, on a classical computer. All reversible classical\ncomputations can be made tidy in this way. However, this procedure depends upon\na classical operation (\"cloning\") that cannot be generalised to quantum\ncomputers\\cite{WZ82}. Quantum computations must be logically reversible, and\ntherefore produce auxiliary qbits during their operation. We show that there\nare classes of quantum computation for which Bennett's procedure cannot be\nimplemented. For some of these computations there may exist another method for\nwhich the computation may be \"tidied\". However, we also show there are quantum\ncomputations for which there is no possible method for tidying the auxiliary\nqbits. Not all reversible quantum computations can be made \"tidy\". This\nrepresents a fundamental additional energy burden to quantum computations. This\npaper extends results in \\cite{Mar01}.",

Following this scenario, the massive\nstars of a first stellar generation chemically enrich the globular progenitor\ncloud up to Galactic halo metallicities and sweep it into an expanding\nspherical shell of gas. This paper investigates the ability of this swept\nproto-globular cloud to become gravitationally unstable and, therefore, to seed\nthe formation of second generation stars which may later on form a globular\ncluster. We use a simple model based on a linear perturbation theory for\ntransverse motions in a shell of gas to demonstrate that the pressures by which\nthe progenitor clouds are bound and the supernova numbers required to achieve\nGalactic halo metallicities support the successful development of the shell\ntransverse collapse. Interestingly, the two parameters controling the\nmetallicity achieved through self-enrichment, namely the number of supernovae\nand the external pressure, also rule the surface density of the shell and thus\nits ability to undergo a transverse collapse. Such a supernova-induced origin\nfor the globular cluster stars opens therefore the way to the understanding of\nthe halo metallicity distributions. This model is also able to explain the\nlower limit of the halo globular cluster metallicity.",

A fraction of the thermal radiation from the\npost-shock region may therefore be scattered - and then polarized - before\nescaping the column. Moreover, part of the thermal radiation is reflected - and\nagain polarized - by the White Dwarf surface. We show that X-ray polarimetry\ncan provide valuable, and probably unique informations on the geometry and\nphysical parameters of the accretion column by calculating, by means of Monte\nCarlo simulations, the expected polarization properties of magnetic CVs as a\nfunction of the geometrical parameters (assuming a cylindrical geometry) and\nthe Thomson optical depth of the column.

These\nresults imply that, regardless of the couplings and F-constants chosen, the\nopen moose is not the dual of any QCD-like theory of chiral symmetry breaking.\nWe also show that the generalized sum rules can be \"solved\", leading to a\ncompact expression for the difference of vector- and axial-current correlation\nfunctions. This expression allows for a simple formula for the S parameter\n(L_10), which implies that S is always positive and of order one in any\n(unitary) open linear moose model.

An analysis of\nthe fine structure of VFC suggests the OSS to be a carrier/source of major\nelectrodynamical properties of initial phase of every WS. This implies that the\nmain body of WS may be interpreted as a special type of atmospheric aerosol\ndusty plasma. In such a framework, the WS is considered as the long-lived\nfilament, being formed in electric discharge in the presence of electric and\nmagnetic fields in the course of electric breakdown between the cloud and ocean\nsurface. In this case the charged water aerosol (formed by means of VFC's\ncapillaries in the presence of very powerful electric field) may be an analog\nof a microdust which is lifting upward to the cloud due to effects of\nelectrostatic forces. With such a capillary-electrostatic model of WS, it\nappears possible to interpret many effects related to WS.

However, optical luminosity may not be a good\nindicator of photoionizing luminosity for extremely radio-loud AGNs because the\njets usually contribute significantly to the optical continuum. Therefore, the\nblack hole masses derived for blazar-type AGNs with this method are probably\noverestimated. Here we first derived a tight empirical relation between the BLR\nsize and the H$_\\beta$ emission line luminosity, $R(\\rm{light-days})=\n24.05(L_{H_\\beta}/10^{42} ergs s^{-1})^{0.68}$, from a sample of 34 AGNs with\nthe BLR size estimated with the reverberation mapping technique. Then we\napplied this relation to estimate the black hole masses of some AGNs and found\nthat for many extremely radio-loud AGNs the black hole masses obtained with the\n$R-L_{H_\\beta}$ relation are systematically lower than those derived previously\nwith the $R-L_{5100\\AA}$ relation, while for radio-quiet and slightly\nradio-loud AGNs the results obtained with these two methods are almost the\nsame. The difference of black hole masses estimated with these two relations\nincreases with the radio-loudness for extremely radio-loud AGNs, which is\nconsistent with the fact that their equivalent widths of H$_{\\beta}$ emission\nline become smaller at higher radio-loudness. If the small H$_{\\beta}$\nequivalent widths of extremely radio-loud AGNs are indeed caused by the beaming\neffect, we argue that the optical emission line luminosity may be a better\ntracer of ionizing luminosity for blazar-type AGNs and the black hole mass\nderived with the $R-L_{H_\\beta}$ relation are probably more accurate.",

The geometrical complexity is some\nnatural measure of the amount of distortion of the $n$ times punctured disk\ncaused by a homeomorphism. Our main result is that the two notions of\ncomplexity are comparable. This gives rise to a new combinatorial model for the\nTeichmueller space of an $n+1$ times punctured sphere.

While the stellar\nparameters determined from spectroscopy and photometry usually agree within the\nmutual error bars, the low resolution and S/N of the spectra prevent us from\nsetting constraints stronger than the ones derived from the photometry alone.\nFor the same reasons the white dwarf spectra obtained for NGC 6397\nunfortunately do not provide an independent distance estimate of sufficient\naccuracy to distinguish between the long and short distance scale for globular\nclusters.",

The OSSs differ from the\nformerly found skeletal structures (SS) only by the fact that OSS, in their\ninterior, are filled in with closely packed blocks of a smaller size, up to\nthin capillaries of tens of micron in size. According to suggested hypothesis,\nthe structure-forming dust is produced due to volcanic activity and atmospheric\nelectricity. Such SS may fall on the ocean surface and produce an OSS. This\nidea is supported by the adsorption of air bubbles in the water by the SS to\ngive a partial flotation of SS. In the sea water, various substances in\ndifferent phase states of matter are in touch. This suggests the hypothesis,\nfor the possibility of the action of surface tension even on the blocks of SS\nwhich is immersed in the sea. This phenomenon results in the aggregation of\nblocks deposited from the atmosphere on the ocean's surface, to form eventually\nan OSS. The skeletal structuring assumes that the individual straight and\nrather strong blocks may be joined flexibly, similarly to joints in a skeleton.\nWe make a stress on the phenomenon of OSS's blocks in the form of vertically\noriented floating cylinders because here we suggest the hypothesis that the\nVFC's strength and floating is determined by; a capillary model of an OSS.",

In our design a magnified planar\nimage produced originally by surface plasmons in the metal plane is viewed by a\nregular microscope.

The Serkowski law produces\ngood fits for all the sightlines although the relationship between K and\nlambda(max) may be different from that found in the Galaxy. The results of this\nstudy imply that the slope K/lambda(max) may be significantly larger in M31.\nThe Serkowski curves are significantly narrower than those of the same\nlambda(max) in the Galaxy and may require extreme modifications to the size\ndistributions of silicate particles. The fits for the four sightlines reveal\nvalues of lambda(max) ranging from 4800 to 5500 A. These are consistent with\naverage values of lambda(max) measured in the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds.\nThe range measured for M31 corresponds to R(V) values of 2.7 to 3.1. The range\nin R(V) seen in the Galaxy is 2.5 to 5.5 implying, for this small sample, that\nthe average size ofinterstellar grains in M31 is typically smaller than that\nseen for Galactic grains if the nature of the grains is the same.

Observations were conducted intensively from 1997-1999, with\nbaselines 1995-now,at the Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope, MDM 1.3-meter,\nand Isaac Newton telescopes, totaling about 200 epochs. The two fields cover\n560 square arcmin total, along the minor axis on either side of M31. Candidate\nmicrolensing events are subject to tests to distinguish microlenses from\nvariable stars. Fourprobable microlensing events total, compared to carefully\ncomputed event rate and efficiency models, indicate a marginally significant\nmicrolensing activity above expectations for the stellar lenses alone in M31\n(and the Galaxy) acting as lenses. Maximum likelihood analyses of the event\ndistribution in timescale and across the face of M31 indicates a microlensing\ndark matter halo fraction consistent with that seen in our Galaxy towards the\nLMC (Alcock et al. 2000). For a nearly singular isothermal sphere model, we\nfind a microlensing halo mass fraction f=0.29 +0.30/-0.13 of total dark matter,\nand a poorly constrained lensing component mass 0.02 to 1.5 solar mass, 1 sigma\nlimits).

    "summary": "The 2d gauge theory on the lattice is equivalent to the twisted Eguchi-Kawai\nmodel, which we simulated at N ranging from 25 to 515. We observe a clear large\nN scaling for the 1- and 2-point function of Wilson loops, as well as the\n2-point function of Polyakov lines. The 2-point functions agree with a\nuniversal wave function renormalization. The large N double scaling limit\ncorresponds to the continuum limit of non-commutative gauge theory, so the\nobserved large N scaling demonstrates the non-perturbative renormalizability of\nthis non-commutative field theory. The area law for the Wilson loops holds at\nsmall physical area as in commutative 2d planar gauge theory, but at large\nareas we find an oscillating behavior instead. In that regime the phase of the\nWilson loop grows linearly with the area. This agrees with the Aharonov-Bohm\neffect in the presence of a constant magnetic field, identified with the\ninverse non-commutativity parameter. Next we investigate the 3d \\lambda \\phi^4\nmodel with two non-commutative coordinates and explore its phase diagram. Our\nresults agree with a conjecture by Gubser and Sondhi in d=4, who predicted that\nthe ordered regime splits into a uniform phase and a phase dominated by stripe\npatterns. We further present results for the correlators and the dispersion\nrelation. In non-commutative field theory the Lorentz invariance is explicitly\nbroken, which leads to a deformation of the dispersion relation. In one loop\nperturbation theory this deformation involves an additional infrared divergent\nterm. Our data agree with this perturbative result.",

None\nwas found, as one would expect if the compact X-ray source is a bona fide black\nhole that possesses an event horizon. The X-ray spectrum of J1118 is\nwell-fitted by a simple power-law model. In our search for a thermal component,\nwe fitted our Chandra data to a power-law model (with slope and column density\nfixed) plus a series of nine hydrogen-atmosphere models with radii ranging from\n9/8 to 2.8 Schwarzschild radii. For the more compact models, we included the\nimportant effect of self-irradiation of the atmosphere. Because of the\nextremely low column density to J1118, we obtained very strong limits on a\nhypothetical thermal source: kT(infinity) < 0.011 keV and L(infinity) < 9.4E30\nerg/s (99% confidence level). In analogy with neutron stars, we examine two\npossible sources of thermal radiation from a hypothetical surface of J1118:\ndeep crustal heating and accretion in quiescence. We conclude that if J1118\npossesses a surface composed of normal nuclear matter, we would have detected\nthermal radiation from this surface.

(iii) Full adder is realized in a\nhomogeneous spin chain. (iv) The phase error is minimized: the F-gates generate\napproximately the same phase for different states of the superposition. (v)\nModeling of the full adder is performed using quantum maps instead of\ndifferential equations. This allows us to reduce the calculation time to a\nreasonable value.",

Since the majority of these sources are\nlikely to be z~6 galaxies whose flux decrement between the F775W i'-band and\nF850LP z'-band arises from Lyman-alpha absorption, the number of detected\ncandidates provides a valuable upper limit to the unextincted star formation\nrate at this redshift. We demonstrate that the increased depth of UDF enables\nus to reach an 8-sigma limiting magnitude of z'(AB)=28.5 (equivalent to\n1.5/h{70}^2 M_sun/yr at z=6, or 0.1 L*(UV) for the z~3 U-drop population),\npermitting us to address earlier ambiguities arising from the unobserved form\nof the luminosity function. We identify 54 galaxies (and only one star) at\nz'(AB)<28.5 with (i'-z')>1.3 over the deepest 11arcmin^2 portion of the UDF\nfield. The characteristic luminosity (L*) is consistent with values observed at\nz~3. The faint end slope (alpha) is less well constrained, but is consistent\nwith only modest evolution. The main change appears to be in the number density\n(Phi*). Specifically, and regardless of possible contamination from cool stars\nand lower redshift sources, the UDF data support our previous result that the\nstar formation rate at z~6 was at least x6 LESS than at z~3 (Stanway, Bunker &\nMcMahon 2003). This declining comoving star formation rate (0.005\nh{70}M_sun/yr/Mpc^3 at z~6 for a Salpeter IMF) poses an interesting challenge\nfor models which suggest that L>0.1L* star forming galaxies at z~6 reionized\nthe universe. The\n  short-fall in ionizing photons might be alleviated by galaxies\n  fainter than our limit, or a radically different IMF.\n  Alternatively, the bulk of reionization might have occurred at z>>6.",

It\nwas recently argued and verified to lowest order in a large J=J_1+J_2\nexpansion, that the Heisenberg chain can be described using a non-relativistic\nlow energy effective 2-d action for a unit vector field n_i which exactly\nmatches the corresponding large J limit of the classical AdS_5 x S^5 string\naction. In this paper we show that this agreement extends to the next order and\ndevelop a systematic procedure to compute higher orders in such large angular\nmomentum expansion. This involves several non-trivial steps. On the string\nside, we need to choose a special gauge with a non-diagonal world-sheet metric\nwhich insures that the angular momentum is uniformly distributed along the\nstring, as indeed is the case on the spin chain side. We need also to implement\nan order by order redefinition of the field n_i to get an action linear in the\ntime derivative. On the spin chain side, it turns out to be crucial to include\nthe effects of integrating out short wave-length modes. In this way we gain a\nbetter understanding of how (a subsector of) the string sigma model emerges\nfrom the dual gauge theory, allowing us to demonstrate the duality beyond\ncomparing particular examples of states with large J.",

We thus rebut two\nrecent papers that argue that BH masses obtained from this method are\nunreliable. These papers claim to demonstrate that the range of allowable BH\nmasses derived from a given dataset is artificially too narrow as a result of\nan inadequate number of orbits in the library used to construct dynamical\nmodels. This is an elementary error that is easily avoided. We describe a\nmethod to estimate the number and nature of orbits needed for the library. We\nprovide an example that shows that this prescription is adequate, in the sense\nthat the range of allowable BH masses is not artificially narrowed by use of\ntoo few orbits. A second point raised by critics is that kinematic data are\ngenerally obtained with insufficient spatial resolution to obtain a reliable\nmass. We make the distinction between unreliable determinations and imprecise\nones. We show that there are several different properties of a kinematic\ndataset that can lead to imprecise BH determinations, but none of the\nattributes we have investigated leads to an unreliable determination. In short,\nthe degree to which the BH radius of influence is resolved by spectroscopic\nobservations is already reflected in the BH-mass error envelope, and is not a\nhidden source of error. The BH masses published by our group and the Leiden\ngroup are reliable.",

    "summary": "We report detections of X-rays from HH 80 and HH 81 with the ACIS instrument\non the Chandra X-ray Observatory. These are among the most luminous HH sources\nin the optical and they are now the most luminous known in X-rays. These X-rays\narise from the strong shocks that occur when the southern extension of this\nbipolar outflow slams into the ambient material. There is a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between regions of high X-ray emission and high H? emission. The\nX-ray luminosities of HH 80 and HH 81 are 4.5 and 4.3 x 1031 erg s-1,\nrespectively, assuming the measured low-energy absorption is not in the\nsources. The measured temperature of the HH plasma is not as large as that\nexpected from the maximum velocities seen in the extended tails of the optical\nemission lines. Rather it is consistent with the ~106 K temperature of the\n?narrow? core of the optical lines. There is no observed emission from HH 80\nNorth, the northern extension of the bipolar flow, based upon a measurement of\nlower sensitivity. We imaged the central region of the bipolar flow revealing a\ncomplex of X-ray sources including one near, but not coincident with the\nputative power source in the radio and infrared. This source, CXOPTM\nJ181912.4-204733, has no counterparts at other wavelengths and is consistent in\nluminosity and spectrum with a massive star with AV ~ 90 mag. It may contribute\nsignificantly to the power input to the complex. Alternatively, this emission\nmight be extended X-rays from outflows close to the power source. We detect 94\nX-ray sources overall in this area of star formation.",

The\nBayesian analysis presented in this brief report is restricted to the minimal\nnumber of parameters. Yet it is useful for two reasons. It confirms the results\nof Pogosian et al (2003) using an alternative statistical method. Secondly, it\njustifies the more costly multi-parameter analysis. Already, varying only three\nparameters -- the spectral index and the amplitudes of the adiabatic and string\ncontributions -- we find that the upper bound on the cosmic string contribution\nis of order 10%. We expect that the full multi-parameter study, currently\nunderway, will likely loosen this bound.",

The\ndecay time constant of the preamplifier is 5-times longer than that of the\nTGC-ASD, and some other modifications have been made in order to improve the\nsignal-to-noise ratio of the $\\mu$-PIC. The ASD IC uses SONY Analog Master\nSlice bipolar technology. The IC contains 4 channels in a QFP48 package. The\ndecay time constant of the preamplifier is 80 ns and its gain is approximately\n0.8 V/pC. The output from the preamplifier is received by a shaper\n(main-amplifier) with a gain of 7. A baseline restoration circuit is\nincorporated in the main-amplifier, and the current used for the baseline\nrestoration is 5-times smaller than that of the TGC-ASD. The threshold voltage\nfor the discriminator section is common to the 4 channels and their digital\noutput level is LVDS-compatible. The ASD IC also has an analog output of the\npreamplifier. The equivalent noise charge at the input capacitance of 50 pF is\naround 2000 electrons. The power dissipation with LVDS outputs (100 $\\Omega$\nload) is 57 mW/ch. Using this ASD, the analog output voltage from the signal of\nthe $\\mu$-PIC is about 2-times higher than the case of using the TGC-ASD.As a\nconsequence, the MIPs tracking performance of the Time Projection Chamber (TPC)\nwith the $\\mu$-PIC was improved.The performance of the ASD IC and an improved\ntracking performance of the TPC are reported.",

However, the surveyed area, which\ncorresponds to 55 Mpc x 100 Mpc, was not large enough that we can conclude that\nwe are seeing a typical distribution of z~5 LAEs. In this Letter, we report the\nresults of follow-up imaging of the same sky area using a new narrow-band\nfilter (NB704, lambda_c=7046 A and FWHM=100 A) to detect LAEs at z=4.79, i.e.,\nLAEs lying closer to us by 39 Mpc on average than the z=4.86 objects. We detect\n51 LAEs at z=4.79+-0.04 down to NB704=25.7, and find that their sky\ndistribution is quite different from the z=4.86 LAEs'. The clustering of z=4.79\nLAEs is very weak on any scales and there is no large-scale high- contrast\nstructure. The shape and the amplitude of the angular correlation function are\nthus largely different between the two samples.

    "summary": "The Tycho supernova remnant (SNR), as one of the few historical SNRs, has\nbeen widely studied in various wavebands. Observations show evidence that Tycho\nis expanding in a medium with density gradient and possibly interacting with\ndense ambient medium toward the northeast direction. From the FCRAO CO survey\nof the outer Galaxy, we have identified a patch of molecular clouds in this\narea and have conducted a follow-up observation with Nobeyama 45m radio\ntelescope. The high-resolution (16\\arcsec) Nobeyama data shows that a large\nmolecular cloud surrounds the SNR along the northeastern boundary. We suggest\nthat the Tycho SNR and the molecular cloud are located in the Perseus arm and\nthat the dense medium interacting with the SNR is possibly the molecular cloud.\nWe also discuss the possible connection between the molecular cloud and the\nBalmer-dominated optical filaments, and suggest that the preshock gas may be\naccelerated within the cosmic ray and/or fast neutral precursor.",

Unlike previous studies using galaxy samples, we find that\nwithout Virgo included, roughly ~70% of our dipole signal comes from mass\nconcentrations at large distances (>60 h^-1 Mpc) and does not flatten,\nindicating isotropy in the cluster distribution, until at least 160 h^-1 Mpc.\nWe also present a detailed discussion of our dipole profile, linking observed\nfeatures to the structures and superclusters that produce them.

The analysis is carried out in a wide range of\nzero-$B$ conductances $g$ (measured in units of $e^2/h$), including the range\nof intermediate conductances, $g\\sim 1$. Interpretation of the experimental\nresults obtained for a 2D electron gas in GaAs/In$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$As/GaAs single\nquantum well structures is based on the theory which takes into account terms\nof higher orders in $1/g$, stemming from both the interference contribution and\nthe mutual effect of weak localization (WL) and Coulomb interaction. We\ndemonstrate that at intermediate conductances the negative MR is described by\nthe standard WL \"digamma-functions\" expression, but with a reduced prefactor\n$\\alpha$. We also show that at not very high $g$ the second-loop corrections\ndominate over the contribution of the interaction in the Cooper channel, and\ntherefore appear to be the main source of the lowering of the prefactor,\n$\\alpha\\simeq 1-2/\\pi g$. We further analyze the regime of a \"weak insulator\",\nwhen the zero-$B$ conductance is low $g(B=0)<1$ due to the localization at low\n$T$, whereas the Drude conductance is high, $g_0>>1.$ In this regime, while the\nMR still can be fitted by the digamma-functions formula, the experimentally\nobtained value of the dephasing rate has nothing to do with the true one. The\ncorresponding fitting parameter in the low-$T$ limit is determined by the\nlocalization length and may therefore saturate at $T\\to 0$, even though the\ntrue dephasing rate vanishes.",

If the\nnear-IR excess emission observed from brown dwarfs is indeed due to\ncircumstellar disks, then the large scaleheights we find could have a\nsignificant impact on the optical and near-IR detectability of such systems.\nOur radiation transfer calculations show that such highly flared disks around\nbrown dwarfs will result in a large fraction of obscured sources due to\nextinction of direct starlight by the disk over a wide range of sightlines. The\nobscured fraction for a 'typical' CTTS is less than 20%. We show that the\nobscured fraction for brown dwarfs may be double that for CTTS, but this\ndepends on stellar and disk mass.

    "summary": "We propose a scheme for generation of single 100 GW 300-as pulse in the X-ray\nfree electron laser with the use of a few cycles optical pulse from Ti:sapphire\nlaser system. Femtosecond optical pulse interacts with the electron beam in the\ntwo-period undulator resonant to 800 nm wavelength and produces energy\nmodulation within a slice of the electron bunch. Following the energy modulator\nthe electron beam enters the first part of the baseline gap-adjustable X-ray\nundulator and produces SASE radiation with 100 MW-level power. Due to energy\nmodulation the frequency is correlated to the longitudinal position within the\nfew-cycle-driven slice of the SASE radiation pulse. The largest frequency\noffset corresponds to a single-spike pulse in the time domain which is confined\nto one half-oscillation period near the central peak electron energy. After the\nfirst undulator the electron beam is guided through a magnetic delay which we\nuse to position the X-ray spike with the largest frequency offset at the\n\"fresh\" part of the electron bunch. After the chicane the electron beam and the\nradiation produced in the first undulator enter the second undulator which is\nresonant with the offset frequency. In the second undulator the seed radiation\nat reference frequency plays no role, and only a single (300 as duration) spike\ngrows rapidly. The final part of the undulator is a tapered section allowing to\nachieve maximum output power 100-150 GW in 0.15 nm wavelength range. Attosecond\nX-ray pulse is naturally synchronized with its fs optical pulse which reveals\nunique perspective for pump-probe experiments with sub-femtosecond resolution.",

    "summary": "We confirm the orbital period of WX Cen (WR 48c) determined by Diaz & Steiner\n(1995) and refined its value to P = 0.416 961 5 d. The light curve of this\nobject has an amplitude of 0.32 magnitudes and has a V-shaped narrow minimum,\nsimilar to the ones seen in V Sge, V617 Sgr and in Compact Binary Supersoft\nSources - CBSS. The He II Pickering series decrement shows that the system has\nsignificant amount of hydrogen. The He II 4686 emission lines became weaker\nbetween the 1991 and 2000/2002 observations, indicating distinct levels of\nactivity. The Balmer lines show variable features with V = -2900 km/s in\nabsorption and with V = +/- 3500 km/s in emission. These highly variable events\nremind the satellites in emission of CBSS. We estimate the color excess as\nE(B-V)=0.63. Given the distance-color excess relation in the direction of WX\nCen, this implies a distance of 2.8 kpc. Interstellar absorption of the Na I D\nlines show components at -4.1 km/s, which corresponds to the velocity of the\nCoalsack, and three other components a -23.9, -32.0 and -39.0 km/s. These\ncomponents are also seen with similar strengths in field stars that have\ndistances between 1.8 and 2.7 kpc. The intrinsic color of WX Cen is (B-V)0=-0.2\nand the absolute magnitude, Mv = -0.5. Extended red wings in the strong\nemission lines are seen. A possible explanation is that the system has a\nspill-over stream similar to what is seen in V617 Sgr. We predict that when\nobserved in opposite orbital phase, blue wings would be observed. The velocity\nof the satellite-like feature is consistent with the idea that the central star\nis a white dwarf with a mass of M ~ 0.9 Msun. With the high accretion rate\nunder consideration, the star may become a SN Ia in a time-scale of 5 X 10^6\nyears.",

We demonstrate explicitly that rogue\ntransitions are negligible for low excited-state fractions and\nphotodissociation that is slower than the STIRAP timescale. Moreover, we derive\na reduced-parameter model of collisions, and thereby find that a gain in the\nmolecular conversion efficiency can be obtained by adjusting the atom-atom\nscattering length with off-resonant magnetoassociation. This gain saturates\nwhen the atom-atom scattering length is tuned to a specific fraction of either\nthe molecule-molecule or atom-molecule scattering length.

    "summary": "We present spectral analysis of the Crab Nebula obtained with the {\\it\nChandra} X-ray observatory. The X-ray spectrum is characterized by a power-law\nwhose index varies across the nebula. The variation can be discussed in terms\nof the particle injection from the pulsar in two different directions: the\nequatorial plane containing the torus and the symmetry axis along the jet. In\nthe equatorial plane, spectra within the torus are the hardest, with photon\nindex $\\alpha \\approx 1.9$, and are almost independent of the surface\nbrightness. At the periphery of the torus, the spectrum gradually softens in\nthe outer, lower surface brightness regions, up to $\\alpha \\approx 3.0$. This\nindicates that synchrotron losses become significant to X-ray emitting\nparticles at the outer boundary of the torus. We discuss the nature of the\ntorus, incorporating information from observations at other wavelengths.\nSpectral variations are also seen within the southern jet. The core of the jet\nis the hardest with $\\alpha \\approx$ 2.0, and the outer sheath surrounding the\ncore becomes softer with $\\alpha$ up to 2.5 at the outermost part. Based on the\nsimilarity between the spectra of the jet core and the torus, we suggest that\nthe electron spectra of the particles injected from the pulsar are also similar\nin these two different directions. The brightness ratio between the near and\nfar sides of the torus can be explained by Doppler boosting and relativistic\naberration; however, the observed ratio cannot be derived from the standard\nweakly magnetized pulsar wind model. We also found a site where an optical\nfilament comprised of supernova ejecta is absorbing the soft X-ray emission\n($<$ 2 keV).",

    "summary": "We have carried out a detailed analysis of the IUE archival high resolution\nspectra of the classical nova V1974 Cyg 1992. In addition to the P Cygni and\nemission lines, two shortward shifted absorption systems are present. Evidence\nis given that these absorptions originate in two separate expanding shells,\noutside the wind layers where the emission lines are formed. The outer main\nshell, containing most of the matter ejected at outburst, produces the\nso-called ``principal absorption line system'', and the inner faster moving\nsecond shell produces the so-called ``diffuse--enhanced absorption line\nsystem''. The outflow velocity of the two shells increases exponentially with\ntime reaching a value of about 1750 km/s and 2900 km/s, respectively. We\nsuggest that the acceleration of the shells is the result of increasing\nline-radiation pressure due to the UV-brightening of the star as the effective\nradius decreases. Around day 60 the second shell has overtaken the slower\nmoving principal system shell, and merged with it. This explains: the sudden\ndisappearance of the diffuse line system near that date, the upward jump of 240\nkm/s in velocity of the principal system and the first detection of hard X-ray\nemission on day 63. This velocity jump indicates that the main shell is about 4\ntimes more massive than the second shell. The deceleration suffered by the\ndiffuse-enhanced system after the shock provides a shock temperature of about\n1.6 KeV, in fairly good agreement with the temperature of the observed hard\nX-ray emission.",

Therefore, we show how apparent\nrepulsive interaction can be induced by a combination of attraction to the\ntarget and competitive interactions between axons.

The analysis\nexploits a recently proposed technique that differentiates ultra-high energy\nneutralinos from ultra-high energy neutrinos using their different absorption\nlengths in the Earth's crust. It is shown that for a significant part of the\nparameter space, where the neutralino is mostly a Bino and with squark mass\n$\\sim 1$ TeV, EUSO could see ultra-high energy neutralino events with\nessentially no background. In the energy range 10^9 GeV < E < 10^11 GeV, the\nunprecedented aperture of EUSO makes the telescope sensitive to neutralino\nfluxes as low as 1.1 \\times 10^{-6} (E/GeV)^{-1.3} GeV^{-1} cm^{-2} yr^{-1}\nsr^{-1}, at the 95% CL. Such a hard spectrum is characteristic of supermassive\nparticles' $N$-body hadronic decay. The case in which the flux of ultra-high\nenergy neutralinos is produced via decay of metastable heavy particles with\nuniform distribution throughout the universe is analyzed in detail. The\nnormalization of the ratio of the relics' density to their lifetime has been\nfixed so that the baryon flux produced in the supermassive particle decays\ncontributes to about 1/3 of the events reported by the AGASA Collaboration\nbelow 10^{11} GeV, and hence the associated GeV gamma-ray flux is in complete\nagreement with EGRET data. For this particular case, EUSO will collect between\n4 and 5 neutralino events (with 0.3 of background) in ~ 3 yr of running. NASA's\nplanned mission, the Orbiting Wide-angle Light-collectors (OWL), is also\nbriefly discussed in this context.",

In combination, they\nallow us to determine T_eff to within 50K and gravity to within 0.25 dex. Our\nhigh-resolution analysis does not require extinction estimates. Moroever, it\nyields T_eff and gravities independent of theoretical evolutionary models. We\nfind that our gravities for most of the sample agree remarkably well with the\nisochrone predictions for the likely cluster ages. However, discrepancies\nappear in our coolest targets: these appear to have significantly lower gravity\n(by up to 0.75 dex) than our hotter objects, even though our entire sample\ncovers a relatively narrow range in T_eff (about 300K). This drop in gravity is\nalso implied by inter-comparisons of the data alone, without recourse to\nsynthetic spectra. We consider, and argue against, dust opacity, cool stellar\nspots or metallicity differences leading to the observed spectral effects; a\nreal decline in gravity is strongly indicated. Such gravity variations are\ncontrary to the predictions of the evolutionary tracks, causing improbably low\nages to be inferred from the tracks for our coolest targets. We venture that\nthese results may arise from evolutionary model uncertainties related to\naccretion, deuterium-burning and/or convection effects. Finally, when combined\nwith photometry and distances, our technique for deriving gravities and\ntemperatures provides a way of obtaining masses and radii for substellar\nobjects independent of evolutionary models, as presented in Paper II.",

We now derive extinctions, radii,\nmasses and luminosities by combining our previous results with observed\nphotometry, surface fluxes from the synthetic spectra and the known cluster\ndistances. These are the first mass and radius estimates for young, very low\nmass bodies that are independent of theoretical evolutionary models (though our\nestimates do depend on spectral modeling). We find that for most of our sample,\nour derived mass-radius and mass-luminosity relationships are in very good\nagreement with the theoretical predictions. However, our results diverge from\nthe evolutionary model values for the coolest, lowest-mass targets: our\ninferred radii and luminosities are significantly larger than predicted for\nthese objects at the likely cluster ages, causing them to appear much younger\nthan expected.

Finally, two of our late-M objects\n(USco 128 and 130) appear to have masses close to the deuterium-fusion boundary\n(9--14 Jupiters, within a factor of 2). This conclusion is primarily a\nconsequence of their considerable faintness compared to other targets with\nsimilar extinction, spectral type and temperature (difference of 1 mag). Our\nresult suggests that the faintest young late-M or cooler objects may be\nsignificantly lower in mass than the current theoretical tracks indicate.",

    "summary": "The exact computation of asymptotic quasinormal frequencies is a technical\nproblem which involves the analytic continuation of a Schrodinger-like equation\nto the complex plane and then performing a method of monodromy matching at the\nseveral poles in the plane. While this method was successfully used in\nasymptotically flat spacetime, as applied to both the Schwarzschild and\nReissner-Nordstrom solutions, its extension to non-asymptotically flat\nspacetimes has not been achieved yet. In this work it is shown how to extend\nthe method to this case, with the explicit analysis of Schwarzschild de Sitter\nand large Schwarzschild Anti-de Sitter black holes, both in four dimensions. We\nobtain, for the first time, analytic expressions for the asymptotic quasinormal\nfrequencies of these black hole spacetimes, and our results match previous\nnumerical calculations with great accuracy. We also list some results\nconcerning the general classification of asymptotic quasinormal frequencies in\nd-dimensional spacetimes.",

    "summary": "One of the predictions of quantum gravity phenomenology is that, in\nsituations where Planck-scale physics and the notion of a quantum spacetime are\nrelevant, field propagation will be described by a modified set of laws.\nDescriptions of the underlying mechanism differ from model to model, but a\ngeneral feature is that electromagnetic waves will have non-trivial dispersion\nrelations. A physical phenomenon that offers the possibility of experimentally\ntesting these ideas in the foreseeable future is the propagation of high-energy\ngamma rays from GRB's at cosmological distances. With the observation of\nnon-standard dispersion relations within experimental reach, it is thus\nimportant to find out whether there are competing effects that could either\nmask or be mistaken for this one. In this letter, we consider possible effects\nfrom standard physics, due to electromagnetic interactions, classical as well\nas quantum, and coupling to classical geometry. Our results indicate that, for\ncurrently observed gamma-ray energies and estimates of cosmological parameter\nvalues, those effects are much smaller than the quantum gravity one if the\nlatter is first-order in the energy; some corrections are comparable in\nmagnitude with the second-order quantum gravity ones, but they have a very\ndifferent energy dependence.",

As both heavy ion experiments\nand lattice simulations are now showing, in this region the QGP displays rather\nstrong interactions between the constituents. In this paper we investigate the\nrelationship between four (previously disconnected) lattice results: {\\bf i.}\nspectral densities from MEM analysis of correlators; {\\bf ii.} static quark\nfree energies $F(R)$; {\\bf iii.} quasiparticle masses; {\\bf iv.} bulk\nthermodynamics $p(T)$. We show a high degree of consistency among them not\nknown before. The potentials $V(R)$ derived from $F(R)$ lead to large number of\nbinary bound states, mostly colored, in $gq, qq, gg$, on top of the usual $\\bar\nq q$ mesons. Using the Klein-Gordon equation and ({\\bf ii-iii}) we evaluate\ntheir binding energies and locate the zero binding endpoints on the phase\ndiagram, which happen to agree with ({\\bf i}). We then estimate the\ncontribution of all states to the bulk thermodynamics in agreement with ({\\bf\niv}). We also address a number of theoreticall issues related with to the role\nof the quark/gluon spin in binding at large $\\alpha_s$, although we do not yet\ninclude those in our estimates.

Our models use the rapid single stellar evolution\nalgorithm of Hurley, Pols and Tout for the stellar evolutionary tracks, the\nempirical and semi-empirical calibrated BaSeL-2.0 model of Lejeune, Cuisinier\nand Buser for the library of stellar spectra and the empirical fitting\nfunctions of Worthey, Faber, Gonzalez and Burstein for the Lick/IDS spectral\nabsorption-feature indices.\n  Applying our synthetic Lick/IDS absorption-line indices to the merit\nfunction, we obtain the age and the metallicity of the central region of M32,\nwhich can be well explained by an instantaneous SSP with an age of 6.5 Gyr and\na metallicity similar to solar. Applying the derived age and the metallicity\nfrom the merit function to a number of index-index diagrams, we find that the\nplots of Hbeta-Fe5015 and Hbeta-Fe5782 are the best index-index diagrams from\nwhich we can directly obtain reasonable age and metallicity.",

The hadronic component is dominated by emission from neutral\npions, with a characteristic spectrum symmetric about m_{pi^0}/2. We exploit\nthe well-defined properties of the pion decay spectrum to quantify the maximum\npionic fraction of the observed gamma-ray intensity. We find that the Galactic\nspectrum above 30 MeV can be at most about 50% pionic. The maximum pionic\ncontribution to the extragalactic spectrum is energy dependent; it also depends\non the redshift range over which the sources are distributed, ranging from as\nlow as about 20% for pions generated very recently, to as much as 90% if the\npions are generated around redshift 10. The implications of these constraints\nfor models of gamma-ray and neutrino emission are briefly discussed.",

Such terms lead to a gapped quasiparticle spectrum\nand a nonzero condensate density for all temperatures so that no phase\ntransition occurs. We contrast this to the effect of crystal field anisotropies\nwhich are also induced by spin-orbit coupling. In the second part we study the\nfield-induced magnetic ordering in TlCuCl$_3$ on a quantitative level. We show\nthat the usual BEC picture does not allow for a good description of the\nexperimental magnetisation data and argue that antisymmetric spin interactions\nand/or a staggered $g$ tensor component are still crucial, although both are\nexpected to be tiny in this compound due to crystal symmetries.

    "summary": "A vast class of disordered conducting-insulating compounds close to the\npercolation threshold is characterized by nonuniversal values of transport\ncritical exponents. The lack of universality implies that critical indexes may\ndepend on material properties such as the particular microstructure or the\nnature of the constituents, and that in principle they can be influenced by\nsuitable applied perturbations leading to important informations about the\norigin of nonuniversality. Here we show that in RuO$_2$-glass composites the\nnonuniversal exponent can be modulated by an applied mechanical strain,\nsignaled by a logarithmic divergence of the piezoresistive response at the\npercolation threshold. We interpret this phenomenon as being due to a\ntunneling-distance dependence of the transport exponent, supporting therefore a\ntheory of transport nonuniversality proposed some years ago.",

While the\nvast majority of queries normally execute in seconds or minutes, this\ninteractive execution time can be disproportionately increased by a small\nfraction of queries that take hours or days to run; either because they require\nnon-index scans of the largest tables or because they request very large result\nsets. In response to this, we added a multi-queue job submission and tracking\nsystem. The transfer of very large result sets from queries over the network is\nanother serious problem. Statistics suggested that much of this data transfer\nis unnecessary; users would prefer to store results locally in order to allow\nfurther cross matching and filtering. To allow local analysis, we implemented a\nsystem that gives users their own personal database (MyDB) at the portal site.\nUsers may transfer data to their MyDB, and then perform further analysis before\nextracting it to their own machine.\n  We intend to extend the MyDB and asynchronous query ideas to multiple NVO\nnodes. This implies development, in a distributed manner, of several features,\nwhich have been demonstrated for a single node in the SDSS Batch Query System\n(CasJobs). The generalization of asynchronous queries necessitates some form of\nMyDB storage as well as workflow tracking services on each node and\ncoordination strategies among nodes.",

There is a clear correlation between early star\nformation activity and present-day stellar mass: the more massive galaxies have\nformed about 80% of their stars at $z>1$, while for the less massive ones the\nvalue is only about 20%. By comparing the BCT to the dark matter merger tree,\nwe find indications that star formation efficiency at $z>1$ had to be about a\nfactor of two higher than today ($\\sim 10%$) in galaxies with present-day\nstellar mass larger than $2 \\times 10^{11}M_\\odot$, if this early star\nformation occurred in the main progenitor. Therefore, the LCDM paradigm can\naccommodate a large number of red objects. On the other hand, in galaxies with\npresent-day stellar mass less than $10^{11}$ M$_{\\odot}$, efficient star\nformation seems to have been triggered at $z \\sim 0.2$. We show that there is a\ncharacteristic mass (M$_* \\sim 10^{10}$ M$_{\\odot}$) for feedback efficiency\n(or lack of star formation). For galaxies with masses lower than this, feedback\n(or star formation suppression) is very efficient while for higher masses it is\nnot.

In\nthe first phase of the programme, 22 pointings were used to cover a region of\napproximately three square degrees between 19\\deg -- 22\\deg in Galactic\nlongitude and $\\pm$0.6\\deg in latitude. In total we have resolved over 400\npoint X-ray sources, at $\\geq 5 \\sigma$ significance, down to a flux limit of\n$\\sim2 \\times 10^{-14}$ \\ergseccm (2--10 keV). The combination of the XGPS\nmeasurements in the hard X-ray band with the results from earlier surveys\ncarried out by \\asca and \\chan reveals the form of the low-latitude X-ray\nsource counts over 4 decades of flux. It appears that extragalactic sources\ndominate below $\\sim10^{-13}$ \\ergseccm (2--10 keV), with a predominantly\nGalactic source population present above this flux threshold. The nature of the\nfaint Galactic population observed by \\xmm remains uncertain, although\ncataclysmic variables and RS CVn systems may contribute substantially. \\xmm\nobserves an enhanced surface brightness in the Galactic plane in the 2--6 keV\nband associated with Galactic Ridge X-ray Emission (GRXE). The integrated\ncontribution of Galactic sources plus the breakthrough of extragalactic signal\naccounts for up to 20 per cent of the observed surface brightness. The XGPS\nresults are consistent with the picture suggested from a deep \\chan observation\nin the Galactic plane, namely that the bulk of the GRXE is truly diffuse.",

Potential applications of the TEBD algorithm\nare the simulation of time-dependent Hamiltonians, transport in quantum systems\nfar from equilibrium and dissipative quantum mechanics. In this paper we\ntranslate the TEBD algorithm into the language of matrix product states in\norder to both highlight and exploit its resemblances to the widely used\ndensity-matrix renormalization-group (DMRG) algorithms. The TEBD algorithm\nbeing based on updating a matrix product state in time, it is very accessible\nto the DMRG community and it can be enhanced by using well-known DMRG\ntechniques, for instance in the event of good quantum numbers. More\nimportantly, we show how it can be simply incorporated into existing DMRG\nimplementations to produce a remarkably effective and versatile ``adaptive\ntime-dependent DMRG'' variant, that we also test and compare to previous\nproposals.",

    "summary": "The so called Generalized Chaplygin Gas (GCG) with the equation of state $p =\n- \\frac{A}{{\\rho}^{\\alpha}}$ was recently proposed as a candidate for dark\nenergy in the Universe. In this paper we confront the GCG with SNIa data.\nSpecifically we have tested the GCG cosmology in three different classes of\nmodels with (1) $\\Omega_m= 0.3$, $\\Omega_{Ch}= 0.7$; (2) $\\Omega_m= 0.05$,\n$\\Omega_{Ch}= 0.95$ and (3) $\\Omega_m = 0$, $\\Omega_{Ch} = 1$, as well as the\nmodel withouth any assumption on $\\Omega_m$. The best fitted models are\nobtained by minimalizing the $\\chi^2$ function and $\\chi^2$ levels in the\n$(A_0, \\alpha)$ plane. We supplemented our analysis with confidence intervals\nin the $(A_0, \\alpha)$ plane, as well as one-dimensional probability\ndistribution functions for models parameter. The general conclusion is that\nSNIa data strongly support the Chaplygin gas (with $\\alpha = 1$). Extending our\nanalysisby relaxing the flat prior lead to the result that even though the best\nfitted values of $\\Omega_k$ are formally non-zero, still they are close to flat\ncase. It should be viewed as an advantage of the GCG model since in similar\nanalysisof $\\Lambda$CDM model high negative value of $\\Omega_{k}$ were found to\nbe bestfitted to the data and independent inspiration from CMBR and\nextragalactic astronomy has been invoked to fix the curvature problem. Our\nresults show clearly that in Generalized Chaplygin Gas cosmology distant $z >1$\nsupernovae should be brighter than in $\\Lambda$CDM model.This prediction seems\nto be confirmed with new Riess high redshift SNIa sample. Moreover, we argue\nthat with the future SNAP data it would be possible to differentiate between\nmodels with various value of $\\alpha$ parameter and/or discriminated between\nGCG, Cardassian and $\\Lambda$CDM models",

The analytical model that describes the\nonset of these cycles, which occur on a thermal timescale of the donor star, is\nreexamined. We take into account a contribution of the thermal relaxation which\nis not related to the irradiation of the donor star and which was neglected in\nprevious studies. Cataclysmic variables (CVs) containing extended giant donors\nare more stable than previously thought. CVs close to the upper edge of the\nperiod gap can undergo cycles for low angular momentum loss rates, as they have\nbeen suggested by recent magnetic braking prescriptions, while they are stable\nfor high braking rates. A model for the irradiation geometry that takes into\naccount surface elements near the terminator of the donor star indicates that\npossibly also low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) can undergo mass transfer cycles.\nRegarding the braking rate, which is necessary to drive cycles, basically the\nsame restrictions apply for short period LMXBs as they do for short period CVs.\nWe confirm that LMXBs containing giants can undergo cyles. In terms of an\nirradiation efficiency parameter \\alpha CVs are susceptible to the irradiation\ninstability for \\alpha >= 0.1 while LMXBs are susceptible for \\alpha <= 0.1.\nThe predictions of the analytical model are checked by the first long-term\nevolutionary computations of systems undergoing mass transfer cycles with full\n1D stellar models. For unevolved main sequence (MS) and giant donors the\nanalytic model provides reasonable values for the boundaries of the stable and\nunstable regions while CVs containing highly evolved MS donors are more stable\nat high braking rates than expected.Taking into account irradiation the minimum\nperiod of CVs is increased by up to 1-2 minutes, depending on \\alpha.",

We use a statistical approach, where each\nconfiguration of the contact forces is equally likely. We show that this\nproblem is equivalent to a correlated $q$-model. We find that the response\ndisplays two peaks which lie precisely on the downward lattice directions\nemanating from the point of application of the force. With increasing depth,\nthe magnitude of the peaks decreases, and a central peak develops. On the\nbottom of the pile, only the middle peak persists. The response of different\nsystem sizes exhibits self-similarity.",

Differing from low frequency data,\nnone of our templates presents relevant structures out of the Galactic Plane.\nOur map at 90 GHz suggests that the synchrotron emission at high Galactic\nlatitudes is low enough to allow a robust detection of the $E$--mode component\nof the cosmological signal on large--scale, even in models with\nlow--reionization ($\\tau = 0.05$).

The [FeII]-jet in\nCB230 is defined by a continuous elongated emission feature, superimposed on\nwhich two knots are seen; the brighter one lies at the tip of the jet. The jet\nis oriented in the same direction as the large-scale CO outflow, and emerges\nfrom the nebulosity in which a Young Stellar Object is embedded. The H2\nemission associated with this jet is fainter and wider than the [FeII]\nemission, and is likely coming from the walls of the jet-channel. In CB3 four\nH2 emission knots are found, all towards the blue-shifted lobe of the\nlarge-scale outflow. There is a good correspondence between the location of the\nknots and the blue-shifted SiO(5-4) emission, confirming that SiO emission is\ntracing the jet-like flow rather well. No line emission is found in the other\ntwo targets, CB188 and CB205, although in CB205 faint line emission may have\nbeen hidden in the diffuse nebulosity near the IRAS position.

The study is based on a sample of 30 sources distributed\nalong the IRAS colour-colour diagram. The sources were chosen to trace the\nMiras with thick shells and the whole range of OH/IR stars. The Miras exhibit a\n1665 MHz emission strength comparable to that at 1667 MHz. Even though the\nMiras of the study have quite thick shells, their spectral characteristics in\nboth main lines attest to a strong heterogeneity in their OH shell with, in\nparticular, the presence of significant turbulence and acceleration. The\nexpansion velocity has been found to be about the same at 1665 and 1667 MHz,\ntaking into account a possible velocity turbulence of 1-2km/s at the location\nof the main-line maser emission. An increase in the intensity ratio 1667/1665\nwith shell thickness has been found. A plausible explanation for such a\nphenomenon is that competitive gain in favour of the 1667 MHz line increases\nwhen the shell is getting thicker. There is an evolution in the spectral\nprofile shape with the appearance of a substantial inter-peak signal when the\nshell is getting thicker. Also, inter-peak components are found and can be as\nstrong as the external standard peaks when the shell is very thick. This trend\nfor an increase of the signal in between the two main peaks is thought to be\nthe result of an increase of the saturation with shell thickness. All sources\nbut two - a Mira and an OH/IR star from the lower part of the colour-colour\ndiagram - are weakly polarized.

The results also indicate that for large values of\nthe inclination, the system may be locked in a Kozai resonance.",

Here, we report a\nsystematic effort to search for compact central sources in the remaining 23\nSNRs of this distance limited sample.\n  In this first paper we report Chandra observations of four SNRs. We have\nundertaken a systematic optical/IR identification program of the X-ray sources\ndetected in the field of each SNR. Foreground and background sources have\nidentifiable IR/optical counterparts, while the counterparts of neutron stars\n(or black holes) are expected to be very faint. We are able to account for all\nthe well-detected X-ray sources and thus able to state with some confidence\nthat there are no associated central sources down to a level of one tenth of\nthat of the Cas A central source, L_X <~ 10e31 ergs/s. We compare our limits\nwith cooling curves for neutron stars and find that any putative neutron stars\nin these SNRs must be cooling faster than expected for traditional 1.35 Mo\nneutron stars and that any putative pulsar must have low spin-down\nluminosities, Edot <~ 1e34 ergs/s. However, our limits are unable to constrain\nthe presence or absence of more unusual options, such as relatively more\nmassive neutron stars, neutron stars with exotic interiors, or quiescent black\nholes.

    "summary": "We present a study of variable faint optical sources discovered by comparing\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey\n(POSS) catalogs. We use SDSS measurements to photometrically recalibrate\nseveral publicly available POSS catalogs; a piecewise recalibration in 100\narcmin2 patches generally results in an improvement of photometric accuracy\n(rms) by nearly a factor of two, compared to the original data. The POSS I\nmagnitudes can be improved to ~0.15 mag accuracy, and POSS II magnitudes to\n\\~0.10 mag accuracy. We use the recalibrated catalogs for the ~2,000 deg2 of\nsky in the SDSS Data Release 1 to construct a catalog of ~60,000 sources\nvariable on time scales 10-50 years. A series of statistical tests based on the\nmorphology of SDSS color-color diagrams, as well as visual comparison of images\nand comparison with repeated SDSS observations, demonstrate the robustness of\nthe selection methods. We quantify the distribution of variable sources in the\nSDSS color-color diagrams, and the variability characteristics of quasars. We\ndetect a turn-over in quasar structure function which suggests that the\ncharacteristic time scale for quasar variability is of the order one year. The\nlong-term (>1 year) quasar variability decreases with luminosity and rest-frame\nwavelength similarly to the short-term (<1 year) behavior. We also demonstrate\nthat candidate RR Lyrae stars trace the same halo structures, such as the Sgr\ndwarf tidal stream, that were discovered using repeated SDSS observations. We\nutilize the POSS-SDSS selected candidates to constrain the halo structure in\nthe parts of sky for which repeated SDSS observations do not exist. (abridged)",

The observed flow of 208 distinct features measured in 110 quasars,\nactive galaxies, and BL Lac objects shows highly collimated relativistic motion\nwith apparent transverse velocities typically between zero and about 15c, with\na tail extending up to about 34c. Within individual jets, different features\nappear to move with a similar characteristic velocity which may represent an\nunderlying continuous jet flow, but we also see some stationary and even\napparently inward moving features which co-exist with the main features.\nComparison of our observations with published data at other wavelengths\nsuggests that there is a systematic decrease in apparent velocity with\nincreasing wavelength, probably because the observations at different\nwavelengths sample different parts of the jet structure. The observed\ndistribution of linear velocities is not consistent with any simple ballistic\nmodel. Either there is a rather broad range of Lorentz factors, a significant\ndifference between the velocity of the bulk relativistic flow and the pattern\nspeed of underlying shocks, or a combination of these options. Assuming a\nballistic flow, comparison of observed apparent velocities and Doppler factors\ncomputed from the time scale of flux density variations is consistent with a\nsteep power law distribution of intrinsic Lorentz factors, an isotropic\ndistribution of orientations of the parent population, and intrinsic brightness\ntemperatures about an order of magnitude below the canonical inverse Compton\nlimit.

The imaging data reach a depth of r ~ 22.2 (95%\ncompleteness limit for point sources) and are photometrically and\nastrometrically calibrated to 2% rms and 100 milli-arcsec rms per coordinate,\nrespectively. The imaging data have all been processed through a new version of\nthe SDSS imaging pipeline, in which the most important improvement since the\nlast data release is fixing an error in the model fits to each object. The\nresult is that model magnitudes are now a good proxy for point spread function\n(PSF) magnitudes for point sources, and Petrosian magnitudes for extended\nsources. The spectroscopy extends from 3800 A to 9200 A at a resolution of\n2000. The spectroscopic software now repairs a systematic error in the radial\nvelocities of certain types of stars, and has substantially improved\nspectrophotometry. All data included in the SDSS Early Data Release and First\nData Release are reprocessed with the improved pipelines, and included in the\nSecond Data Release.

To confirm this recent prediction, I apply the same\nstandard quark model with a quark-antiquark annihilation constrained by chiral\nsymmetry. This method also explained with success the repulsive hard core of\nnucleon-nucleon, kaon-nucleon exotic scattering, and the short range attraction\npresent in pion-nucleon and pion-pion non-exotic scattering. I find that\nrepulsion excludes the Xi-- as a dd ss u/bar s-wave pentaquark. I explore the\nXi-- as a heptaquark, equivalent to a N+K+K linear molecule, with positive\nparity and total isospin I=3/2.

The {\\it ab initio} calculated dHvA\nquantities are in good agreement with experimental data for CeCoIn$_5$ and\nCeIrIn$_5$, when we adopt the delocalized LSDA description for the Ce $4f$\nstates.

As a\nresult, the time-dependent upper bound leads us to choose naturally a set of\ninitial vacua for each mode, in which the stringy uncertainty relation is\nsaturated.

The emitted\nthermal infrared light from the planet should show no phase effect assuming the\nplanet is in thermal equilibrium. But the reflected visible light will vary\nversus the phase angle. Here, we study the photometric variation of the\nreflected light versus the orbital phase of a ringed extrasolar planet. We show\nthat a ring around an extrasolar planet, both obviously unresolved, can be\ndetected by its specific photometric signature. A simple quantitative model is\ndiscussed, taking into account the basic optical and geometrical properties of\nthe ringed planet.",

We propose that this trend is a dynamical effect\nresulting from the accumulation of massive stars and stellar-mass black holes\nat the cluster centers. The black holes are remnants of stars with initial\nmasses exceeding 20-25 solar masses; as their orbits decay by dynamical\nfriction, they heat the stellar background and create a core. Using analytical\nestimates and N-body experiments, we show that the sizes of the cores so\nproduced and their growth rates are consistent with what is observed. We\npropose that this mechanism is responsible for the formation of cores in all\nglobular clusters and possibly in other systems as well.",

We discuss the hypothesis\nthat collective behavior in period of crises reinforces the structure of\ncorrelations between stocks, but that it also may have an opposite effect on\nclustering by similar economic sectors. Comparing the crises of 1987 and 2001,\nwe discuss why the expansion of the ellipsoid describing the geometry of the\ndistances in the market, which occurs in the latter period, is not homogeneous\nthrough sectors.

Without stretching force, the chain is wrapped around the core.\nBy applying an external stretching force, unwrapping of the complex is induced.\nWe study the statics and the dynamics of the unwrapping process by computer\nsimulation and simple phenomenological theory. We find two different scenarios\ndepending on the chain stiffness: For a flexible chain, the extension of the\ncomplex scales linearly with the external force applied. The sphere-chain\ncomplex is disordered, i.e. there is no clear winding of the chain around the\nsphere. For a stiff chain, on the other hand, the complex structure is ordered,\nwhich is reminiscent to nucleosome. There is a clear winding number and the\nunwrapping process under external stretching is discontinuous with jumps of the\ndistance-force curve. This is associated to discrete unwinding processes of the\ncomplex.

As another problem,\nwe also study impurity effect on underdoped cuprate as the system showing\npseudogap phenomena. To the aim, we adopt the pairing scenario for the\npseudogap and discuss how pseudogap phenomena affect the reduction of Tc by\nimpurities.

Here, we focus our attention on two features: flow patterns and mass\naccretion ratio, which we define as the ratio of the mass accretion rate onto\nthe companion to the mass loss rate from the mass-losing primary star. We\ncharacterize the flow by the mean normal velocity of wind on the critical Roche\nsurface of the mass-losing star, Vr. When Vr<0.4 A Omega, where A and Omega are\nthe separation between the two stars and the angular orbital frequency of the\nbinary, respectively, we obtain Roche-lobe over-flow (RLOF), while for Vr>0.7 A\nOmega we observe wind accretion.

    "summary": "The magnetisation relaxations of three different types of geometrically\nfrustrated magnetic systems have been studied with the same experimental\nprocedures as previously used in spin glasses. The materials investigated are\nY$_2$Mo$_2$O$_7$ (pyrochlore system), SrCr$_{8.6}$Ga$_{3.4}$O$_{19}$ (piled\npairs of Kagom\\'e layers) and (H$_3$O)Fe$_3$(SO$_4$)$_2$(OH)$_6$ (jarosite\ncompound). Despite a very small amount of disorder, all the samples exhibit\nmany characteristic features of spin glass dynamics below a freezing\ntemperature $T_g$, much smaller than their Curie-Weiss temperature $\\theta$.\nThe ageing properties of their thermoremanent magnetization can be well\naccounted for by the same scaling law as in spin glasses, and the values of the\nscaling exponents are very close. The effects of temperature variations during\nageing have been specifically investigated. In the pyrochlore and the\nbi-Kagom\\'e compounds, a decrease of temperature after some waiting period at a\ncertain temperature $T_p$ re-initializes ageing and the evolution at the new\ntemperature is the same as if the system were just quenched from above $T_g$.\nHowever, as the temperature is raised back to $T_p$, the sample recovers the\nstate it had previously reached at that temperature. These features are known\nin spin glasses as rejuvenation and memory effects. They are clear signatures\nof the spin glass dynamics. In the Kagom\\'e compound, there is also some\nrejuvenation and memory, but much larger temperature changes are needed to\nobserve the effects. In that sense, the behaviour of this compound is\nquantitatively different from that of spin glasses.",

We summarize a new demographic model, the Weon model, and show the\napplication to the demographic data for Switzerland (1876-2002). Particularly,\nthe Weon model simply defines the maximum longevity, which is induced in nature\nby the mortality dynamics. In this study, we reconsider the definition of the\nmaximum longevity and the effectiveness for longevity by the combined effect of\nthe survival and mortality functions. The results suggest that the mortality\nfunction should be zero at the maximum longevity, since the density function is\nzero but the survival function is not zero. Furthermore, the effectiveness for\nlongevity can be maximized at the characteristic life by the complementarity\nbetween the survival and mortality functions, which suggests that there may be\ntwo parts of rectangularization for longevity. The historical trends for\nSwitzerland (1876-2002) implies that there may be a fundamental limiting force\nto restrict the increase of the effectiveness. As a result, it seems that the\ndensity function is essential to define and understand the mortality dynamics,\nthe maximum longevity, the effectiveness for longevity, the paradigm of\nrectangularization and the historical trends of the effectiveness by the\ncomplementarity between the survival and mortality functions.",

We will show that the presence of nodal lines can account for observed\n180 degree phase jumps in drifting subpulses and their otherwise poor phase\nstability, even if the time-like oscillations are strictly periodic. Our model\ncan also account for the \"mode changes\" and \"nulls\" observed in some pulsars as\nquasiperiodic changes between pulsation modes of different l or radial overtone\nn, analogous to pulsation mode changes observed in oscillating white dwarf\nstars. We will discuss other definitive and testable requirements of our model\nand show that they are qualitatively supported by existing data. While\nreserving judgment until the completion of quantitative tests, we are inspired\nenough by the existing observational support for our model to speculate about\nthe excitation mechanism of the non-radial pulsations, the physics we can learn\nfrom them, and their relationship to the period evolution of pulsars.",

    "summary": "The transition from a normal to cancerous cell requires a number of highly\nspecific mutations that affect cell cycle regulation, apoptosis,\ndifferentiation, and many other cell functions. One hallmark of cancerous\ngenomes is genomic instability, with mutation rates far greater than those of\nnormal cells. In microsatellite instability (MIN tumors), these are often\ncaused by damage to mismatch repair genes, allowing further mutation of the\ngenome and tumor progression. These mutation rates may lie near the error\ncatastrophe found in the quasispecies model of adaptive RNA genomes, suggesting\nthat further increasing mutation rates will destroy cancerous genomes. However,\nrecent results have demonstrated that DNA genomes exhibit an error threshold at\nmutation rates far lower than their conservative counterparts. Furthermore,\nwhile the maximum viable mutation rate in conservative systems increases\nindefinitely with increasing master sequence fitness, the semiconservative\nthreshold plateaus at a relatively low value. This implies a paradox, wherein\ninaccessible mutation rates are found in viable tumor cells. In this paper, we\naddress this paradox, demonstrating an isomorphism between the conservatively\nreplicating (RNA) quasispecies model and the semiconservative (DNA) model with\npost-methylation DNA repair mechanisms impaired. Thus, as DNA repair becomes\ninactivated, the maximum viable mutation rate increases smoothly to that of a\nconservatively replicating system on a transformed landscape, with an upper\nbound that is dependent on replication rates. We postulate that inactivation of\npost-methylation repair mechanisms are fundamental to the progression of a\ntumor cell and hence these mechanisms act as a method for prevention and\ndestruction of cancerous genomes.",

In contrast to stability proofs\nbased on energy dissipation,this principle allows to conclude on stability of\nenergy-based systems that are excited by time-varying inputs. In this context,\ncontraction can be regarded as describing new variational conservation laws and\nthe stability of entropy producing processes.",

In particular, the\nearlier quantum ordering solution is found to essentially agree with an\n``improved'' operator ordering given by serially traversing general edge-paths\non a graph in the underlying surface. Now, insofar as Thurston's sphere of\nprojectivized foliations of compact support provides a useful compactification\nfor Teichm\\\"uller space in the classical case, it is natural to consider\ncorresponding limits of appropriate operators to provide a framework for\nstudying degenerations of quantum hyperbolic structures. After surveying the\nrequired background material on Thurston theory and ``train tracks'', the\ncurrent paper continues to give a quantization of Thurston's boundary in the\nspecial case of the once-punctured torus, where there are already substantial\nanalytical and combinatorial challenges. Indeed, an operatorial version of\ncontinued fractions as well as the improved quantum ordering are required to\nprove existence of these limits. Since Thurston's boundary for the\nonce-punctured torus is a topological circle, the main new result may be\nregarded as a quantization of this circle. There is a discussion of quantizing\nThurston's boundary spheres for higher genus surfaces in closing remarks.",

    "summary": "We present Chandra X-ray observations of the young supernova remnant (SNR)\n0509-67.5 in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), believed to be the product of a\nType Ia supernova (SN Ia). The remnant is very round in shape, with a distinct\nclumpy shell-like structure. Our Chandra data reveal the remnant to be rich in\nsilicon, sulfur, and iron. The yields of our fits to the global spectrum\nconfirm that 0509-67.5 is the remnant of an SN Ia and show a clear preference\nfor delayed detonation explosion models for SNe Ia. We study the spectrum of\nthe single brightest isolated knot in the remnant and find that it is enhanced\nin iron by a factor of roughly two relative to the global remnant abundances.\nThis feature, along with similar knots seen in Tycho's SNR, argues for the\npresence of modest small-scale composition inhomogeneities in SNe Ia. The\npresence of both Si and Fe, with abundance ratios that vary from knot to knot,\nindicates that these came from the transition region between the Si- and\nFe-rich zones in the exploded star, possibly as a result of energy input to the\nejecta at late times due to the radioactive decay of 56Ni and 56Co. Two cases\nfor the continuum emission from the global spectrum were modeled: one where the\ncontinuum is dominated by hydrogen thermal bremsstrahlung radiation; another\nwhere the continuum arises from non-thermal synchrotron radiation. The former\ncase requires a relatively large value for the ambient density (~1 cm^-3).\nAnother estimate of the ambient density comes from using the shell structure of\nthe remnant in the context of dynamical models. This requires a much lower\nvalue for the density (<0.05 cm^-3) which is more consistent with other\nevidence known about 0509-67.5. We therefore conclude that the bulk of the\ncontinuum emission from 0509-67.5 has a non-thermal origin.",

If this detection is confirmed and the\ndetection rate turns out to be typical, then the volume averaged ultraviolet\nemissivity must be rising rapidly with increasing redshift. For a magnification\ndue to gravitational lensing by a factor M>25 estimated by Pell'o et al., the\ninferred star formation rate density at z=10 would be about one order of\nmagnitude higher than estimates of the star formation rate density at z=6.\nObjects at z=10 would contribute substantially to the total source counts at\n1.6 micronm and the estimated space density of sources may exceed the space\ndensity of dark matter haloes in a LCDM model. We therefore argue that if\nA1835#1916 is indeed at z=10 then either the magnification factor may have been\noverestimated or the galaxy has a top-heavy initial mass function. Sources with\nthe ultraviolet flux and space density of A1835#1916 may be sufficient to\nreionise most of the diffuse hydrogen in the Universe at z=10. We further use a\ncorrelation between the equivalent width and the redshift of the Ly-alpha\nemission line with respect to the systemic redshift observed in Lyman break\ngalaxies to obtain constraints on the ionisation state of the surrounding\nintergalactic medium (IGM) from the Gunn-Peterson absorption.

In this paper, we show that solving the\nproblem of baryon number violation in non supersymmetric grand unified theories\n(GUT's) in warped higher-dimensional spacetime can lead to a stable\nKaluza-Klein particle. This exotic particle has gauge quantum numbers of a\nright-handed neutrino, but carries fractional baryon-number and is related to\nthe top quark within the higher-dimensional GUT. A combination of baryon-number\nand SU(3) color ensures its stability. Its relic density can easily be of the\nright value for masses in the 10 GeV--few TeV range.

This paper deals with the\nposterior distribution of mutual information, as obtained in a Bayesian\nframework by a second-order Dirichlet prior distribution. The exact analytical\nexpression for the mean, and analytical approximations for the variance,\nskewness and kurtosis are derived. These approximations have a guaranteed\naccuracy level of the order O(1/n^3), where n is the sample size. Leading order\napproximations for the mean and the variance are derived in the case of\nincomplete samples. The derived analytical expressions allow the distribution\nof mutual information to be approximated reliably and quickly. In fact, the\nderived expressions can be computed with the same order of complexity needed\nfor descriptive mutual information. This makes the distribution of mutual\ninformation become a concrete alternative to descriptive mutual information in\nmany applications which would benefit from moving to the inductive side. Some\nof these prospective applications are discussed, and one of them, namely\nfeature selection, is shown to perform significantly better when inductive\nmutual information is used.",

However, magnetic fields of similar intensities and scales to\nthe one in our galaxy, are observed in high redshift galaxies, where a mean\nfield dynamo would not have had enough time to produce the observed fields.\nInstead of a mean field dynamo, we study the emergence of strong large scale\nmagnetic fields in the first objects formed in the universe due to the action\nor a turbulent, helical stochastic dynamo, for redshifts $5 \\leq z \\leq 10$.\nAmbipolar drift plays an important role in this process due to the low level of\nionization of the gas, allowing a large scale stochastic dynamo to operate. We\ntake into account the uncertainties in the physics of high redshift objects by\nexamining a range of values for the parameters that characterize the turbulent\nplasma. By numerically integrating the nonlinear evolution equations for the\nmagnetic field correlations, we show that for reasonable values of the\nparameters in the time interval considered, fields can grow to high intensities\n($\\sim 10^{-6}$ G), with large coherence lengths ($\\sim 2-6$ kpc), essentially\nindependent of the initial values of the magnetic field.",

    "summary": "The structure and dynamics of atomic oxygen adsorbed on Ag(410) and Ag(210)\nsurfaces have been investigated using density functional theory. Our results\nshow that the adsorption configuration in which O adatoms decorate the upper\nside of the (110) steps forming O--Ag--O rows is particularly stable for both\nsurfaces. On Ag(210), this arrangement is more stable than other configurations\nat all the investigated coverages. On Ag(410), adsorption on the terrace and at\nthe step edge are almost degenerate, the former being slightly preferred at low\ncoverage while the latter is stabilized by increasing the coverage. These\nfindings are substantiated by a comparison between the vibrational modes,\ncalculated within density-functional perturbation theory, and the HREEL\nspectrum which has been recently measured in these systems.",

    "summary": "Inflation universally produces classical almost scale free Gaussian\ninhomogeneities of any light scalars. Assuming the coupling constants at the\ntime of inflation depend on some light moduli fields, we encounter the\ngeneration of modulated cosmological fluctuations from (p)reheating. This is an\nalternative mechanism to generate observable (almost) scale free adiabatic\nmetric perturbations. We extend this idea to the class of hybrid inflation,\nwhere the bifurcation value of the inflaton is modulated by the spatial\ninhomogeneities of the couplings. As a result, the symmetry breaking after\ninflation occurs not simultaneously in space but with the time laps in\ndifferent Hubble patches inherited from the long-wavelength moduli\ninhomogeneities. To calculate modulated fluctuations we introduce techniques of\ngeneral relativistic matching conditions for metric perturbations at the time\nhypersurface where the equation of state after inflation undergoes a jump,\nwithout evoking the detailed microscopic physics, as far as it justifies the\njump. We apply this theory to the modulated fluctuations from the hybrid and\nchaotic inflations. We discuss what distinguish the modulated from the\ninflation-driven fluctuations, in particular, their spectral index,\nmodification of the consistency relation and the issue of weak non-Gaussianity.",

One decay (B0 -> M1 M2) receives a significant bbar ->\ndbar penguin contribution. The second (B' -> M1' M2') has a significant bbar ->\nsbar penguin contribution, but is dominated by a single amplitude. CP phase\ninformation is obtained using the fact that the B' -> M1' M2' amplitude is\nrelated by SU(3) to a piece of the B0 -> M1 M2 amplitude. The leading-order\nSU(3)-breaking effect (~25%) responsible for the main theoretical error can be\nremoved. For some decay pairs, it can be written in terms of known decay\nconstants. In other cases, it involves a ratio of form factors. However, this\nform-factor ratio can either be measured experimentally, or eliminated by\nconsidering a double ratio of amplitudes. In all cases, one is left only with a\nsecond-order effect, ~5%. We find twelve pairs of B decays to which this method\ncan be applied. Depending on the decay pair, we estimate the total theoretical\nerror in relating the B' -> M1' M2' and B0 -> M1 M2 amplitudes to be between 5%\nand 15%.

Here we establish conditions under which the Atiyah\nconjecture for a group G implies the Atiyah conjecture for every finite\nextension of G. The most important requirement is that the cohomology\n$H^*(G,\\mathbb{Z}/p)$ is isomorphic to the cohomology of the p-adic completion\nof G for every prime p. An additional assumption is necessary, e.g. that the\nquotients of the lower central series or of the derived series are\ntorsion-free. We prove that these conditions are fulfilled for a class of\ngroups which contains Artin's pure braid groups, free groups, surfaces groups,\ncertain link groups and one-relator groups. Therefore every finite, in fact\nevery elementary amenable extension of these groups satisfies the Atiyah\nconjecture. In the course of the proof we prove that if these extensions are\ntorsion-free, then they have plenty of non-trivial torsion-free quotients which\nare virtually nilpotent. All of this applies in particular to Artin's full\nbraid group, therefore answering question B6 on http://www.grouptheory.info .\nOur methods also apply to the Baum-Connes conjecture.

    "summary": "We first review how to determine the rate of vibrational energy relaxation\n(VER) using perturbation theory. We then apply those theoretical results to the\nproblem of VER of a CD stretching mode in the protein cytochrome c. We model\ncytochrome c in vacuum as a normal mode system with the lowest-order anharmonic\ncoupling elements. We find that, for the ``lifetime'' width parameter $\\gamma=3\n\\sim 30$ cm$^{-1}$, the VER time is $0.2 \\sim 0.3$ ps, which agrees rather well\nwith the previous classical calculation using the quantum correction factor\nmethod, and is consistent with spectroscopic experiments by Romesberg's group.\nWe decompose the VER rate into separate contributions from two modes, and find\nthat the most significant contribution, which depends on the ``lifetime'' width\nparameter, comes from those modes most resonant with the CD vibrational mode.",

Each of these two disciplines is\nnow well represented with respect to most computer science (CS) curricula. But,\nthe two disciplines are practiced almost independently - missing oppurtunities\nto collaborate, coordinate and communicate about the overall design - and\nthereby contributing to system failures. Today, a confluence of several\ningredients contribute to these failures: the increasing importance of the user\ninterface (UI) component in the overall system, the independent maturation of\nthe human computer interaction area, and the lack of a cohesive process model\nto integrate the UI experts' UE development efforts with that of SE. This in\nturn, we believe, is a result of a void in computing curricula: a lack of\neducation and training regarding the importance of communication, collaboration\nand coordination between the SE and UE processes. In this paper we describe the\ncurrent approach to teaching SE and UE and its shortcomings. We identify and\nanalyze the barriers and issues involved in developing systems having\nsubstantial interactive components. We then propose four major themes of\nlearning for a comprehensive computing curriculum integrating SE, UE, and\nsystem architectures in a project environment.",

We initialize the problem with the solution for an aligned,\nconstant angular momentum, accreting thick disk, which is then allowed to\nrespond to the Lense-Thirring precession of the tilted black hole. The\nprecession causes the disk to warp, beginning at the inner edge and moving out\non roughly the Lense-Thirring precession timescale. The propagation of the warp\nstops at a radius in the disk at which other dynamical timescales, primarily\nthe azimuthal sound-crossing time, become shorter than the precession time. At\nthis point, the warp effectively freezes into the disk and the evolution\nbecomes quasi-static, except in cases where the sound-crossing time in the bulk\nof the disk is shorter than the local precession timescale. We see evidence\nthat such disks undergo near solid-body precession after the initial warping\nhas frozen in. Simultaneous to the warping of the disk, there is also a\ntendency for the midplane to align with the symmetry plane of the black hole\ndue to the preferential accretion of the most tilted disk gas. This alignment\nis not as pronounced, however, as it would be if more efficient angular\nmomentum transport (e.g. from viscosity or magneto-rotational instability) were\nconsidered.",

(2001) showed that this objects could not have been a\nnormal member of the scattered disk that had its perihelion distance increased\nby chaotic diffusion. In this paper we explore four seemingly promising\nmechanisms for explaining the origin of the orbit of this peculiar object: (i)\nthe passage of Neptune through a high-eccentricity phase, (ii) the past\nexistence of massive planetary embryos in the Kuiper belt or the scattered\ndisk, (iii) the presence of a massive trans-Neptunian disk at early epochs\nwhich exerted tides on scattered disk objects, and (iv) encounters with other\nstars. Of all these mechanisms, the only one giving satisfactory results is the\npassage of a star. Indeed, our simulations show that the passage of a solar\nmass star at about 800 AU only perturbs objects with semi-major axes larger\nthan roughly 200 AU to large perihelion distances. This is in good agreement\nwith the fact that 2000 CR105 has a semi-major axis of 230AU and no other\nbodies with similar perihelion distances but smaller semi-major axes have yet\nbeen discovered. The discovery of 2003 VB12, (a=450AU, q=75AU) announced a few\ndays before the submission of this paper, strengthen our conclusions.",

Although the pre-quiescent emission satisfies\nthe standard internal shock paradigm, we demonstrate that the post-quiescent\nemission is more consistent with external shocks. We infer that some observed\nsoft, faint, long-lag GRBs are external shocks in which the internal shock\nsignature is not observed. We further note that the peak luminosity ratio\nbetween quiescent episodes is not in agreement with the ratio predicated by the\nlag vs. peak luminosity relationship.

These\nmodulations of around 4 lattice constants occur near vortex cores in samples\nwith and without superconductivity, and in the pseudogap regime of some\nsuperconducting samples. Recently, it was proposed that the origin of the\nmodulations is electronic charge ordered phases intrinsic to doped Mott\ninsulators. We show that even if the system has not charge ordered, proximity\nto such an order will induce modulations at the same ordering wavevector. Such\nmodulations are a signature of the real or incipient order. We construct ground\nstate wavefunctions that include strong fluctuations of the competing order\nwithout having ordered. They exhibit deep roton minima at wavevectors of the\nreciprocal lattice of the incipient order due to proximity to the phase\ntransition into the charge ordered state. Such minima, in turn, produce strong\nmodulations. Moreover, the effects are generic and are present whenever an\nelectronic system is near a crystalline phase. This leads to experimental\nsignatures even if the electronic system has not solidified. The signatures\nwill be ubiquitous near the dopings that stabilize the electronic order.",

In the dual 4D description, these models are 422\ngauge theories in which the apparent unification of gauge couplings in the\nminimal supersymmetric standard model is explained as a consequence of strong\ncoupling in the ultraviolet. The weakness of the gauge couplings at low\nenergies is ensured in this 4D picture by asymptotically non-free contributions\nfrom the conformal sector, which are universal due to an approximate SO(10)\nglobal symmetry. The 422 gauge symmetry is broken to the standard model group\nby a simple set of Higgs fields. An advantage of this setup relative to SU(5)\nmodels of warped unification is that matter is automatically required to fill\nout representations of 422, providing an elegant understanding of the quantum\nnumbers of the standard-model quarks and leptons. The models also naturally\nincorporate the see-saw mechanism for neutrino masses and bottom-tau\nunification.

If correct,\nthe ideas proposed by Hayashi & Matsuda would radically alter our understanding\nof the nature of the angular momentum transport in the disk, which is a central\nfeature of accretion disk theory.

    "summary": "Quantum-mechanical phenomena are playing an increasing role in information\nprocessing, as transistor sizes approach the nanometer level, and quantum\ncircuits and data encoding methods appear in the securest forms of\ncommunication. Simulating such phenomena efficiently is exceedingly difficult\nbecause of the vast size of the quantum state space involved. A major\ncomplication is caused by errors (noise) due to unwanted interactions between\nthe quantum states and the environment. Consequently, simulating quantum\ncircuits and their associated errors using the density matrix representation is\npotentially significant in many applications, but is well beyond the\ncomputational abilities of most classical simulation techniques in both time\nand memory resources. The size of a density matrix grows exponentially with the\nnumber of qubits simulated, rendering array-based simulation techniques that\nexplicitly store the density matrix intractable. In this work, we propose a new\ntechnique aimed at efficiently simulating quantum circuits that are subject to\nerrors. In particular, we describe new graph-based algorithms implemented in\nthe simulator QuIDDPro/D. While previously reported graph-based simulators\noperate in terms of the state-vector representation, these new algorithms use\nthe density matrix representation. To gauge the improvements offered by\nQuIDDPro/D, we compare its simulation performance with an optimized array-based\nsimulator called QCSim. Empirical results, generated by both simulators on a\nset of quantum circuit benchmarks involving error correction, reversible logic,\ncommunication, and quantum search, show that the graph-based approach far\noutperforms the array-based approach.",

The state of a black hole when\nthe quasi-normal modes are excited is called the gravitational ringing, and\ndetections of it will be a direct confirmation of the existence of black holes.\nTo detect it, a method based on matched filtering needs to be developed.\nGenerically, matched filtering requires a large number of templates, because\none has to ensure a proper match of a real gravitational wave with one of\ntemplate waveforms to keep the detection efficiency as high as possible. On the\nother hand, the number of templates must be kept as small as possible under\nlimited computational costs. In our previous paper, assuming that the\ngravitational ringing is dominated by the least-damped (fundamental) mode with\nthe least imaginary part of frequency, we constructed an efficient method for\ntiling the template space. However, the dependence of the template space metric\non the initial phase of a wave was not taken into account. This dependence\narises because of an unavoidable mismatch between the parameters of a signal\nwaveform and those given discretely in the template space. In this paper, we\nproperly take this dependence into account and present an improved, efficient\nsearch method for gravitational ringing of black holes.",

When the average electron number in each dot is a fraction of an\ninteger, quantum interference effect is greatly enhanced because of the sharing\nof extra electrons by multiple dots. We show that if the extra electron (hole)\nnumber is one, the low energy effective Hamiltonian can be map into the\n2-channel SU(M) Coqblin-Schriffer model, where M is the total dot number. In\nparticular, for two-dot system with odd number of total electrons, the model is\nequivalent to a two channel Kondo problem with anisotropic coupling between\nlocal spin and conduction bands. The more general situation with (arbitrary)\nfractional average electron number in each dot is also discussed. To study the\nKondo effect, we apply the self consistent ladder approximation(SCLA) to study\nthe electron spectral function for the two-dot system.

Here we show that\nsuch a non trivial multicritical point exists and is due to the interplay\nbetween the spontaneous breaking of a global U(1) symmetry and the center group\nsymmetry associated to confinement. Our results demonstrate that taking\nconfinement into account is essential for understanding the critical behavior\nas well as the full structure of the phase diagram of adjoint QCD. This is in\ncontrast to ordinary QCD where the center group symmetry associated to\nconfinement is explicitly broken when the quarks are part of the theory.",

    "summary": "The dynamics of vortices in type II superconductors exhibit a variety of\npatterns whose origin is poorly understood. This is partly due to the\nnonlinearity of the vortex mobility which gives rise to singular behavior in\nthe vortex densities. Such singular behavior complicates the application of\nstandard linear stability analysis. In this paper, as a first step towards\ndealing with these dynamical phenomena, we analyze the dynamical stability of a\nfront between vortices and antivortices. In particular we focus on the question\nof whether an instability of the vortex front can occur in the absence of a\ncoupling to the temperature. Borrowing ideas developed for singular bacterial\ngrowth fronts, we perform an explicit linear stability analysis which shows\nthat, for sufficiently large front velocities and in the absence of coupling to\nthe temperature, such vortex fronts are stable even in the presence of in-plane\nanisotropy. This result differs from previous conclusions drawn on the basis of\napproximate calculations for stationary fronts. As our method extends to more\ncomplicated models, which could include coupling to the temperature or to other\nfields, it provides the basis for a more systematic stability analysis of\nnonlinear vortex front dynamics.",

The derived formula\ndetermines the full counting statistics of charge transport, i.e., the\nprobability distribution and all-order cumulants of current noise. It is found\nthat, for asymmetric cavities, in contrast to other mesoscopic systems, the\nthird-order cumulant changes the sign at high biases.

Consider this walk in continuous time starting\nat the identity and let $D_t$ be the minimum number of transpositions needed to\ngo back to the identity from the location at time $t$. $D_t$ undergoes a phase\ntransition: the distance $D_{cn/2} \\sim u(c)n$, where $u$ is an explicit\nfunction satisfying $u(c)=c/2$ for $c \\le 1$ and $u(c)1$. In other words, the\ndistance to the identity is roughly linear during the subcritical phase, and\nafter critical time $n/2$ it becomes sublinear. In addition, we describe the\nfluctuations of $D_{cn/2}$ about its mean in each of the threeregimes\n(subcritical, critical and supercritical).

Cooperation is linked to altruism, the capacity to\nperform costly acts that confer benefits on others. Theoretical approaches had\nso far disregarded costly acts that do not yield future benefits for the\naltruist, either directly or indirectly. Recently, strong reciprocity, i.e.,\nthe predisposition to cooperate with others and to punish non-cooperators at\npersonal cost, has been proposed as a schema for understanding altruism in\nhumans. While behavioral experiments support the existence of strong\nreciprocity, its evolutionary origins remain unclear: group and cultural\nselection are generally invoked to compensate for the negative effects that\nreciprocity is assumed to have on individuals. Here we show, by means of an\nagent-based model inspired on the Ultimatum Game, that selection acting on\nindividuals capable of other-regarding behavior can give rise to strong\nreciprocity. The results, consistent with the existence of neural correlates of\nfairness, are in good agreement with observations on humans and monkeys.",

Method and results: We present a novel strategy for analysing\nprotein-coding sequence by first randomizing the codons used at each position\nwithin the coding sequence, then applying a motif-based machine learning\nalgorithm to compare the true and randomized sequences. This strategy\nidentified a collection of motifs which can successfully discriminate between\nreal and randomized coding sequence, including -- but not restricted to --\nseveral previously reported splice enhancer elements. As well as successfully\ndistinguishing coding exons from randomized sequences, we show that our model\nis able to recognize non-coding exons. Conclusions: Our strategy succeeded in\ndetecting signals in coding exons which seem to be orthogonal to the sequences'\nprimary function of coding for proteins. We believe that many of the motifs\ndetected here may represent binding sites for previously unrecognized proteins\nwhich influence RNA splicing. We hope that this development will lead to\nimproved knowledge of exonic splice enhancers, and new developments in the\nfield of computational gene prediction.",

The mass spectrum of the\nbaryon multiplet is studied. For the meson interaction either the pseudoscalar\nor pseudovector coupling is used. Predictions are compared with the\nexperimental data. Besides these exchanges the influence of excited quark\norbitals on the baryon ground state are considered by performing a multichannel\ncalculation. The nucleon-Delta splitting increases due to the mixing of higher\nquark states while the baryon magnetic momenta decrease. The multichannel\ncalculation with perturbative exchanges is shown to yield reasonable magnetic\nmoments while the mass spectrum is close to experiment.",

The critical linear\nconcentration of carriers above which the quasi one-dimensional gas undergoes a\ncomplete spin depolarization is determined by the Hartree-Fock approximation.\nThe dependence of the critical linear concentration on the concentration of\ncarriers is defined to reveal the interplay of the spin depolarization with the\nevolution of the 0.7 (2e2/h) feature in the quantum conductance staircase from\nthe e2/h to 3/2 (e2/h) values. This dependence is used to study the effect of\nthe hole concentration on the 0.7 (2e2/h) feature in the quantum conductance\nstaircase of the quantum wire prepared inside the p-type silicon quantum well\nusing the split-gate technique. The 1D channel is demonstrated to be\nspin-polarized at the linear concentration of holes lower than the critical\nlinear concentration, because the 0.7 (2e2/h) feature is close to the value of\n0.5 (2e2/h) that indicates the spin degeneracy lifting for the first step of\nthe quantum conductance staircase. The 0.7 (2e2/h) feature is found to take\nhowever its normal magnitude when the linear concentration of holes attains the\ncritical value corresponding to the spin depolarization. The variations in the\nheight of the 0.7 (2e2/h) feature observed in the hole quantum conductance\nstaircase that is revealed by the p-type silicon quantum wire seem to be\nrelated to the evidences of the quantum conductance staircase obtained by\nvarying the concentration of electrons in the 1D channel prepared inside the\nGaAs-AlGaAs heterojunction.",

The star presents eclipses with very different\ndepth: ~1.2 mag in the high and ~3.4 mag in the intermediate state. Eclipse\nmapping reveals that this difference is almost entirely due to the changes in\nthe accretion disc radius: from ~0.5RL1 in the intermediate state to ~0.75RL1\nin the high state (RL1 is the distance from the white dwarf to the first\nLagrangian point). In the intermediate state, the entire disc is eclipsed while\nin the high state, its outer part remains visible. We also find that the\ncentral intensity of the disc is nearly the same in the two luminosity states\nand that it is the increase of the disc radius that is responsible for the\nfinal rise from the 1999/2000 low state. We find that the intensity profile of\nthe disc is rather flat and suggest a possible explanation. We also discuss the\neffect of using a more realistic limb-darkening law on the disc temperatures\ninferred from eclipse mapping experiments. Periodogram analysis of the high\nstate data reveals \"positive superhumps\" with a period of 0.1455 in 2002 and\n0.1461 in 2003, in accord with the results of Patterson et al.

Adaptation can be added to one or several elements in the\nnetwork, while preserving the global synchronization conditions derived in\npreviously. This implies that new nodes can be added to the network without\nprior knowledge of the individual dynamics, and that nodes in an existing\nnetwork have the ability to recover dynamic information if temporarily lost. In\naddition, when the individual elements feature sufficiently rich stable\ndynamics, as e.g. in the case of oscillators, then adaptation actually leads to\nan exact estimation of the unknown parameters. Different kinds of leaders are\nalso discussed in this context - one type of leader can specify overall\ntrajectories for the network, while another can concurrently specify dynamic\nparameters.",

The\nthree AGN are well fitted by absorbed powerlaws, with intrinsic nuclear\nphotoelectric absorption from column densities between 1.3 and 4.0e21 cm-2. In\nthe brightest object the X-ray spectrum is good enough to show that the\nabsorber is not significantly ionized. For all three objects the powerlaw\nslopes appear to be somewhat flatter (Gamma~1.3-1.6) than those found in\ntypical unabsorbed Seyferts. The constraints from optical and X-ray emission\nlines imply that all three objects are Compton-thin. For the two fainter\nobjects, the reddening deduced from the optical broad emission lines in one of\nthem, and the optical continuum in the other, are similar to those expected\nfrom the X-ray absorption, if we assume a Galactic gas-to-dust ratio and\nreddening curve. The broad line region Balmer decrement of our brightest object\nis larger than expected from its X-ray absorption, which can be explained\neither by an intrinsic Balmer decrement with standard gas-to-dust ratio, or by\na >Galactic gas-to-dust ratio. These >=Galactic ratios of extinction to\nphotoelectric absorption cannot extend to the high redshift, high luminosity,\nbroad line AGN in our sample, because they have column densities >1e22 cm-2,\nand so their broad line regions would be totally obscured. This means that some\neffect (e.g., luminosity dependence, or evolution) needs to be present in order\nto explain the whole population of absorbed AGN.",

Therefore, we performed two-dimensional\nhydrodynamical simulations for flat multi-component disks embedded in a stellar\nand dark matter potential. The pressure-free dust component is coupled to the\ngas by a drag force depending on their velocity difference.\n  It turned out that the most unstable regions are those with either a low or\nnear to minimum Toomre parameter or with rigid rotation, i.e. the central area.\nIn that regions the dust-free disks become most unstable for a small range of\nhigh azimuthal modes (m \\sim 8), whereas in dusty disks all modes have similar\namplitudes resulting in a patchy appearance. The structures in the dust have a\nlarger contrast between arm and inter-arm regions than those of the gas. The\ndust peaks are frequently correlated with peaks of the gas distribution, but\nthey do not necessarily coincide with them. This leads to a large scatter in\nthe dust-to-gas ratios. The appearance of the dust is more cellular (i.e.\nsometimes connecting different spiral features), whereas the gas is organized\nin a multi-armed spiral structure.\n  We found that an admixture of 2% dust (relative to the mass of the gas)\ndestabilizes gaseous disks substantially, whereas dust-to-gas ratios below 1%\nhave no influence on the evolution of the gaseous disk. For a high dust-to-gas\nratio of 10% the instabilities reach the saturation level already after 30 Myr.",

According to this unifying dark matter/energy\nscenario, the Universe evolved from an early non-relativistic matter-dominated\nphase to a more recent accelerated expansion phase, driven by a single fluid\ncomponent. Recently, it has been shown that some problems of the quartessence\nmodel, such as the existence of instabilities and oscillations in the matter\npower spectrum, can be avoided if a specific type of intrinsic entropy\nperturbation is considered. In the present article we explore the role of\nskewness in constraining this non-adiabatic scenario.

For d = 7, 8 our\napproach leads to new best known covering lattices. Although we use numerical\nmethods, we made some effort to transform numerical evidences into rigorous\nproofs. We provide rigorous error bounds and prove that some of the new\nlattices are locally optimal.",

We present\nsome of the main results on the statisitcal behavior of such systems. We show\nthat for attractors of three-dimensional flows, robust chaotic behavior is\nequivalent to the existence of certain hyperbolic structures, known as\nsingular-hyperbolicity. These structures, in turn, are associated to the\nexistence of physical measures: \\emph{in low dimensions, robust chaotic\nbehavior for flows ensures the existence of a physical measure}.

For excitation energies\n$\\hbar\\omega\\le12$ meV, we have characterized the magnetic excitations that\nemerge from the incommensurate magnetic superlattice peaks. In the ordered\nstate, these excitations are similar to spin waves. Following these excitations\nas a function of temperature, we find that there is relatively little change in\nthe {\\bf Q}-integrated dynamical spin susceptibility for $\\hbar\\omega\\sim10$\nmeV as stripe order disappears and then as the structure transforms from LTT to\nthe low-temperature-orthorhombic (LTO) phase.

We argue that the\ncontinuous evolution through the transitions provides direct evidence that the\nincommensurate spin excitations in the disordered state are an indicator of\ndynamical charge stripes.

The TONS\nsurvey was constructed to look at the distribution of radio galaxies in a\nregion of moderate (0 < z < 0.5) redshifts by matching NVSS sources with\nobjects in APM catalogues to obtain a sample of optically bright (R < 19.5),\nradio faint (1.4-GHz flux density S_1.4 > 3 mJy) radio galaxies over large\nareas on the sky. We find that redshift spikes, which represent large\nconcentrations of radio galaxies which trace (~ 100 Mpc^3) super-structures are\na common phenomena in these surveys. Under the assumption of quasi-linear\nstructure formation theory and a canonical radio galaxy bias, the structures\nrepresent ~ 4-5 sigma peaks in the primordial density field and their expected\nnumber is low. The most plausible explanation for these low probabilities is an\nincrease in the radio galaxy bias with redshift. To investigate potential\nmechanisms which have triggered the radio activity in these galaxies - and\nhence may account for an increase in the bias of this population, we performed\nimaging studies of the cluster environment of the radio galaxies in\nsuper-structure regions. Preliminary results show that these radio galaxies may\nreside preferentially at the edges of rich clusters.

    "summary": "Recently, combining radial velocities from Keck/HIRES echelle spectra with\npublished proper motion membership probabilities, Cote et al (2002) observed a\nsample of 21 stars, probable members of Palomar 13, a globular cluster in the\nGalactic halo. Their projected velocity dispersion sigma_p = 2.2 +/-0.4 km/s\ngives a mass-to-light ratio M/L_V = 40 +24/-17, about one order of magnitude\nlarger than the usual estimate for globular clusters. We present here radial\nvelocities measured from three different CCD frames of commissioning\nobservations obtained with the new ESO/VLT instrument FLAMES (Fibre Large Array\nMulti Element Spectrograph). From these data, now publicly available, we\nmeasure the homogeneous radial velocities of eight probable members of this\nglobular cluster. A new projected velocity dispersion sigma_p = 0.6-0.9 +/-0.3\nkm/s implies Palomar 13 mass-to-light ratio M/L_V = 3-7, similar to the usual\nvalue for globular clusters. We discuss briefly the two most obvious reasons\nfor the previous unusual mass-to-light ratio finding: binaries, now clearly\ndetected, and more homogeneous data from the multi-fibre FLAMES spectrograph.",

The resonant\nproduction of squarks via a Yukawa coupling lambda' is considered, taking into\naccount direct and indirect R-parity violating decay modes. No evidence for\nsquark production is found in the multi-lepton and multi-jet final state\ntopologies investigated. Mass dependent limits on lambda' are obtained in the\nframework of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. In addition, the\nresults are interpreted in terms of constraints on the parameters of the\nminimal Supergravity model. At the 95% confidence level squarks of all flavours\nwith masses up to 275 GeV are excluded in a large part of the parameter space\nfor a Yukawa coupling of electromagnetic strength. For a coupling strength 100\ntimes smaller, masses up to 220 GeV can be ruled out.",

We argue that this mathematical machinery is hard\nto avoid for a proper understanding of B-branes. A-branes and B-branes are\nrelated in a very complicated and interesting way which ties in with the\n``homological mirror symmetry'' conjecture of Kontsevich. We motivate and\nexploit this form of mirror symmetry. The examples of the quintic 3-fold, flops\nand orbifolds are discussed at some length.

Our model addresses the\nprimary problems of previous phenomenological studies of low-energy\nleptogenesis: a rational for TeV-scale rhd neutrinos with small Yukawa\ncouplings so that the out-of equilibrium condition for $N_i$ decay is\nsatisfied; the origin of the tiny, but non-zero mass splitting required between\nat least two $N_i$ masses; and the necessary non-trivial breaking of flavour\nsymmetries in the rhd neutrino sector. The low mass-scale of the rhd neutrinos\nand their superpartners, and the TeV-scale $A$-terms automatically contained\nwithin the model offer opportunities for partial direct experimental tests of\nthis leptogenesis mechanism at future colliders.",

The calculations are\nperformed on the basis of a soft mean spherical approximation using an\nefficient algorithm for solving the coupled set of the Ornstein-Zernike\nequations, the closure relations, and the external field constraint. The phase\ndiagrams are obtained in the whole thermodynamic space including the magnetic\nfield $H$ for a wide class of Ising fluid models with various ratios $R$ for\nthe strengths of magnetic to nonmagnetic Yukawa-like interactions. The\ninfluence of varying the inverse screening lengths $z_1$ and $z_2$,\ncorresponding to the magnetic and nonmagnetic Yukawa parts of the potential, is\ninvestigated too. It is shown that changes in $R$ as well as in $z_1$ and $z_2$\ncan lead to different topologies of the phase diagrams. In particular,\ndepending on the value of $R$, the critical temperature of the liquid-gas\ntransition either decreases monotonically, behaves nonmonotonically, or\nincreases monotonically with increasing $H$. The para-ferro magnetic transition\nis also affected by changes in $R$ and the screening lengths. At H=0, the Ising\nfluid maps onto a simple model of a symmetric nonmagnetic binary mixture. For\n$H \\to \\infty$, it reduces to a pure nonmagnetic fluid. The results are\ncompared with available simulations and the predictions of other theoretical\nmethods.

    "summary": "According to the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity, curvature and\ntorsion are two equivalent ways of describing the same gravitational field.\nDespite equivalent, however, they act differently: whereas curvature yields a\ngeometric description, in which the concept of gravitational force is absent,\ntorsion acts as a true gravitational force, quite similar to the Lorentz force\nof electrodynamics. As a consequence, the right-hand side of a\nspinless-particle equation of motion (which would represent a gravitational\nforce) is always zero in the geometric description, but not in the teleparallel\ncase. This means essentially that the gravitational coupling prescription can\nbe minimal only in the geometric case. Relying on this property, a new\ngravitational coupling prescription in the presence of curvature and torsion is\nproposed. It is constructed in such a way to preserve the equivalence between\ncurvature and torsion, and its basic property is to be equivalent with the\nusual coupling prescription of general relativity. According to this view, no\nnew physics is connected with torsion, which appears as a mere alternative to\ncurvature in the description of gravitation. An application of this formulation\nto the equations of motion of both a spinless and a spinning particle is made",

The\nstaggered susceptibility and the uniform magnetization are calculated by\ncombining the density-matrix renormalization group method with the interchain\nmean-field theory. For the parameters where the dominant longitudinal\nincommensurate spin correlation appears in the case $J^{\\prime}=0$, the\nstaggered long-range order does not emerge up to a certain critical value of\n$J^{\\prime}$ around the half-magnetization of the saturation. We calculate the\nstatic structure factor in such a parameter region.

These galaxies are the\nfirst two observed from a complete sample of nine radio sources with redshifts\nin the range 1.3 < z < 1.5 (selected from the equatorial sample of powerful\nradio sources of Best, Rottgering & Lehnert), as part of a project aimed to\ninvestigate the multi-component nature of the UV continuum in radio galaxies\nand any variations of the continuum properties with the radio source age.\n  The larger radio source of the two, 0850-206, presents a high continuum\nfractional polarization, averaging 17% across the observed wavelength range and\nreaching 24% at rest-frame wavelengths of <2000 A. The smaller radio source,\n1303+091, shows a lower continuum polarization, averaging 8% and rising to 11%\nfor rest-frame wavelengths >3000 A. For both galaxies, the position angle of\nthe electric vector is generally constant with wavelength and within ~15\ndegrees of perpendicular to the radio axis. Both their total flux spectra and\npolarized flux spectra reveal the 2200 A dust feature, and comparison with dust\nscattering models suggests that the composition of the dust in these galaxies\nis similar to that of Galactic dust. In 0850-206, scattered quasar radiation\ndominates the UV continuum emission, with the nebular continuum accounting for\nno more than ~22% and no requirement for any additional emission component such\nas emission from young stars. By contrast, in 1303+091, unpolarized radiation\ncould be a major constituent of the UV continuum emission, with starlight\naccounting for up to ~50% and the nebular continuum accounting for ~11%.",

The density, lifetime, and orientation rate of the\nelectrically-polarized spins are characterized by a combination of optical and\nelectrical methods. In addition, the dynamics of the current-induced spins are\ninvestigated by utilizing electrical pulses generated from a photoconductive\nswitch.

    "summary": "I review the basic phenomenology and theory of the millisecond brightness\noscillations observed during thermonuclear X-ray bursts from 13 of\napproximately 70 accreting neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries. Compelling\nobservations indicate that the oscillations are produced by surface brightness\npatterns on the rapidly rotating neutron stars. However, it remains to be\nunderstood (1) why the brightness patterns producing them persist for up to 15\ns during an X-ray burst, whereas the burning should cover the entire surface in\nless than 1 s, and (2) why the frequencies drift upward by about 5 Hz during\nthe course of the burst. These peculiarities can probably be explained by\ntaking into account the expansion of the surface layers caused by the burning,\nzonal flows that form due to pressure gradients between the equator and poles,\nand Rossby-Alfven modes that are excited in the surface ocean. Further progress\ntoward understanding how burning progresses on the surface of the neutron star\ncan be made with a next-generation X-ray timing mission, which would provide a\nlarger sample of sources with oscillations, detect sideband signals produced by\nthe spectrum of modes that should be excited in the neutron star ocean, and\nmeasure harmonic structure in the profiles of the oscillations. These\nobservations would be crucial for measuring the distribution of the rotation\nrates of neutron stars, the progression of unstable nuclear burning in the\naccreted ocean, and the curvature of the space-time around the neutron star.",

We consider the regularization with a\ndelta-shell potential. In this case, the coupling constant is uniquely\ndetermined to be a log-periodic function of R with infinite discontinuities,\nand an RG limit cycle is unavoidable. In general, a regularization with an RG\nlimit cycle is selected as the correct renormalization of the 1/r^2 potential\nby the conditions that the cutoff radius R can be made arbitrarily small and\nthat physical observables are reproduced accurately at all energies much less\nthan hbar^2/mR^2.",

Bose Einstein Condensates are superfluids\njust like bosonic Helium is and all interacting bosonic fluids are expected to\nbe at low enough temperatures. One difference between the two systems is that\nsuperfluid Helium exhibits roton excitations while Bose Einstein Condensates\nhave never been observed to have such excitations. The reason for the roton\nminimum in Helium is its proximity to a solid phase. The roton minimum is a\nconsequence of enhanced density fluctuations at the reciprocal lattice vector\nof the stillborn solid. Bose Einstein Condensates in atomic traps are not near\na solid phase and therefore do not exhibit roton minimum. We conclude that if\nBose Einstein Condensates in an optical lattice are tuned near a transition to\na Mott insulating phase, a roton minimum will develop at a reciprocal lattice\nvector of the lattice. Equivalently, a peak in the structure factor will appear\nat such a wavevector. The smallness of the roton gap or the largeness of the\nstructure factor peak are experimental signatures of the proximity to the Mott\ntransition.",

In (2+1) dimensions, in the\nlowest order, SRG produces linear confinement along the transverse direction\nbut only square root confinement along the longitudinal direction and thus\nbreaks the rotational symmetry. In the LFTL approach, we first investigate the\nproblem associated with fermion formulation on a LFTL. When the symmetric\nlattice derivative is used, the doublers arise due to decoupling of even and\nodd sub-lattices. We have discussed Wilson fermion and staggered fermion to\nremove the doublers. We propose another way of formulating fermions on LFTL by\nusing asymmetric lattice derivatives in such a way that the Hermiticity of the\nHamiltonian is preserved. There are no doublers in this method. We also discuss\nthe symmetry relevant for fermion doubling on LFTL. We also compare these two\nmethods of fermion formulations in the context of meson bound state problem in\n(3+1) dimensional QCD with at most one link approximation.",

    "summary": "The inner annular gap (IAG), a new type of inner gap whose magnetic field\nlines intersect the null charge surface (NCS), is proposed to explain\n$\\gamma$-ray and radio emission from pulsars. The IAG can be an important\nsource for high-energy particles. The particles can radiate between the NCS and\nthe IAG. Some observational characteristics in both $\\gamma$-ray and radio\nbands, such as the $\\gamma$-ray emission beams of Crab-like, Vela-like and\nGeminga-like, can be reproduced by numerical method. It is predicted that the\nview angle $\\zeta$ should be larger than the inclination angle\n($\\zeta>\\alpha$), otherwise the $\\gamma$-ray radiation will have little\npossibility to be observed. Whether the inner annular gap (or cap) is sparking\n(or free flow) depends on the surface binding energy of the pulsar. In stead of\nneutron star models, the scenario of the IAG is favorable for bare strange star\nmodels, because bare strange stars can easily satisfy the requisite condition\nto form an IAG for both pulsars ($\\vec{\\Omega}\\cdot \\vec{B}<0$) and\nanti-pulsars ($\\vec\\Omega \\cdot \\vec{B}>0$).",

    "summary": "Natural silicon consists of three stable isotopes with atomic mass 28\n(92.21%), 29 (4.70%) and 30 (3.09%). To present day, isotopic enrichment of Si\nwas used in electronics for two goals: (i) fabrication of substrates with high\nlevel of doping and homogeneous distribution of impurities and (ii) for\nfabrication of substrates with enhanced heat conduction which allows further\nchips miniaturization. For the first purpose, enrichment of Si with Si-30 is\nused, because after irradiation of a Si ingot by the thermal neutron flux in a\nnuclear reactor, this isotope transmutes into a phosphorus atom which is a\ndonor impurity in Si. Enrichment of Si with Si-30 allows one to increase the\nlevel of doping up to a factor of 30 with a high homogeneity of the impurity\ndistribution. The second purpose is achieved in Si highly enriched with isotope\nSi-28, because mono-isotopic Si is characterized by enhanced thermal\nconductivity. New potential of isotopically engineered Si comes to light\nbecause of novel areas of fundamental and applied scientific activity connected\nwith spintronics and a semiconductor-based nuclear spin quantum computer where\nelectron and/or nuclear spins are the object of manipulation. In this case,\ncontrol of the abundance of nuclear spins is extremely important. Fortunately,\nSi allows such a control, because only isotope Si-29 has a non-zero nuclear\nspin. Therefore, enrichment or depletion of Si with isotope Si-29 will lead to\nthe creation of a material with a controlled concentration of nuclear spins.\nTwo examples of nano-devices for spintronics and quantum computation, based on\nisotopically engineered silicon, are discussed.",

A hybrid\nprocedure is adopted: we evolve, in axisymmetry, the linearized equations\ndescribing metric and fluid perturbations, coupled with a nonlinear\nhydrodynamics code that calculates the motion of the accreting matter. The\ninitial matter distribution is shaped in the form of extended quadrupolar\nshells of dust or perfect fluid. Self--gravity and radiation reaction effects\nof the accreting fluid are neglected. This idealized setup is used to\nunderstand the qualitative features appearing in the energy spectrum of the\ngravitational wave emission from compact stars or black holes, subject to\naccretion processes involving extended objects. A comparison for the case of\npoint--like particles falling radially onto black holes is also provided. Our\nresults show that, when the central object is a black hole, the spectrum is far\nfrom having only one clear, monochromatic peak at the frequency of the\nfundamental quasi-normal mode, but it shows a complex pattern, with\ninterference fringes produced by the interaction between the infalling matter\nand the underlying perturbed spacetime: most of the energy is emitted at\nfrequencies lower than that of the fundamental mode of the black hole. Similar\nresults are obtained for extended shells accreting onto neutron stars, but in\nthis case the stellar fundamental mode is clearly excited. Our analysis shows\nthat the gravitational wave signal driven by accretion is influenced more by\nthe details and dynamics of the process, than by the quasi--normal mode\nstructure of the central object.",

    "summary": "Calculations of weak-interaction transition rates and of nuclear formation\nenthalpies show that in isolated neutron stars, the solid phase, above the\nneutron-drip threshold, is amorphous and heterogeneous in nuclear charge. The\nneutrino emissivities obtained are very dependent on the effects of proton\nshell structure but may be several orders of magnitude larger than the electron\nbremsstrahlung neutrino-pair emissivity at temperatures of 10^9 K. In this\nphase, electrical and thermal conductivities are much smaller than for a\nhomogeneous bcc lattice. In particular, the reduced electrical conductivity,\nwhich is also temperature-independent, must have significant consequences for\nthe evolution of high-multipole magnetic fields in neutron stars.",

We show that even the simplest but\nphenomenologically correct modelling of their mutual feedback elucidates the\nmain experimental findings typical for forced longitudinal oscillations of\nsandstone bars, namely, (i) hysteretic behavior of a resonance curve on both\nits up- and down-slopes, (ii) linear softening of resonant frequency with\nincrease of driving level, and (iii) gradual recovery (increase) of resonant\nfrequency at low dynamical strains after the sample was conditioned by high\nstrains. In order to reproduce the highly nonlinear elastic features of\nsandstone grained structure a realistic non-perturbative form of strain\npotential energy was adopted. In our theory slow dynamics associated with the\nexperimentally observed memory of peak strain history is attributed to\nstrain-induced kinetic changes in concentration of ruptured inter-grain and\ninter-lamina cohesive bonds causing a net hysteretic effect on the elastic\nYoung's modulus. Finally, we explain how enhancement of hysteretic phenomena\noriginates from an increase in equilibrium concentration of ruptured cohesive\nbonds that are due to water saturation.",

We conclude that\nthe jets in B2 0326+39 and B2 1553+24 are at angles of 64 +/- 5 deg and 7.7 +/-\n1.3 deg to the line of sight, respectively. In both objects, we find that the\njets decelerate from 0.7 - 0.8c to <0.2c over a distance of approximately 10\nkpc, although in B2 1553+24 this transition occurs much further from the\nnucleus than in B2 0326+39 or 3C 31. The longitudinal emissivity profiles can\nbe divided into sections, each fit accurately by a power law; the indices of\nthese power laws decrease with distance from the nucleus. The magnetic fields\nin both objects are dominated by the longitudinal component in the\nhigh-velocity regions close to the nucleus and by the toroidal component\nfurther out, but B2 0326+39 also has a significant radial component at large\ndistances, whereas B2 1553+24 does not. Simple adiabatic models fail to fit the\nemissivity variations in the regions of high velocity but provide good\ndescriptions of the emissivity after the jets have decelerated. Given the small\nangle to the line of sight inferred for B2 1553+24, there should be a\nsignificant population of similar sources at less extreme orientations. Such\nobjects should have long (>200 kpc), straight, faint jets and we show that\ntheir true sizes are likely to have been underestimated in existing images.\n(Slightly abridged.)",

    "summary": "We propose two hypotheses which characterize the quasi-equilibrium state that\nrealizes after a cold collapse of self-gravitating system. The first hypothesis\nis the linear temperature-mass (TM) relation, which yields a characteristic\nnon-Gaussian velocity distribution. The second is the local virial (LV)\nrelation, which, combining the linear TM relation, determines a unique mass\ndensity profile as $\\rho(r)={\\rho}%_{0}r^{-4}e^{-r_0/r}$. Although this density\nprofile is unphysical in the central region, the region is just inner a few\npercent around the center of a bound region in cumulative mass, which is beyond\nthe resolution of our numerical simulations. Hence posing two hypotheses is\ncompatible to the numerical simulations for almost the whole region of the\nvirialized bound state. Actually, except for this inner part, this density\nprofile fits well to the data of cold collapse simulations. Two families of\nspherical and isotropic models, polytropes and King models, are examined from a\nview point of these two hypotheses. We found that the LV relation imposes a\nstrong constraint on these models: only polytropes with index $n \\sim 5$ such\nas Plummer's model are compatible with the numerical results characterized by\nthe two hypotheses among these models. King models with the concentration\nparameter $% c \\sim 2$ violate the LV relation while they are consistent with\nthe $R^{1/4} $ law for the surface brightness. Hence the above characteristics\ncan serve as a guideline to build up the models for the bound state after a\ncold collapse, besides the conventional criteria concerning the asymptotic\nbehavior.",

The evolution of this\nheterogeneous system is ruled by Griffith's principle which states that a cell\nbreaks when the release in elastic energy in the system exceeds the\nsurface-energy barrier necessary to break the cell. By direct integration over\nall possible realizations of the quenched disorder, we obtain the probability\ndistribution of each damage configuration at any level of the imposed external\ndeformation. We demonstrate an isomorphism between the distributions so\nobtained and standard generalized Ising models, in which the coupling constants\nand effective temperature in the Ising model are functions of the nature of the\nquenched-disorder distribution and the extent of accumulated damage. In\nparticular, we show that damage models with global load sharing are isomorphic\nto standard percolation theory, that damage models with local load sharing rule\nare isomorphic to the standard Ising model, and draw consequences thereof for\nthe universality class and behavior of the autocorrelation length of the\nbreakdown transitions corresponding to these models. We also treat damage\nmodels having more general power-law interactions, and classify the breakdown\nprocess as a function of the power-law interaction exponent.

In this paper we compute the polarized P-Cygni\nline profiles that result from the Hanle effect. For modeling the polarization,\nwe employ a variant of the ``last scattering approximation''. For cases in\nwhich the Sobolev optical depths are greater than unity, the emergent line\nintensity is assumed to be unpolarized; while for smaller optical depths, the\nStokes source functions for the Hanle effect with optically thin line\nscattering are used. For a typical P Cygni line, the polarized emission forms\nin the outer wind, because the Sobolev optical depth is large at the inner\nwind. For low surface field strengths, weak P Cygni lines are needed to measure\nthe circumstellar field. For high values of the surface fields, both the Zeeman\nand Hanle diagnostics can be used, with the Zeeman effect probing the\nphotospheric magnetic fields, and the Hanle effect measuring the magnetic field\nin the wind flow. Polarized line profiles are calculated for a self-consistent\nstructure of the flow and the magnetic geometry based on the WCFields model,\nwhich is applicable to slowly rotating stellar winds with magnetic fields drawn\nout by the gas flow. For surface fields of a few hundred Gauss, we find that\nthe Hanle effect can produce line polarizations in the range of a few tenths of\na percent up to about 2 percent.",

Non-LTE spherically extended\natmosphere models including line-blanketing have been computed with the code\nCMFGEN (Hillier & Miller 1998) and the analysis of UV STIS spectra lead to the\nfollowing results: 1) The SMC-N81 components are young (~ 0-4 Myrs) O stars\nwith Teff compatible with medium to late subtypes and with luminosities lower\nthan average Galactic O dwarfs, rendering them possible ZAMS candidates; 2) The\nwinds are extremely weak: the mass loss rates (~1e-8/1e-9 Msol/yr) and the\nmodified wind momenta are 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower than observed so far\nfor Galactic stars, and are lower than the predictions of the most recent\nhydrodynamical models. The reasons for such weak winds are investigated with\nspecial emphasis on the modified wind momenta: 1) There may be a break-down of\nthe wind momentum - luminosity relation (WLR) for dwarf stars at low luminosity\n(log L/Lsol < 5.5). However, reasons for such a breakdown remain unknown; 2)\nThe slope of the WLR may be steeper at low metallicity. This is predicted by\nthe radiation driven wind theory, but the current hydrodynamical simulations do\nnot show any change of the slope at SMC metallicity. Moreover, there are\nindications that some Galactic objects have wind momenta similar to those of\nthe SMC stars; 3) Decoupling in the atmosphere may lead to multicomponent\nwinds, but various tests indicate that this is not likely to be the case for\nthe SMC-N81 stars. Hence, the origin of the weakness of the wind observed in\nthese objects remains unknown. We suggest that this weakness may be linked with\nthe youth of these stars and represents possibly the onset of stellar winds in\nrecently formed massive stars.",

    "summary": "In this paper we isolate the combinatorial property responsible (at least in\npart) for the computational speedups recently observed in some quantum walk\nalgorithms. We find that continuous-time quantum walks can exploit the covering\nspace property of certain graphs. We demonstrate that a quantum walk on a graph\nY which covers a smaller graph X can be equivalent to a quantum walk on the\nsmaller graph X. This equivalence occurs only when the walk begins on certain\ninitial states, fibre-constant states, which respect the graph covering space\nstructure. We illustrate these observations with walks on Cayley graphs; we\nshow that walks on fibre-constant initial states for Cayley graphs are\nequivalent to walks on the induced Schreier graph. We also consider the problem\nof constructing efficient gate sequences simulating the time evolution of a\ncontinuous-time quantum walk. For the case of the walk on the m-torus graph T^m\non 2^n vertices we construct a gate sequence which uses O(\\poly(n)) gates which\nis independent of the time t the walk is simulated for (and so the sequence can\nsimulate the walk for exponential times). We argue that there exists a wide\nclass of nontrivial operators based on quantum walks on graphs which can be\nmeasured efficiently. We introduce a new general class of computational\nproblems, HiddenCover, which includes a variant of the general hidden subgroup\nproblem as a subclass. We argue that quantum computers ought to be able to\nutilise covering space structures to efficiently solve HiddenCover problems.",

The two solutions oscillating in\nthe origin are treated as asymptotically free particles, which implies that the\nsingular point r=0 in the Schroedinger equation is treated on the same physical\nground as the singular point r=infinity. To make this interpretation possible,\nit is needed that the norm squared of the wave function should diverge when r\ntends to zero, in other words, the measure used in definition of scalar\nproducts should be singular in the origin. Such measure comes into play if the\nSchroedinger equation is written in the form of the generalized (Kamke)\neigenvalue problem for either of two - chosen differently depending on the sign\nof the energy E - operators, other than Hamiltonian.

The model\ninvolves equal numbers of Dp-branes and anti-Dp-branes, and arbitrary angular\nmomenta, and covers the cases p=0,1,2,3,4. The thermodynamic entropy is\nreproduced by the strongly coupled field theory, up to a power of two. The\nstrong-coupling physics of the p=0 case is further developed numerically, using\ntechniques of Kabat, Lifschytz et al.

Furthermore, I show that while symmetries between the spaces exist,\nthe two lattices are not isomorphic.

The blue wing of a Lyman\nalpha line originating at high redshift should be strongly suppressed by\nresonant hydrogen absorption along the line of sight, an expectation borne out\nby the observed asymmetric shapes of the existing sample of Lyman alpha\nemitting sources at lower redshifts (3< z < 6.7). Absorption on the blue side\nof the line of the Pello et al. source could be reduced if the intergalactic\nmedium (IGM) in the vicinity of the galaxy is highly ionized, but we show that\nthis requires an unrealistically high ionizing emissivity. We suggest instead\nthat the Lyman alpha emitting gas be receding relative to the surrounding gas\nwith a velocity of >= 35km/s, a large velocity that is plausible only if the\ngalaxy is part of a larger system (group of galaxies) with a velocity\ndispersion >= 35km/s. We find that with this velocity shift, the observed\nstrength and shape of the line is still consistent with the galaxy being\nsurrounded by its own Stromgren sphere embedded in a fully neutral IGM. More\ngenerally, we predict that at any given redshift, the bright Lyman alpha\nemitters with broader lines would exhibit stronger asymmetry than fainter ones.\nBright galaxies with symmetric Lyman alpha lines may be signposts for groups\nand clusters of galaxies, within which they can acquire random velocities\ncomparable to or larger than their linewidths.",

This sample may include a\nsignificant population of physically distinct ``dark'' or ``faint-afterglow''\nGRBs with different variability properties, or may be composed of a single\npopulation, some of which lack afterglows only because of observational\nselection effects. We argue that the structure function is the most appropriate\nmethod for measuring the variability of bursts because of their transient and\naperiodic nature. We define a simple statistic: the ratio of the integrated\nstructure function from 0.1 to 1 s compared to that from 0.1 to 10 s, as\nmeasured in the observer frame. To avoid instrumental effects we restrict our\nanalysis to GRBs with BATSE data.

We conclude that this result is\ntentative evidence for variations in the properties of GRB progenitors that\naffect both the gamma-ray and afterglow properties of long-duration GRBs. In\naddition, our method of analyzing variability identifies a characteristic\ntimescale of ~1 s, below which variability is suppressed, and finds a trend of\nincreased short timescale variability at higher gamma-ray energies.

This study is motivated by the presence of ~10 young\nmassive stars (M*~3-15 Mo, ~B9V--O8V) less than 0.04 pc from the MBH in the\nGalactic center (GC). Their existence in the extreme environment so close to a\nMBH is a challenge for theories of star formation and stellar dynamics. We show\nthat young stars, which formed far from the MBH and were then scattered into\neccentric orbits, repeatedly cross a cluster of stellar black holes (SBHs),\nwhere they may undergo rare direct 3-body exchanges with a MBH-SBH \"binary\".\nThe interaction between two objects of similar mass ejects the SBH and captures\nthe star on a tight orbit around the MBH. Such captures can naturally explain\ntrends observed in the orbits of the young stars. We derive the capture\ncross-section, validate it by Monte-Carlo simulations, and calculate the number\nof captured stars in the GC using the currently uncertain estimates of the\nnumbers of SBHs inside 0.04 pc and of young stars in the inner few pc of the\nGC. We find that under favorable conditions 3-body exchange can account for\n\\~25% of the observed stars, mostly at the fainter end of the observed range.\nWe discuss additional effects that possibly increase the capture efficiency.\nFuture observations will establish whether there are enough SBHs and young\nstars for exchange captures to singly account for the central young stars. We\nestimate that there are also ~35 lower mass stars (M*~1-3 Mo, ~G2V--A0V) inside\n0.04 pc similarly captured by exchanges with neutron stars. Ongoing replacement\nof compact remnants by main sequence stars may regulate the accumulation of\ncompact remnants near the MBH.",

In\nthis respect, electromagnetic signals constitute another class of penetrating\nradiation. We first propose the study of large mass dileptons induced by the\npassage of high-energy quark jets through quark-gluon plasma. We find that the\nyield due to the jet-plasma interaction gets progressively larger as the\ncollision energy increases: it is slightly less than the Drell-Yan contribution\nat RHIC energies, and it is a factor of 10 larger than Drell-Yan at the LHC. In\na related investigation, we then propose to study dilepton-tagged jets. We\nestimate quantitatively the various background sources, and identify windows\nwhere those are sub-dominant.",

    "summary": "Deformations that conserve the parallelism and the distances --between\nlayers, in smectic phases; between columns, in columnar phases-- are\ncommonplace in liquid crystals. The resulting deformed textures have the same\nmass density as in the ground state (an expected property in a liquid) and are\nat the same time isogonic and isometric, which imposes specific geometric\nfeatures. The corresponding order parameter singularities extend over rather\nlarge, macroscopic, distances, e.g., cofocal conics in smectics. This\nwell-known picture is modified when, superimposed to the 1D or 2D\nperiodicities, the structure is helical. Isogony is no longer the rule, but\nisometry (and mass density) can be preserved. This paper discusses the case of\na medium whose structure is made of 1D modulated layers (a lamello-columnar\nphase), assuming that the modulations rotate helically from one layer to the\nnext. The price to pay is that any isometric texture is necessarily frustrated;\nit consists of layers folded into a set of parallel helicoids, in the manner of\na screw dislocation (of macroscopic Burgers vector), the modulations being\nalong the helices, i.e. double-twisted. The singularity set is made of two\nhelical disclination lines. We complete this geometric analysis by a crude\ncalculation of the energy of a helical ribbon. It is suggested that the helical\nribbons observed in the B7 phase of banana-like molecules are such isometric\ntextures. As a side result, let us mention that the description of\ndouble-twist, traditionally made in terms of a partition of the director field\ninto nested cylinders, could more than often be profitably tested against a\npartition into nested helicoids.",

Since the process has essentially no Standard Model background,\nonce produced, it will provide us with a very clean signature of physics beyond\nthe Standard Model. Moreover, since the final state particles are spinless, the\nspin 2 of the intermediate virtual KK gravitons has to be conserved by the\norbital angular momentum of the Higgs pair. This results in a very\ncharacteristic angular distribution of the final states. Taking into account\nfinite detector acceptance and resolutions as well as initial state radiation\nand beamstrahlung, we demonstrate in this paper that, given a sufficiently high\ncenter of mass energy, the angular distribution of the Higgs pair is indeed\nmeasurable at the linear collider and will allow us to prove the spin 2 nature\nof the KK gravitons exchanged in the s-channel.",

    "summary": "In many applications, and in particular in seismology, realistic propagation\nmedia disperse and attenuate waves. This dissipative behavior can be taken into\naccount by using a viscoacoustic propagation model, which incorporates a\ncomplex and frequency-dependent viscoacoustic modulus in the constitutive\nrelation. The main difficulty then lies in finding an efficient way to\ndiscretize the constitutive equation as it becomes a convolution integral in\nthe time domain. To overcome this difficulty the usual approach consists in\napproximating the viscoacoustic modulus by a low-order rational function of\nfrequency. We use here such an approximation and show how it can be\nincorporated in the velocity-pressure formulation for viscoacoustic waves. This\nformulation is coupled with the fictitious domain method which permit us to\nmodel efficiently diffraction by objects of complicated geometry and with the\nPerfectly Matched Layer Model which allows us to model wave propagation in\nunbounded domains. The space discretization of the problem is based on a mixed\nfinite element method and for the discretization in time a 2nd order centered\nfinite difference scheme is employed. Several numerical examples illustrate the\nefficiency of the method.",

    "summary": "Bloch equations give a quantum description of the coupling between an atom\nand a driving electric force. In this article, we address the asymptotics of\nthese equations for high frequency electric fields, in a weakly coupled regime.\nWe prove the convergence towards rate equations (i.e. linear Boltzmann\nequations, describing the transitions between energy levels of the atom). We\ngive an explicit form for the transition rates. This has already been performed\nin [BFCD03] in the case when the energy levels are fixed, and for different\nclasses of electric fields: quasi or almost periodic, KBM, or with continuous\nspectrum. Here, we extend the study to the case when energy levels are possibly\nalmost degenerate. However, we need to restrict to quasiperiodic forcings. The\ntechniques used stem from manipulations on the density matrix and the averaging\ntheory for ordinary differential equations. Possibly perturbed small divisor\nestimates play a key role in the analysis. In the case of a finite number of\nenergy levels, we also precisely analyze the initial time-layer in the rate\naquation, as well as the long-time convergence towards equilibrium. We give\nhints and counterexamples in the infinite dimensional case.",

This dispersion\nturns out to be important in the frequency range comparable to applied\nvoltages. For comparatively transparent conductors it may lead to the sign\nchange of ${\\cal S}_3$. We also analyze the behavior of the second cumulant of\nthe current operator ${\\cal S}_2$ (current noise) in the presence of\nelectron-electron interactions. In a wide range of parameters we obtain\nexplicit universal dependencies of ${\\cal S}_2$ on temperature, voltage and\nfrequency. We demonstrate that Coulomb interaction decreases the Nyquist noise.\nIn this case the interaction correction to the noise spectrum is governed by\nthe combination $\\sum_nT_n(T_n-1)$, where $T_n$ is the transmission of the\n$n$-th conducting mode. The effect of electron-electron interactions on the\nshot noise is more complicated. At sufficiently large voltages we recover two\ndifferent interaction corrections entering with opposite signs. The net result\nis proportional to $\\sum_nT_n(T_n-1)(1-2T_n)$, i.e. Coulomb interaction\ndecreases the shot noise at low transmissions and increases it at high\ntransmissions.",

    "summary": "We investigate the influence of different magnetic field configurations on\nthe temperature distribution in neutron star crusts. We consider axisymmetric\ndipolar fields which are either restricted to the stellar crust, ``crustal\nfields'', or allowed to penetrate the core, ``core fields''. By integrating the\ntwo-dimensional heat transport equation in the crust, taking into account the\nclassical (Larmor) anisotropy of the heat conductivity, we obtain the crustal\ntemperature distribution, assuming an isothermal core. Including quantum\nmagnetic field effects in the envelope as a boundary condition, we deduce the\ncorresponding surface temperature distributions. We find that core fields\nresult in practically isothermal crusts unless the surface field strength is\nwell above $10^{15}$ G while for crustal fields with surface strength above a\nfew times $10^{12}$ G significant deviations from isothermality occur at core\ntemperatures inferior or equal to $10^8$ K. At the stellar surface, the cold\nequatorial region produced by the quantum suppression of heat transport\nperpendicular to the field in the envelope, present for both core and crustal\nfields, is significantly extended by the classical suppression at higher\ndensities in the case of crustal fields. This can result, for crustal fields,\nin two small warm polar regions which will have observational consequences: the\nneutron star has a small effective thermally emitting area and the X-ray pulse\nprofiles are expected to have a distinctively different shape compared to the\ncase of a neutron star with a core field. These features, when compared with\nX-ray data on thermal emission of young cooling neutron stars, will open a way\nto provide observational evidence in favor, or against, the two radically\ndifferent configurations of crustal or core magnetic fields.",

At the distance of NGC 55, the\nmaximum observed X-ray luminosity of the source, designated as XMMU\nJ001528.9-391319, is L(x) ~ 1.6 x 10^{39} erg/s, placing the object in the\nultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) regime. The X-ray lightcurve exhibits a\nvariety of features including a significant upward drift over the 60 ks\nobservation. Most notably a series of X-ray dips are apparent with individual\ndips lasting for typically 100-300 s. Some of these dips reach almost 100\npercent diminution of the source flux in the 2.0-4.5 keV band. The EPIC CCD\nspectra can be modelled with two spectral components, a very soft powerlaw\ncontinuum (Gamma ~ 4) dominant below 2 keV, plus a multi-colour disc (MCD)\ncomponent with an inner-disc temperature kT ~ 0.8 keV. The observed upperward\ndrift in the X-ray flux can be attributed to an increase in the level of the\nMCD component, whilst the normalisation of the powerlaw continuum remains\nunchanged. The dipping episodes correspond to a loss of signal from both\nspectral components, although the blocking factor is at least a factor two\nhigher for the MCD component. XMMU J001528.9-391319 can be considered as a\ncandidate black-hole binary (BHB) system. A plausible explanation of the\nobserved temporal and spectral behaviour is that we view the accretion disc\nclose to edge-on and that, during dips, orbiting clumps of obscuring material\nenter our line of sight and cause significant blocking or scattering of the\nhard thermal X-rays emitted from the inner disc. In contrast, the more extended\nsource of the soft powerlaw flux is only partially covered by the obscuring\nmatter during the dips.",

The observations give useful\ninformation on the astrophysical parameters of the collapse: in our\nevaluations, the mean energy of electron antineutrinos is <E> =12-16 MeV, the\ntotal energy radiated around (2-3)*1.E53 erg, and there is a hint for a\nrelatively large radiation of non-electronic neutrino species.

The\nmagnitude-redshift relation of recent supernovae Ia measurements is in perfect\nagreement with the prediction of decrease of energy flux in the Weyl models.\nThese data allow to estimate the (ex-ante) spacelike curvature of Weyl\nuniverses. Quasar frequency data from the SDSS provide strong evidence of a\npositive ex-ante curvature. Thus an Einstein-Weyl universe, i.e., an Einstein\nuniverse endowed with a Weylian length connection, is in good agreement with\nsupernovae and quasar data.\n  The relative mass-energy density with respect to the critical density of the\nstandard approach, and the relative contribution of the ``vacuum term'' are\ntime-independent in Weyl gauge. Thus the time-evolution anomaly of vacuum\nenergy does not arise. The intervals given in the literature for the\ndynamically determined matter density parameter are consistent with other data\nin the Weyl geometric approach. An explanation of the cosmic microwave\nbackground by a maximal entropy state of the quantized Maxwell equation,\naccording to a proposal by I.E. Segal for the conformal Einstein universe,\ntranslates directly to the Weyl approach. It leads to quantitative estimations\nfor the temperature of the Planck radiation between 2 and 5.3 deg K.

Subsequent re-examination of early ground based\nobservations revealed that a faint OT was present 6 hours after burst,\nconfirming the source association with GRB 020410. A deep non-detection after\none week requires that the OT re-brightened between day 7 and day 28, and\nfurther late time HST data taken approximately 100 days after burst imply that\nit is very red.We compare both the flux and color of the excess with supernova\nmodels and show that the data are best explained by the presence of a Type Ib/c\nsupernova at a redshift z ~ 0.5, which occured roughly coincident with the day\nof GRB.",

In spite of the high\nextinction to the source and the bright host, a significant increase and\nsubsequent decrease has been detected in the apparent brightness of the host,\npeaking between 10 and 33 days after the GRB. The only convincing explanation\nis a supernova (SN) associated with the XRF, SN2003lw. This is the earliest\ntime at which a SN signal is clearly discernible in a GRB/XRF (apart from\nSN1998bw). SN2003lw is extremely luminous with a broad peak and can be\napproximately represented by the lightcurve of SN1998bw brightened by ~0.55\nmag, implying a hypernova, as observed in most GRB-SNe. The XRF-SN association\nfirmly links XRFs with the deaths of massive stars and further strengthens\ntheir connection with GRBs. The fact that SNe are also associated with XRFs\nimplies that Swift may detect a significant population of intermediate redshift\nSNe very soon after the SN explosions, a sample ideally suited for detailed\nstudies of early SN physics.",

B & R imaging reveals that the inner bulge of UGC10043 is\nelongated perpendicular to the major axis. At larger r, the bulge isophotes\ntwist to become oblate and nearly circular, suggesting the bulge is triaxial.\nBased on stellar and ionized gas kinematics, the bulge shows no clear evidence\nfor rotation about either its major or minor axis. The southwestern quadrant of\nthe bulge is girdled by a narrow dust lane parallel to the minor axis that may\nbe part of an inner polar ring. The stellar disk of UGC10043 has a low optical\nsurface brightness, a small scale height, a mild integral sign warp, and a\ndusty, inner region that appears tilted relative to the outlying disk. The HA\nand [NII] emission lines in UGC10043 resolve into multiple velocity components,\nindicating the presence of a large-scale galactic wind with an outflow velocity\nof ~104 km/s. HA+[NII] imaging reaffirms this picture by revealing ionized gas\nextended to |z|~3.5kpc in a biconical structure. The [NII]/HA line intensity\nratio increases with increasing distance from the plane, reaching values as\nhigh as 1.7. Unlike most galaxies with large-scale winds, UGC10043 has only a\nmodest global star formation rate (~1M_sun/yr), implying the wind is powered by\na rather feeble central starburst. We discuss evolutionary scenarios that could\naccount for both the structural complexities of UGC10043 and its large-scale\nwind. [Abridged]",

The companion has a minimum\nmass of 0.9 M_sun and its nature is presently unclear. After accreting matter\nfrom a low-mass companion star which spun it up to a (few) millisecond spin\nperiod, the pulsar eventually exchanged the low-mass star for its more massive\npresent companion. This is exactly the same process that could form a system\ncontaining a millisecond pulsar and a black hole; the discovery of NGC 1851A\ndemonstrates that such systems might exist in the Universe, provided that\nstellar mass black holes exist in globular clusters.",

It is known that the local density of states is accessible through the\ndifferential conductance measured at the (weakly coupled) third lead. Here, we\nconsider the multiterminal current-current correlations (shot noise and cross\ncorrelations measured at two different terminals). We discuss the dependence of\nthe current correlations on a number of external parameters: bias voltage,\nmagnetic field and magnetization of the leads. When the Kondo resonance is\nsplit by fixing the voltage bias between two leads, the shot noise shows a\nnontrivial dependence on the voltage applied to the third lead. We show that\nthe cross correlations of the current are more sensitive than the conductance\nto the appearance of an external magnetic field. When the leads are\nferromagnetic and their magnetizations point along opposite directions, we find\na reduction of the cross correlations. Moreover, we report on the effect of\ndephasing in the Kondo state for a two-terminal geometry when the third lead\nplays the role of a fictitious voltage probe.",

Although the\nmorphology-density relation, as described by the fraction of early-type (E+S0)\ngalaxies, was in place at z=1, its form differs from that observed at both z=0\nand z=0.5. In the highest density regions the early-type fraction has increased\nsteadily with time from f(E+S0)=0.7+/-0.1 at z=1 to f(E+S0)=0.9+/-0.1 at the\npresent epoch. However, in intermediate density regions corresponding to groups\nand the accretion regions of rich clusters, significant evolution appears to\nbegin only after z=0.5. Finally, at the lowest densities, no evolution is\nobserved for the early-type fraction of field galaxies which remains constant\nat f(E+S0)=0.4+/-0.1 at all epochs. We examine a simple picture consistent with\nthese observations where the early-type population at z=1 is comprised largely\nof elliptical galaxies.

The high luminosities\nat such late times might arise from a relativistic jet viewed substantially\noff-axis that becomes visible only when it turns mildly relativistic and its\nemission is no longer strongly beamed away from us. Alternatively, the emission\nmight originate from the interaction of the SN shell with the circumstellar\nmedium. We find that the latter scenario is hard to reconcile with the observed\nrapid rise in the radio flux and optically thin spectrum,\n$F_\\nu\\propto\\nu^{-0.36\\pm 0.16}t^{1.9\\pm 0.4}$, while these features arise\nnaturally from a misaligned relativistic jet. The high X-ray luminosity\nprovides an independent and more robust constraint -- it requires $\\sim\n10^{51}$ erg in mildly relativistic ejecta. The source should therefore\ncurrently have a large angular size ($\\sim$ 2 mas) which could be resolved in\nthe radio with VLBA. It is also expected to be bipolar and is thus likely to\nexhibit a large degree of linear polarization ($\\sim 10%-20%$). The presence of\na relativistic outflow in SN 2001em would have interesting implications. It\nwould suggest that several percent of SNe Ib/c produce mildly relativistic\njets, with an initial Lorentz factor $\\Gamma_0\\gtrsim 2$, while the fraction\nthat produce GRB jets (with $\\Gamma_0\\gtrsim 100$) is $\\sim 100$ times smaller.\nThis could considerably increase the expected number of transients similar to\norphan GRB afterglows in the radio, and to a lesser extent in the optical and\nX-rays, if there is a continuous distribution in $\\Gamma_0$.

SparsePak itself has throughput >80% redwards\nof 5200 A, and 90-92% in the red. Fed at f/6.3, the cable delivers an output\n90% encircled energy at nearly f/5.2. This has implications for performance\ngains if the WIYN Bench Spectrograph had a faster collimator. Our approach to\nintegral-field spectroscopy yields an instrument which is simple and\ninexpensive to build, yet yields the highest area--solid-angle product per\nspectrum of any system in existence. An Appendix details the fabrication\nprocess in sufficient detail for others to repeat. SparsePak was funded by the\nNational Science Foundation and the University of Wisconsin-Madison Graduate\nSchool, and is now publicly available on the WIYN Telescope through the\nNational Optical Astronomical Observatories.",

    "summary": "We study the possibility of a cool disk existing in the Galactic Center in\nthe framework of the disk-corona evaporation/condensation model. Assuming an\ninactive disk, a hot corona should form above the disk since there is a\ncontinuous supply of hot gas from stellar winds of the close-by massive stars.\nWhether the cool disk can survive depends on the mass exchange between the disk\nand corona. If the disk-corona interaction is dominated by evaporation and the\nrate is larger than the Bondi accretion rate in the Galactic Center, the disk\nwill be depleted within a certain time period and no persistent disk will\nexist. On the other hand, if the interaction results in hot gas steadily\ncondensing into the disk, an inactive cool disk might survive. For this case we\nfurther investigate the Bremsstrahlung radiation from the hot corona and\ncompare it with the observed X-ray luminosity. Our model shows that, for\nstandard viscosity in the corona (alpha=0.3), the mass evaporation rate is much\nhigher than the Bondi accretion rate and the coronal density is much larger\nthan that inferred from Chandra observations. An inactive disk can not survive\nsuch strong evaporation. For small viscosity (alpha<0.07) we find condensation\nsolutions. But detailed computations show that in this case there is too much\nX-ray radiation from the corona to be in agreement with the observations.\nTherefore, we conclude that there should be no thin/inactive disk presently in\nthe Galactic Center. However, we do not exclude that the alternative\nnon-radiative model of Nayakshin (2004) might instead be realized in nature.",

The data are part of the GEMS imaging survey that provides\nhigh resolution optical images obtained with ACS in two bands (F606W and\nF850LP), sampling the rest-frame UV flux of the targets. To deblend the AGN\nimages into nuclear and resolved (host galaxy) components we use a PSF\nsubtraction technique that is strictly conservative with respect to the flux of\nthe host galaxy. We resolve the host galaxies in both filter bands in 9 of the\n23 AGN, whereas the remaining 14 objects are considered non-detections, with\nupper limits of less than 5% of the nuclear flux. However, when we coadd the\nunresolved AGN images into a single high signal-to-noise composite image we\nfind again an unambiguously resolved host galaxy. The recovered host galaxies\nhave apparent magnitudes of 23.0<F606W<26.0 and 22.5<F850LP<24.5 with\nrest-frame UV colours in the range -0.2<(F606W-F850LP)_obs<2.3. The rest-frame\nabsolute magnitudes at 200 nm are -20.0<M_200nm<-22.2. The photometric\nproperties of the composite host are consistent with the individual resolved\nhost galaxies. We find that the UV colors of all host galaxies are\nsubstantially bluer than expected from an old population of stars with\nformation redshift z=5, independent of the assumed metallicities. These UV\ncolours and luminosities range up to the values found for Lyman-break galaxies\n(LBGs) at z=3. Our results agree with the recent discovery of enhanced blue\nstellar light in AGN hosts at lower redshifts. [abridged]",

Very few of the sources exhibit intra-day or inter-month variations. We\nfind that the spectra of the point sources near the Galactic center are very\nhard between 2--8 keV, even after accounting for absorption. When modeled as\npower laws the median photon index is Gamma=0.7, while when modeled as thermal\nplasma we can only obtain lower limits to the temperature of kT>8 keV. The\ncombined spectra of the point sources is similarly hard, with a photon index of\nGamma=0.8. Strong line emission is observed from low-ionization, He-like, and\nH-like Fe, both in the average spectra and in the brightest individual sources.\nThe line ratios of the highly-ionized Fe in the average spectra are consistent\nwith emission from a plasma in thermal equilibrium. This line emission is\nobserved whether average spectra are examined as a function of the count rate\nfrom the source, or as a function of the hardness ratios of individual sources.\nThis suggests that the hardness of the spectra may in fact to due local\nabsorption that partially-covers the X-ray emitting regions in the Galactic\ncenter systems. We suggest that most of these sources are intermediate polars,\nwhich (1) often exhibit hard spectra with prominent Fe lines, (2) rarely\nexhibit either flares on short time scales or changes in their mean X-ray flux\non long time scales, and (3) are the most numerous hard X-ray sources with\ncomparable luminosities in the Galaxy.",

The formula is a simple algebraic expression in $m$, $n$,\n$k$, and $q$. For rank one matrices a complete description of the weight\ndistribution is given and a central limit theorem is proved.",

We find an inverse correlation\nbetween the optical to X-ray flux ratio and the X-ray hardness ratio which can\nbe interpreted as due to obscuration at visible and X-ray wavelengths. We\npresent detailed optical and near-infrared data for a sample of optically-faint\n(R>23) quasars from the EDXS. These are used to constrain the amount of\nrest-frame UV/optical reddening towards these quasars. It is found that\noptically-faint quasars are mostly faint due to obscuration, not because they\nare intrinsically weak. After correcting for reddening, the optical magnitudes\nof most of these quasars are similar to the brighter quasars at these X-ray\nfluxes. Combining with gas column densities inferred from the X-ray\nobservations we consider the gas-to-dust ratios of the obscuring matter. We\nfind that the quasars generally have higher gas-to-dust absorption than that\nseen in the Milky Way - similar to what has been found for nearby Seyfert\ngalaxies. We consider the possible existence of a large population of X-ray\nsources which have optical properties of Type 1 (unobscured) quasars, but X-ray\nproperties of Type 2 (obscured) quasars. We show that the observed distribution\nof optical-to-X-ray flux ratios of quasars at z>1 is skewed to low values\ncompared to the intrinsic distribution...",

    "summary": "The dynamics of a set of rods bouncing on a vertically vibrated plate is\ninvestigated using experiments, simulations, and theoretical analysis. The\nexperiments and simulations are performed within an annulus to impose periodic\nboundary conditions. Rods tilted with respect to the vertical are observed to\nspontaneously develop a horizontal velocity depending on the acceleration of\nthe plate. For high plate acceleration, the rods are observed to always move in\nthe direction of tilt. However, the rods are also observed to move opposite to\ndirection of tilt for a small range of plate acceleration and rod tilt. A phase\ndiagram of the observed motion is presented as a function of plate acceleration\nand the tilt of the rods which is varied by changing the number of rods inside\nthe annulus. Next we introduce a novel molecular dynamics method to simulate\nthe dynamics of the rods using the dimensions and dissipation parameters from\nthe experiments. We reproduce the observed horizontal rod speeds as a function\nof rod tilt and plate acceleration in the simulations. By decreasing the\nfriction between the rods and the base plate to zero in the simulation, we\nidentify the friction during the collision as the crucial ingredient for\noccurrence of the horizontal motion. Guided by the data from the experiments\nand the simulations, we construct a mechanical model for the dynamics of the\nrods in the limit of thin rods. The starting point of the analysis is the\ncollision of a single rod with an oscillating plate. Three friction regimes are\nidentified: slide, slip-stick, and slip reversal. A formula is derived for the\nobserved horizontal velocity as a function of tilt angle. Good agreement for\nthe horizontal velocity as a function of rod tilt and plate acceleration is\nfound between experiments, simulations and theory.",

There are many variants of these fat link\nactions in lattice QCD currently, such as FLIC fermions. The FLIC fermion\nformalism makes use of the APE blocking technique in combination with a\nprojection of the blocked links back into the special unitary group. This\nreunitarisation is often performed using an iterative maximisation of a gauge\ninvariant measure. This technique is not differentiable with respect to the\ngauge field and thus prevents the use of standard Hybrid Monte Carlo simulation\nalgorithms. The use of an alternative projection technique circumvents this\ndifficulty and allows the simulation of dynamical fat link fermions with\nstandard HMC and its variants. The necessary equations of motion for FLIC\nfermions are derived, and some initial simulation results are presented. The\ntechnique is more general however, and is straightforwardly applicable to other\nsmearing techniques or fat link actions.",

Hence, the obtained state of the system is a hybrid\nbetween the Kondo regime, typically associated with single electron occupancy,\nand the mixed valence regime, associated with large charge fluctuations. In the\npresence of a strong magnetic field, we demonstrate that the system is\nequivalent to a two level-level system coupled to an Ohmic bath, with a bias\ncontrolled by the applied magnetic field. Due to the Kondo screening, the\neffect of the magnetic field is significantly suppressed in the singly occupied\nstate.

The HI has\nbeen traced out to a radius R~8R_25 or 48 disc scale-lengths, making it one of\nthe largest HI extents reported (800\" or 12.6kpc at the assumed distance of\n3.3Mpc). Approximately 75% of the HI resides in a doughnut which is seen close\nto face-on and the optical galaxy fits snugly within the hole of the doughnut.\nThe remaining 25% of the neutral gas is found in an annulus concentric with the\ndoughnut and with a somewhat larger ellipticity. A total HI mass of 1.52 x 10^8\nMsol is found, which implies an M(HI)/L_B = 0.22 in solar units. We argue that\nmost if not all of this gas is of external origin, most likely due to the\nmerger of a dwarf irregular galaxy with M_B ~ -15.5mag.\n  The velocity field shows a steeply declining observed rotation curve,\ncompatible with Keplerian decline. However, because the galaxy is close to\nface-on there is a degeneracy in the determination of the intrinsic rotation\ncurve and inclination. We therefore analysed two extreme cases, producing\ntilted-ring model fits forcing either a Keplerian or a Flat rotation curve\nthrough the observations; both approaches result in equally plausible fits.\n  Assuming a distance of 3.3Mpc, a total mass of 3 x 10^10 Msol is found on the\nbasis of the Keplerian rotation curve. This implies a global M/L_B ratio of ~44\nin solar units which is high and likely a reflection of the low blue luminosity\nof the galaxy (~15 times lower than the average S0 luminosity). Values for a\nFlat rotation curve are a factor of 4 higher.",

The strength of this\nsignature is dependent on the source spectrum and flux impinging on the disk\nsurface, and is thus very sensitive to the system geometry. The general\nweakness of this feature in the hard state has been attributed to either a\ntruncation of the thin disk, large ionization, or beaming of the corona region\naway from the disk with \\beta~0.3. This latter velocity is comparable to jet\nnozzle velocities, so we explore whether a jet can account for the observed\nreflection fractions. It has been suggested that jets may contribute to the\nhigh-energy spectra of X-ray binaries, via either synchrotron from around\n100-1000 r_g along the jet axis or from inverse Compton (synchrotron\nself-Compton and/or external Compton) from near the base. Here we calculate the\nreflection fraction from jet models wherein either synchrotron or Compton\nprocesses dominate the emission. Using as a guide a data set for GX 339-4,\nwhere the reflection fraction previously has been estimated as ~10%, we study\nthe results for a jet model. We find that the synchrotron case gives < 2%\nreflection, while a model with predominantly synchrotron self-Compton in the\nbase gives ~10-18%. This shows for the first time that an X-ray binary jet is\ncapable of significant reflection fractions, and that extreme values of the\nreflection may be used as a way of discerning the dominant contributions to the\nX-ray spectrum.",

    "summary": "Magnetic, transport, and x-ray diffraction measurements of ferromagnetic\nshape memory alloy Ni$_{2.16}$Mn$_{0.84}$Ga revealed that this alloy undergoes\nan intermartensitic transition upon cooling, whereas no such a transition is\nobserved upon subsequent heating. The difference in the modulation of the\nmartensite forming upon cooling from the high-temperature austenitic state\n[5-layered (5M) martensite], and the martensite forming upon the\nintermartensitic transition [7-layered (7M) martensite] strongly affects the\nmagnetic and transport properties of the alloy and results in a large thermal\nhysteresis of the resistivity $\\rho$ and magnetization $M$. The\nintermartensitic transition has an especially marked influence on the transport\nproperties, as is evident from a large difference in the resistivity of the 5M\nand 7M martensite, $(\\rho_{\\mathrm{5M}} - \\rho_{\\mathrm{7M}})/\\rho\n_{\\mathrm{5M}} \\approx 15%$, which is larger than the jump of resistivity at\nthe martensitic transition from the cubic austenitic phase to the monoclinic 5M\nmartensitic phase. We assume that this significant difference in $\\rho$ between\nthe martensitic phases is accounted for by nesting features of the Fermi\nsurface. It is also suggested that the nesting hypothesis can explain the\nuncommon behavior of the resistivity at the martensitic transition, observed in\nstoichiometric and near-stoichiometric Ni-Mn-Ga alloys.",

Systematic analysis on the ground state of two-dimensional electrons in\nthe lowest Landau level shows that the transition from the stripe state to the\nliquid state at v=3/8 is caused by a reduction of repulsive interaction around\nr=3. The same reduction of the interaction also stabilizes the incompressible\nliquid states at v=1/3 and 2/5, which shows a similarity between the two liquid\nstates at v=3/8 and 1/3.

The\ncontribution of continuous representations is proportional to the space-time\nvolume and is divergent in the infinite-volume limit while the part of discrete\nrepresentations is volume-independent.\n  In order to see clearly the contribution of discrete representations we\nconsider elliptic genus which projects out the contributions of continuous\nrepresentations: making use of the SL(2;R)/U(1), we compute elliptic genera for\nvarious non-compact space-times such as the conifold, ALE spaces, Calabi-Yau\n3-folds with A_n singularities etc. We find that these elliptic genera in\ngeneral have a complex modular property and are not Jacobi forms as opposed to\nthe cases of compact Calabi-Yau manifolds.",

The\nsupersonic turbulence ubiquitously observed in Galactic molecular gas generates\nstrong density fluctuations with gravity taking over in the densest and most\nmassive regions. Collapse sets in to build up stars and star clusters.\n  Turbulence plays a dual role. On global scales it provides support, while at\nthe same time it can promote local collapse. Stellar birth is thus intimately\nlinked to the dynamical behavior of parental gas cloud, which determines when\nand where protostellar cores form, and how they contract and grow in mass via\naccretion from the surrounding cloud material to build up stars. Slow,\ninefficient, isolated star formation is a hallmark of turbulent support,\nwhereas fast, efficient, clustered star formation occurs in its absence.\n  The fact that Galactic molecular clouds are highly filamentary can be\nexplained by a combination of compressional flows and shear. The dynamical\nevolution of nascent star clusters is very complex. This strongly influences\nthe stellar mass spectrum. The equation of state (EOS) plays a pivotal role in\nthe fragmentation process. Under typical cloud conditions, massive stars form\nas part of dense clusters. However, for gas with effective polytropic index\ngreater than unity star formation becomes biased towards isolated massive\nstars, which may be of relevance for understanding Pop III stars.",

The characteristics of the radiation passing through\nthe treatment helmets are analysed in detail. We have found that only primary\nparticles emitted from the source with polar angles smaller than 3$^{\\rm o}$\nwith respect to the beam axis are relevant for the dosimetry of the Gamma\nKnife. The photons trajectories reaching the output helmet collimators at\n$(x,y,z=236 {\\rm mm})$, show strong correlations between $\\rho=(x^2+y^2)^{1/2}$\nand their polar angle $\\theta$, on one side, and between $\\tan^{-1}(y/x)$ and\ntheir azimuthal angle $\\phi$, on the other. This enables us to propose a\nsimplified model which treats the full source channel as a mathematical\ncollimator. This simplified model produces doses in excellent agreement with\nthose found for the full geometry. In the region of maximal dose, the relative\ndifferences between both calculations are within 3%, for the 18 and 14 mm\nhelmets, and 10%, for the 8 and 4 mm ones. Besides, the simplified model\npermits a strong reduction (larger than a factor 15) in the computational time.",

The potential hadronic attenuation has therefore to be\naddressed in further detail before definite conclusions on possible QCD effects\nin a deconfined QGP phase can be drawn with respect to the materializing jets.\n  From our transport studies we find that the interactions of fully formed\nhadrons are practically negligible in central Au+Au collisions at \\sqrt s = 200\nGeV for $p_\\perp\\geq 6 GeV$, but have some importance for the shape of the\nratio $R_{AA}$ at lower $p_\\perp$ ($\\leq 6 GeV$). However, a significant part\nof the large suppression seen experimentally is attributed to inelastic\ninteractions of 'leading' jet-like pre-hadrons with the dense hadronic\nenvironment. In addition, we also show within this scenario first (preliminary)\nresults of near-side and far-side correlations of high $p_\\perp$ particles from\ncentral Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV. It turns out that the\nnear-side correlations are unaltered -- in accordance with experiment --\nwhereas the far-side correlations are suppressed by $\\sim$ 60%. Since the\nexperimental observation is a nearly complete disappearance of the far-side jet\nthere should be some additional and earlier partonic interactions in the dense\nand possibly colored medium.",

    "summary": "In this paper, we focus on the role of power corrections in QCD\nfactorization(QCDF) method in charmless two-body nonleptonic $B$ meson decays.\nWe use the ratio of the branching fraction of $B^+ \\to \\pi^+ K^{\\ast 0}$ to\nthat of $B^0 \\to \\pi^- \\rho^+$, for which the theoretical uncertainties are\ngreatly reduced, to show clearly that the power corrections in charmless B\ndecays are probably large. With other similar ratios considered, for example,\nfor the $B^0 \\to K^- \\rho^+$ decay, it is very likely that, among various\nsources of power corrections, annihilation topology plays an indispensable role\nat least for penguin dominated $\\rm PV$ channels. We also consider some\nselective ratios of direct CP asymmetries. Among these, we find that, if power\ncorrections other than the chirally enhanced power corrections and annihilation\ntopology were negligible, QCDF would predict the direct CP asymmetry of $B \\to\n\\pi^+ \\pi^-$ to be about 3 times larger than that of $B \\to \\pi^\\pm K^\\mp$,\nwith opposite sign. Experimentally any significant deviation from this\nprediction would suggest either new physics or possibly the importance of\nlong-distance rescattering effects.",

Its\ndegree zero subcategory is braided and equivalent to the usual representation\ncategory Rep A. Combining this with [29], where Rep A was proven to be modular\nfor a nice class of rational conformal models, and with the construction of\ninvariants of G-manifolds in [60], we obtain an equivariant version of the\nfollowing chain of constructions: Rational CFT -> modular category ->\n3-manifold invariant.\n  We then study the relation between GLoc A and the braided (in the usual\nsense) representation category Rep A^G of the orbifold theory A^G. We prove the\nequivalence Rep A^G = (GLoc A)^G, which is a rigorous implementation of the\ninsight that one needs to take the twisted representations of A into account in\norder to determine Rep A^G. In the opposite direction we have GLoc A = Rep A^G\n\\rtimes S, where S \\subset Rep A^G is the full subcategory of representations\nof A^G contained in the vacuum representation of A, and \\rtimes refers to the\nGalois extensions of braided tensor categories of [44,48].\n  If A is completely rational and G is finite we prove that A has g-twisted\nrepresentations for every g in G. In the holomorphic case (where Rep A =\nVect_C) this allows to classify the possible categories GLoc A and to clarify\nthe role of the twisted quantum doubles D^\\omega(G) in this context, as will be\ndone in a sequel.

    "summary": "Using HST/WFPC2 imaging in F606W (or F450W) and F814W filters, we obtained\nthe color maps in observed frame for 36 distant (0.4<z<1.2) luminous infrared\ngalaxies (LIRGs), with average star formation rates of ~100 M_sun/yr. Stars and\ncompact sources are taken as references to align images after correction of\ngeometric distortion. This leads to an alignment accuracy of 0.15 pixel, which\nis a prerequisite for studying the detailed color properties of galaxies with\ncomplex morphologies. A new method is developed to quantify the reliability of\neach pixel in the color map without any bias against very red or blue color\nregions.Based on analyses of two-dimensional structure and spatially resolved\ncolor distribution, we carried out morphological classification for LIRGs.\nAbout 36% of the LIRGs were classified as disk galaxies and 22% as irregulars.\nOnly 6 (17%) systems are obvious ongoing major mergers. An upper limit of 58%\nwas found for the fraction of mergers in LIRGs with all the possible\nmerging/interacting systems included. Strikingly, the fraction of compact\nsources is as high as 25%, similar to that found in optically selected samples.\n  From their K band luminosities, LIRGs are relatively massive systems, with an\naverage stellar mass of about 1.1x10^11 solar mass. They are related to the\nformation of massive and large disks, from their morphologies and also from the\nfact that they represent a significant fraction of distant disks selected by\ntheir sizes. The compact LIRGs show blue cores, which could be associated with\nthe formation of the central region of these galaxies. We suggest that there\nare many massive disks still forming a large fraction of their stellar mass\nsince z=1. For most of them, their central parts (bulge?) were formed prior to\nthe formation of their disks.",

This work focuses on the low temperature physics of\nthe dipolar isotropic frustrated antiferromagnetic pyrochlore materials.\nCandidate magnetic ground states are numerically determined at zero temperature\nand the role of quantum spin fluctuations around these states are studied using\na Holstein-Primakoff spin wave expansion to order 1/S.

The inclusion of long range dipole interactions causes a\nrestoration of symmetry and a suppression of the observed anisotropy gap\nleading to an increase in quantum fluctuations in the ground state when\ncompared to a model with truncated dipole interactions.

Next, we focus on\nscalar-tensor theories of gravity, discussing the implications of a coupling\nbetween the Quintessence scalar field and the Ricci scalar (``Extended\nQuintessence'').

The time evolution features a rich hierarchy of scales which are\nwidely separated in the nearly degenerate or relativistic cases and originate\nin interference phenomena between particle and antiparticle states. In the\ndegenerate case the flavor asymmetry $\\Delta N(t)$ relaxes to the asymptotic\nlimit $\\Delta N(\\infty)=\\Delta N(0)\\cos^2(2\\theta)$ via dephasing resulting\nfrom the oscillations between flavor modes that are not Pauli blocked, with a\npower law $1/t$ for $t>t_s \\approx 2 k_F/\\Delta M^2$. $k_F$ is the largest of\nthe Fermi momenta. The distribution function for flavor neutrinos and\nantineutrinos as well as off-diagonal densities are obtained.

We present here new\nhigh resolution maps at mm wavelengths in different molecules (HCO+, C34S,\nH2CS, SO2 and CH3CN), as well as in the 1.2 and 3.3 mm continuum obtained with\nthe Plateau de Bure interferometer, and JCMT observations at 450 micron and 850\nmicron that unambiguously reveal the presence of new YSOs placed in between the\ntwo HII regions S235A and S235B and associated with the water maser. A\nmolecular core and an unresolved source in the mm and in the sub-mm are centred\non the maser, with indication of mass infall onto the core. Two molecular\nbipolar outflows and a jet originate from the same position. Weak evidence is\nfound for a molecular rotating disk perpendicular to the direction of the main\nbipolar outflow. The derived parameters indicate that one of the YSOs is an\nintermediate luminosity object (L~1000 Lsun) in a very early evolutionary\nphase, embedded in a molecular core of ~100 Msun, with a temperature of 30 K.\nThe main source of energy for the YSO could come from gravitational infall,\nthus making of this YSO a rare example of intermediate luminosity protostar\nrepresenting a link between the earliest evolutionary phases of massive stars\nand low mass protostars of class 0-I.",

    "summary": "Isolated HAEBE stars are believed to represent an intermediate stage of\nobjects between young stellar objects surrounded by massive, optically thick,\ngaseous and dusty disks and Vega like stars surrounded by debris disks. The\nstar AB Aur is already known for being surrounded by an intermediate-stage dust\ndisk emitting a fairly large infrared and (sub-)millimetric excess. Until now,\nthe outer disk structure has only been resolved at millimeter wavelengths and\nat optical wavelength coronographic imaging. We have obtained 20 microns images\nwhich show an unexpected ellipse-shaped disk structure in emission at a\ndistance of about 260 AU from the central star. Large azimuthal asymmetries in\nbrightness can be noticed and the center of the ellipse does not coincide with\nthe star. A simple, pure geometrical model based on an emission ring of uniform\nsurface brightness, but having an intrinsic eccentricity succeeds in fitting\nthe observations. These observations give for the first time clues on a very\npeculiar structure of pre-main-sequence disk geometry, i.e. a non uniform\nincrease in the disk thickness unlike the common usual sketch of a disk with a\nconstant flaring angle. They provide also valuable informations on the disk\ninclination as well as its dust composition; at such a large distance from the\nstar, only transient heating of very small particles can explain such a bright\nring of emission at mid-infrared wavelengths. Finally, the increase of\nthickness inferred by the model could be caused by disk instabilities; the\nintrinsic eccentricity of the structure might be a clue to the presence of a\nmassive body undetected yet.",

    "summary": "Noise properties of an idealized atomic magnetometer that utilizes spin\nsqueezing induced by a continuous quantum nondemolition measurement are\nconsidered. Such a magnetometer measures spin precession of $N$ atomic spins by\ndetecting optical rotation of far-detuned light. Fundamental noise sources\ninclude the quantum projection noise and the photon shot-noise. For measurement\ntimes much shorter than the spin-relaxation time observed in the absence of\nlight ($\\tau_{\\rm rel}$) divided by $\\sqrt{N}$, the optimal sensitivity of the\nmagnetometer scales as $N^{-3/4}$, so an advantage over the usual sensitivity\nscaling as $N^{-1/2}$ can be achieved. However, at longer measurement times,\nthe optimized sensitivity scales as $N^{-1/2}$, as for a usual shot-noise\nlimited magnetometer. If strongly squeezed probe light is used, the Heisenberg\nuncertainty limit may, in principle, be reached for very short measurement\ntimes. However, if the measurement time exceeds $\\tau_{\\rm rel}/N$, the\n$N^{-1/2}$ scaling is again restored.",

    "summary": "The central regions of many interacting and early-type spiral galaxies are\nactively forming stars. This process affects the physical and chemical\nproperties of the local interstellar medium as well as the evolution of the\ngalaxies. We observed near-infrared H2 emission lines: v=1-0 S(1), 3-2 S(3),\n1-0 S(0), and 2-1 S(1) from the central ~1 kpc regions of the archetypical\nstarburst galaxies, M82 and NGC 253, and the less dramatic but still vigorously\nstar-forming galaxies, NGC 6946 and IC 342. Like the far-infrared continuum\nluminosity, the near-infrared H2 emission luminosity can directly trace the\namount of star formation activity because the H2 emission lines arise from the\ninteraction between hot and young stars and nearby neutral clouds. The observed\nH2 line ratios show that both thermal and non-thermal excitation are\nresponsible for the emission lines, but that the great majority of the\nnear-infrared H2 line emission in these galaxies arises from energy states\nexcited by ultraviolet fluorescence. The derived physical conditions, e.g.,\nfar-ultraviolet radiation field and gas density, from [C II] and [O I] lines\nand far-infrared continuum observations when used as inputs to\nphotodissociation models, also explain the luminosity of the observed H2 v=1-0\nS(1) line. The ratio of the H2 v=1-0 S(1) line to far-IR continuum luminosity\nis remarkably constant over a broad range of galaxy luminosities; L_H2/L_FIR =\nabout 10^{-5}, in normal late-type galaxies (including the Galactic center), in\nnearby starburst galaxies, and in luminous IR galaxies (LIRGs: L_FIR > 10^{11}\nL_sun). Examining this constant ratio in the context of photodissociation\nregion models, we conclude that it implies that the strength of the incident UV\nfield on typical molecular clouds follows the gas density at the cloud surface.",

The calculation for\nderivatives of solute chemical potentials with respect to solute molar\nconcentrations was made using the method presented in \\cite{1}. This method is\napplicable to systems in which the molar concentration of one solute is very\nsmall compared to that of the other, like in our case. The approach is\nillustrated for the lysozyme chloride-Na$_2$SO$_4$-water system at 25$^o$ C, pH\n4.5 and at 0.6 mM (8.6 mg/mL) lysozyme chloride and 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.65, and\n0.8 M Na$_2$SO$_4$ concentrations. The calculated solute chemical potential\nderivatives were used to compute the protein cation charge approximately. We\nalso compute the diffusion Onsager coefficients $(L_{ij})_o$ for each\ncomposition at pH 4.5.",

This result is general, it\ncan be applied to all antenna systems and is valid for all schemes to detect\npolarization, like correlation and differential polarimeters. The axisymmetric\ncase is attractive: it generates an $E$-mode--like $\\Pi$ pattern, the\ncontamination does not depend on the scanning strategy and the instrumental\npolarization map does not have $B$-mode contamination, making axisymmetric\nsystems suitable to detect the faint $B$-mode signal of the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground Polarization. The $E$-mode of the contamination only affects the\nFWHM scales leaving the larger ones significantly cleaner. Our analysis is also\napplied to the SPOrt experiment where we find that the contamination of the\n$E$-mode is negligible in the $\\ell$-range of interest for CMBP large angular\nscale investigations (multipole $\\ell < 10$).",

Multiple fluorescent and H-and He-like emission\nlines in the band 1.6 - 20 Angstrom in eclipse are partially obscured at phase\n0.25 by the X-ray continuum. The phase 0.25 spectrum displays 3 triplets, 2\nwith a blue-shifted resonance (r) line in absorption and the intercombination\n(i) and forbidden (f) lines in emission, and shows in absorption other\nblue-shifted lines seen in emission in eclipse. At phase 0.5 the soft X-ray\ncontinuum diminishes revealing an \"eclipse-like\" spectrum, however line flux\nvalues are around 13-fold those in eclipse. We conclude the narrow emission\nlines in Vela X-1 become apparent when the continuum is blocked from line of\nsight, either by eclipse or by scattering and/or absorption from a wake or\ncloud. The H-and He-like lines arise in warm photoionised regions in the\nstellar wind, while the fluorescent lines (including a Ni K alpha line) are\nproduced in cooler clumps of gas outside these regions. Absorption of the 5-13\nAngstrom continuum at phase 0.5 may be caused by an accretion wake comprised of\ndense stagnant photoionized plasma inside a Stromgren zone.

New far-ultraviolet spectra are shown for four bright H II regions in\nM33 (NGC 588, 592, 595, and 604), the H II region NGC 5461 in M101, and the\nstarburst nucleus of NGC 7714, supplemented by the very-low-metallicity galaxy\nI Zw 18. In each case, we see strong Milky Way absorption systems from H2, but\nintrinsic absorption within each galaxy is weak or undetectable, perhaps\nbecause of the \"UV bias\" in which reddened stars which lie behind\nmolecular-rich areas are also heavily reddened. We see striking changes in the\nstellar-wind lines from these populations with metallicity, suggesting that C\nII, C III, C IV, N II, N III, and P V lines are potential tracers of stellar\nmetallicity in star-forming galaxies. Three of these relations - involving N\nIV, C III, and P V - are nearly linear over the range from O/H=0.05--0.8 solar.\nThe major difference in continuum shapes among these systems is that the giant\nH II complex NGC 604 has a stronger continuum shortward of 950 A than any other\nobject in this sample. Small-number statistics would likely go in the other\ndirection; we favor this as the result of a discrete star-forming event ~3 Myr\nago, as suggested by previous studies of its stellar population.

If the reduced\nphase space exists, a star-product with suitable Deligne class is representable\nand the reduced algebra is the commutant of this module (hence a bimodule).\nObstructions to representability to third order are related to the\nAtiyah-Molino class of the foliation of the coisotropic submanifold, and the\nsame kind of obstructions occurs for the quantisation of a Poisson map between\nsymplectic manifolds.

    "summary": "Powerful Type I X-ray burst with strong radial expansion was observed from\nthe low mass X-ray binary 4U 1820-30 with Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer on May 2,\n  1997. We investigate closely the flux profile during the burst expansion\nstage. Applying a semi-analytical model we are able to uncover the behavior of\na photospheric radius and to simulate the evolution of neutron star\n(NS)-accretion disk system. The bottom flux L_{bot} is a few times the\nEddington limit L_{Edd} for outer layers, because the electron cross-section is\na few times less than the Thomson cross-section at such a high temperatures.\nThe surplus of energy flux with respect to the Eddington, $L_{bot}-L_{Edd}$,\ngoes into the potential energy of the expanded envelope. As cooling of the\nburning zone starts the surplus decreases and thus the envelope shrinks while\nthe emergent photon flux stays the same $L=L_{Edd}$. At a certain moment the NS\nlow-hemisphere, previously screened by the disk, becomes visible to the\nobserver. Consequently, the flux detected by the observer increases. Indeed, we\nobserve to the paradoxical situation when the burning zone cools, but the\napparent flux increases because of the NS-accretion disk geometry. We\ndemonstrate a strong observational evidence of NS-accretion disk occultation in\nthe behavior of the observed bolometric flux. We estimate the anisotropy due to\ngeometry and find that the system should have a high inclination angle.\nFinally, we apply an analytical model of X-ray spectral formation in the\nneutron star atmosphere during burst decay stage to infer the neutron star (NS)\nmass-radius relation.",

The coronal abundances\nare generally ~0.5 times the solar photospheric values that are presumed fairly\nrepresentative of the composition of the underlying star.

A\nnon-standard approach to the calculation of Tb is developed that can be\nextended to MOND whenever discreteness noise generates force fluctuations that\nare small compared to the mean-field force. It is shown that this approach\nyields standard Newtonian results for systems in which the mean density profile\nis either plane-parallel or spherical.

In this work, a collective coordinate approach\nallows us to identify the mechanism through which the width oscillation drives\nthe kink and its relation with the mathematical symmetry conditions.\nFurthermore, our theory predicts, and numerical simulations confirm, that the\ndirection of motion depends on the initial phase of the driving, while the\nsystem behaves in a ratchet-like fashion if averaging over initial conditions.\nFinally, the presence of noise overimposed to the ac driving does not destroy\nthe directed motion; on the contrary, it gives rise to an activation process\nthat increases the velocity of the motion.

The questions of why the universe started out\nundergoing high energy inflation, and why it will end up in low energy\ninflation, are unanswered. Rather than resort to anthropic arguments, we have\ndeveloped an alternative cosmology, the Cyclic universe, in which the universe\nexists in a very long-lived attractor state determined by the laws of physics.\nThe model shares inflation's phenomenological successes without requiring an\nepoch of high energy inflation. Instead, the universe is made homogeneous and\nflat, and scale-invariant adiabatic perturbations are generated during an epoch\nof low energy acceleration like that seen today, but preceding the last big\nbang. Unlike inflation, the model requires low energy acceleration in order for\na periodic attractor state to exist.

As a result, the granular contact\nforce probability density functions are obtained from first principles for this\ncase. The results are in excellent agreement with the experimental and\nsimulation data. The derivation assumes Edwards' flat measure -- a density of\nstates that is uniform within the metastable regions of phase space. The\nenabling assumption, supported by physical arguments and empirical evidence, is\nthat correlating information is not significantly recursive through loops in\nthe packing. Maximizing a state-counting entropy results in a transport\nequation that can be solved numerically. For the present this has been done\nusing the \"mean structure approximation,\" projecting the density of states\nacross all angular coordinates to more clearly identify its predominant\nnon-uniformities. These features are: (1) the grain factor (Psi) related to\ngrain stability and strong correlation between the contact forces on the same\ngrain, and (2) the structure factor (Upsilon) related to Newton's third law and\nstrong correlation between neighboring grains.",

We have developed a Monte Carlo simulation for\nultra-peripheral $e^+e^-$ production at RHIC based on the Equivalent Photon\nApproximation, the lowest-order QED $e^+e^-$ production cross-section by two\nreal photons and the assumption that the mutual nuclear excitations and the \\ee\nproduction are independent (EPA model). %We present cross-section predictions\nfrom this model in various kinematic regions.\n  We compare our experimental results to two models: the EPA model and a model\nbased on full QED calculation of the \\ee production, taking the photon\nvirtuality into account.

The present approach is based on the\nrecognition that, like determinism, objective reality is an unrealistic\nobjective.

(iii)\nIts core mass function is strongly peaked at a few $M_\\odot$, and the cores\nhave extended envelopes and relatively low levels of turbulence.\n  We present here the results of an ensemble of hydrodynamic simulations which\nsuggest that the unusual stellar IMF in Taurus is a direct consequence of the\nunusual properties of the cores there. By following the collapse and\nfragmentation of cores having properties typical of Taurus, we find that\nroughly 50% of the objects formed in a core, predominantly the low-mass ones,\nare ejected from the core to form a population of low-mass stars and brown\ndwarfs with a flat mass function. The remaining objects form multiple systems\nwithin the core, accreting until their masses approach $1 M_\\odot$; this\nproduces a population of intermediate-mass stars whose mass function peaks at\n$\\sim 0.8 M_\\odot$. Together these two populations reproduce the IMF in Taurus\nvery well. This demonstrates, for the first time, a direct causal link between\nthe core mass function and the stellar IMF in a star formation region.",

At later times,\nthe accretion disk becomes thick and the jet fades resulting in a wind that is\nejected from the surface of the thickened (torus-like) disk. It should be noted\nthat no streaming matter from a donor is included at the outer boundary in the\nsimulation (an isolated black hole not binary black hole). The wind flows\noutwards with a wider angle than the initial jet. The widening of the jet is\nconsistent with the outward moving torsional Alfv\\'{e}n waves (TAWs).

We first study the\ndeformation $F_t(z)=z-tH(z)$ of $F(z)$ and its formal inverse\n$G_t(z)=z+tN_t(z)$. (Note that $G_{t=1}(z)=G(z)$ when $o(H(z))\\geq 2$.) We show\nthat $N_t(z)$ is the unique power series solution of a Cauchy problem of a PDE,\nfrom which we derive a recurrent formula for $G_t(z)$. Secondly, motivated by\nthe gradient reduction obtained by M. de Bondt, A. van den Essen \\cite{BE1} and\nG.

The recurrent inversion formula and the binary\nrooted tree expansion inversion formula derived in this paper can also be used\nas computational algorithms for solutions of certain Cauchy problems of the\ninviscid Burgers' equations and Legendre transforms of the power series $f(z)$\nof $o(f(z))\\geq 2$.",

The stabilization occurs at the one-loop level, through the\nfermionic contribution to the effective potential; in the Higgs case, for\nstabilization to take place the bosonic contribution must be balanced by the\nfermionic one, hence the scales of these two cannot differ too much. However,\nthere is no need for (softly broken) supersymmetry to achieve the stabilization\n- it can be arranged for a reasonably wide range of couplings and mass scales.\nThe primary instability in the model is the run-away of the radion vacuum\nexpectation value. It turns out that the requirement of the radion stability,\nin the Higgs case, favours a Higgs boson mass below 0.26 TeV, which is\nconsistent with the Standard Model upper bound that follows from the\nelectroweak precision measurements. The typical radion mass is of the order of\n10^{-6} eV. The radion mass can be made larger by rising the scale of fermion\nmasses, as clearly seen in the Higgsless case. The cosmological constant may be\ncancelled by suitable counterterms, in such a way that the stabilization is not\naffected.",

The large condensate fractions are interpreted in terms of\npre-existing molecules which are quasi-stable even above the two-body Feshbach\nresonance due to the presence of the degenerate Fermi gas.",

Our results indicate that the CEF level\nsplitting in all three materials is similar, and can be thought of as being\nderived from the cubic parent compound CeIn3 in which an excited state quartet\nat ~12 meV is split into two doublets by the lower symmetry of the tetragonal\nenvironment of the CeMIn5 materials. In each case, the CEF excitations are\nobserved as broad lines in the inelastic neutron scattering spectrum. We\nattribute this broadening to Kondo hybridization of the localized f moments\nwith the conduction electrons. The evolution of the superconducting transition\ntemperatures in the different members of CeMIn5 can then be understood as a\ndirect consequence of the strength of this hybridization.

In this form, the CFJ model appears as a special case of the pre-metric\napproach recently developed by Hehl and Obukhov. This embedding turns out to be\nnon-trivial. Particularly, the pre-metric energy-momentum tensor does not\ndepend on the axion. This is in contrast to the CFJ energy-momentum tensor\nwhich involves the axion addition explicitly. We show that the relation between\nthese two quantities is similar to the correspondence between the Noether\nconserved tensor and the Hilbert symmetric tensor. As a result the CFJ\nenergy-momentum tensor appears as the unique conserved closure of the\npre-metric one. Another problem is in the description of the birefringence\neffect, which in the pre-metric framework does not depend on the axion. The\ncomparison with the CFJ model shows that the corresponding wave propagation\n(Fresnel) equation has to be extended by a derivative term, which is non zero\nfor the axion field. In this way, the CFJ birefringence effect is derived in\nthe metric-free approach. Consequently the Lorentz and CPT violating models can\nbe embedded without contradictions in the pre-metric approach to\nelectrodynamics. This correspondence can be useful for both constructions.",

    "summary": "We reconsider the low-energy effective theory for Higgs-less electroweak\nsymmetry breaking: we study the anomaly-matching in the situation where all\nGoldstone fields disappear from the spectrum as a result of the Higgs\nmechanism. We find that the global SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R x U(1)_{B-L} symmetry of\nthe underlying theory, which is spontaneously broken to SU(2)_{L+R} x\nU(1)_{B-L} has to be anomaly-free. For the sake of generality, we include the\npossibility of light spin-1/2 bound states resulting from the dynamics of the\nstrongly-interacting symmetry-breaking sector, in addition to the Goldstone\nbosons. Such composite fermions may have non-standard couplings at the leading\norder, and an arbitrary total B-L charge. In order to perform the\nanomaly-matching in that case, we generalize the construction of the\nWess-Zumino effective lagrangian. Composite fermions beyond the three known\ngenerations are theoretically allowed, and there are no restrictions from the\nanomaly-matching on their couplings nor on their U(1)_{B-L} charge. Absence of\nglobal anomalies for the composite sector as a whole does not preclude\nanomalous triple gauge boson couplings arising from composite fermion\ntriangular diagrams. On the other hand, the trace of B-L over elementary\nfermions must vanish if all Goldstone modes are to disappear from the spectrum.",

The resulting\nforces trap the moduli at these points, which often exhibit enhanced symmetry.\nModuli trapping occurs in time-dependent quantum field theory, as well as in\nsystems of moving D-branes, where it leads the branes to combine into stacks.\nTrapping also occurs in an expanding universe, though the range over which the\nmoduli can roll is limited by Hubble friction. We observe that a scalar field\ntrapped on a steep potential can induce a stage of acceleration of the\nuniverse, which we call trapped inflation. Moduli trapping ameliorates the\ncosmological moduli problem and may affect vacuum selection. In particular,\nrolling moduli are most powerfully attracted to the points with the largest\nnumber of light particles, which are often the points of greatest symmetry.\nGiven suitable assumptions about the dynamics of the very early universe, this\neffect might help to explain why among the plethora of possible vacuum states\nof string theory, we appear to live in one with a large number of light\nparticles and (spontaneously broken) symmetries.

We derive K-band mass-to-light ratios by fitting a grid\nof composite stellar population models of varying star formation history, age,\nand dust extinction to BVRIJK photometry. We discuss the evolution of the\naverage mass-to-light ratio as a function of galaxy stellar mass in the K-band\nand in the B-band. We compare our stellar mass function at z > 0 to estimates\nobtained similarly at z=0. We find that the mass-to-light ratios in the K-band\ndecline with redshift. This decline is similar for all stellar masses above\n$10^10 Msun. Lower mass galaxies have lower mass-to-light ratios at all\nredshifts. The stellar mass function evolves significantly to z = 1.2. The\ntotal normalization decreases by a factor of ~2, the characteristic mass (the\nknee) shifts towards lower masses and the bright end therefore steepens with\nredshift. The amount of number density evolution is a strong function of\nstellar mass, with more massive systems showing faster evolution than less\nmassive systems. We discuss the total stellar mass density of the universe and\ncompare our results to the values from the literature both at lower and higher\nredshift. We find that the stellar mass density at z~1 is roughly 50% of the\nlocal value. Our results imply that the mass assembly of galaxies continues\nwell after $z \\sim 1$.

Secondly, we show how\nequivalent results can be obtained easily by taking the continuum limit of the\nproblem and then using a disordered version of the well-known Cole--Hopf\nmapping to linearize the equation.

This galaxy is by far the closest galaxy to this absorber, projected\njust 71 kpc on the sky from the sightline. The mean properties of the stellar\npopulations in this galaxy are consistent with a massive starburst ~3.5 Gyrs\nago, whose attendant supernovae, we argue, could have driven sufficient gas\nfrom this galaxy to explain the nearby absorber. Beyond the proximity on the\nsky and in recession velocity, the further evidence in favor of this conclusion\nincludes both a match in the metallicities of absorber and galaxy, and the fact\nthat the absorber has an overabundance of Si/C, suggesting recent type II\nsupernova enrichment.

In a recent paper\nMosquera Cuesta & Salim (2003) presented the first astrophysical study where\nsuch nonlinear electrodynamics (NLEDs) effects were accounted for in the case\nof a highly magnetized neutron star or pulsar. In that paper the NLEDs was\ninvoked {\\it a l\\`a} Euler-Heisenberg, which is an infinite series expansion of\nwhich only the first term was used for the analisys. The immediate consequence\nof that study was an overall modification of the space-time geometry around the\npulsar, which is ``perceived'', in principle, only by light propagating out of\nthe star. This translates into an significant change in the surface redshift,\nas inferred from absorption (emission) lines observed from a super magnetized\npulsar. The result proves to be even more dramatic for the so-called magnetars,\npulsars endowed with magnetic ($B$) fields higher then the Schafroth quantum\nelectrodynamics critical $B$-field. Here we demonstrate that the same effect\nstill appears if one calls for the NLEDs in the form of the one rigorously\nderived by Born & Infeld (1934) based on the special relativistic limit for the\nvelocity of approaching of an elementary particle to a pointlike electron [From\nthe mathematical point of view, the Born & Infeld (1934) NLEDs is described by\nan exact Lagrangean, whose dynamics has been successfully studied in a wide set\nof physical systems.].",

The balancing of its two non-perturbative effects, open membrane\ninstantons against gaugino condensation on the hidden boundary, which act with\nopposing forces on the interval length, is used to stabilize the orbifold\nmodulus (dilaton) and other moduli. The non-perturbative effects break\nsupersymmetry spontaneously through F-terms which leads to a positive vacuum\nenergy density. In contrast to the situation for the weakly coupled heterotic\nstring, the charged scalar matter fields receive non-vanishing vacuum\nexpectation values and therefore masses in a phenomenologically relevant\nregime. It is important that in order to obtain these de Sitter vacua we are\nnot relying on exotic effects or fine-tuning of parameters. Vacua with more\nrealistic supersymmetry breaking scales and gravitino masses are obtained by\nbreaking the hidden $E_8$ gauge group down to groups of smaller rank. Also\nsmall values for the open membrane instanton Pfaffian are favored in this\nrespect.

    "summary": "This paper present a geometric diagram of a separable state: If a mixed state\n$\\sigma $ is separable, there are $2^{nS(\\sigma)}$ linearly independant product\nvectors which span the same Hilbert space as the $2^{nS(\\sigma)}$ ``likely''\nstrings of $\\sigma ^{\\otimes n}$ do. This diagram results in a criterion for\nseparability which is strictly stronger than the inorder criterion in [M.A.\nNielsen and J. Kempe, Phys. Rev. Lett. 86, 5184 (2001)]. This means that the\nnumber of product bases of states of a system has close link to the nonlocality\nof the system.",

First, we extend our previous analysis to 1000 US\nstocks and perform a new estimation of market impact that accounts for\nsplitting of large orders and potential autocorrelations in the trade flow. Our\nnew analysis shows clearly that price impact and volume are related by a\nsquare-root functional form of market impact for large volumes, in contrast to\nthe claim of FL that this relationship increases as a power law with a smaller\nexponent. Since large orders are usually executed by splitting into smaller\nsize trades, procedures used by FL give a downward bias for this power law\nexponent. Second, FL analyze 3 stocks traded on the London Stock Exchange, and\nsolely on this basis they claim that the distribution of transaction volumes do\nnot have a power-law tail for the London Stock Exchange. We perform new\nempirical analysis on transaction data for the 262 largest stocks listed in the\nLondon Stock Exchange, and find that the distribution of volume decays as a\npower-law with an exponent $\\approx 3/2$ -- in sharp contrast to FL's claim\nthat the distribution of transaction volume does not have a power-law tail. Our\nexponent estimate of $\\approx 3/2$ is consistent with our previous results from\nthe New York and Paris Stock Exchanges. We conclude that the available\nempirical evidence is consistent with our hypothesis on the origin of power-law\nfluctuations in stock prices.",

The electron correlation in PuCoGa5\nis estimated to be weak compared with CeMIn5, and the filling number of\nelectrons is considered to be far from 0.5/spin in the band which plays an\nimportant role in realizing the superconductivity. Nevertheless, the\nsuperconducting transition temperature Tc in PuCoGa5 is almost by an order of\nmagnitude higher than that in CeMIn5. In order to explain the superconductivity\nwith high Tc, we adopt the periodic Anderson model and calculate Tc by solving\nthe Dyson-Gor'kov equation derived by the third order perturbation theory with\nrespect to U. By this calculation, we indicate that the superconducting state\nof PuCoGa5 is a d-wave pairing state, and show that the good location of two\nFermi surfaces results in the high Tc in PuCoGa5.",

As one of models\nin which distributions follow power law in the large scale region and deviate\nfurther from the power law in the smaller scale region, we employ 2-dim quantum\ngravity modified by the $R^2$ term. As examples of distributions in the real\nworld which have similar property to this model, we consider those of personal\nincome in Japan over latest twenty fiscal years. We find relations between the\ntypical scale and several kinds of averages in this model, and observe that\nthese relations are also valid in recent personal income distributions in Japan\nwith sufficient accuracy. We show the existence of the fiscal years so called\nbubble term in which the gap has arisen in power law, by observing that the\ndata are away from one of these relations. We confirm, therefore, that the\ndistribution of this model has close similarity to those of personal income. In\naddition, we can estimate the value of Pareto index and whether a big gap\nexists in power law by using only these relations. As a result, we point out\nthat the typical scale is an useful concept different from average value and\nthat the distribution function derived in this model is an effective tool to\ninvestigate these kinds of distributions.",

The use of a line-by-line differential analysis technique\nbetween the components of each pair allows to reach errors of about 0.02 dex in\nthe iron content difference. Most of the pairs have abundance differences lower\nthan 0.02 dex and there are no pairs with differences larger than 0.07 dex. The\nfour cases of differences larger than 0.02 dex may be spouriuos because of the\nlarger error bars affecting pairs with large temperature difference, cold stars\nand rotating stars. The pair HD 219542, previously reported by us to have\ndifferent composition, results instead normal. For non-rotating stars warmer\nthan 5500 K, we are able to exclude in most cases the ingestion of more than 1\nEarth Mass of iron (about 5 Earth masses of meteoritic material) during the\nmain sequence lifetime of the stars, placing more stringent limits (about 0.4\nEarth masses of iron) in five cases of warm stars. This latter limit is similar\nto the estimates of rocky material accreted by the Sun during its main sequence\nlifetime. Combining the results of the present analysis with those for the\nHyades and Pleiades, we conclude that the hypothesis that pollution by\nplanetary material is the only responsible for the highest metallicity of the\nstars with planets may be rejected at more than 99% level of confidence if the\nincidence of planets in these samples is as high as 8% and similar to the field\nstars included in current radial velocity surveys. However, the significance of\nthis result drops considerably if the incidence of planets around stars in\nbinary systems and clusters is less than a half than around normal field stars.",

By applying a relatively small uniaxial pressure,\ngreater than 0.1 GPa normal to the RuO2 layer, ferromagnetic ordering manifests\nbelow 80 K from the enhanced-paramagnet. Magnetization at 1 kOe and 2 K becomes\n100 times larger than that under ambient condition. Uniaxial pressure\ndependence of Curie temperature T_C suggests the first order magnetic\ntransition.

We report discovery\nof hyperfine structure in the H^{13}CO^{+}(1-0) transition. The doublet\nsplitting is observed to be 38.5 +/- 5.2 kHz, and is confirmed by calculations\nwhich give 39.8 kHz and a line strength ratio of 3:1. We improve the\nspectroscopic constants of H^{13}CO^{+} and determine the frequencies of its\nlow-J spectrum to better precision by analysing the dark cloud L1512.\nPotentially high optical depths (3 to 5 in L1512) in quiescent clouds require\nto consider the line's doublet nature when comparing to other molecular\nspecies, possibly reversing previous conclusions from single-component\ninterpretations. We further confirm the hyperfine splitting in the ^{13}CO(1-0)\ntransition that had been predicted, and measured in the laboratory, to be about\n46 kHz. By applying hyperfine analysis to the data set of the first IRAM\nkey-project we show that ^{13}CO optical depths can be estimated in narrow\nlinewidth regions without recourse to other transitions nor to assumptions on\nbeam filling factors, and linewidth and velocity determinations can be\nimproved. For the core of L1512 we find an inverse proportionality between\nlinewidth and column density resp. square root of optical depth, and a\nsystematic inside-out increase of excitation temperature and of the\n^{13}CO:C^{18}O abundance ratio. Overall motion toward the innermost region is\nsuggested.",

We find and characterize a transition between ordered\nand disordered states, mediated by a regime of dynamical clustering.",

We develop a new systematic procedure for this limit in\nperturbative QCD to arbitrary logarithmic order. The formalism relies on the IR\nstructure and the gauge symmetry of the theory. Using a factorization procedure\nintroduced by Sen, we derive a sum of convolutions in transverse momentum space\nover soft and jet functions, which approximate the amplitude up to\npower-suppressed corrections. A set of evolution equations generalizing the\nBFKL equation and controlling the high energy behavior of the amplitudes to\narbitrary logarithmic accuracy is derived. The general method is illustrated in\nthe case of leading and next-to-leading logarithmic gluon reggeization and BFKL\nequation. We confirm the standard results at LL accuracy. At NLL order, we find\nan agreement with the reggeization conjecture up to two loops. However,\nstarting at three loop order, we identify contributions violating the Regge\nansatz. In addition, we calculate the evolution kernel determining the\nhigh-energy behavior of the non-reggeized term in the scattering amplitude. In\nthe second part, we focus our attention to another intriguing problem of\nhigh-energy QCD, the resummation associated with soft radiation in dijet events\nwhich is complicated by the presence of non-global logarithms. We introduce a\nset of correlations between energy flow and event shapes that are sensitive to\nthe flow of color at short distances in jet events. The method is illustrated\nfor electron-positron dijet events. We calculate the correlation at leading\nlogarithm in the energy flow and at next-to-leading-logarithm in the event\nshape.",

For us $\\fc$ is\nusually a ``general'' complete intersection and we usually require that $A$ be\nlevel. The precise value of the Hilbert function of a relatively compressed\nalgebra is open, and we show that finding this value is equivalent to the\nFr\\\"oberg Conjecture. We then turn to the minimal free resolution of a level\nalgebra relatively compressed with respect to a general complete intersection.\nWhen the algebra is Gorenstein of even socle degree we give the precise\nresolution. When it is of odd socle degree we give good bounds on the graded\nBetti numbers. We also relate this case to the Minimal Resolution Conjecture of\nMustata for points on a projective variety. Finding the graded Betti numbers is\nessentially equivalent to determining to what extent there can be redundant\nsummands (i.e. ``ghost terms'') in the minimal free resolution, i.e. when\ncopies of the same $R(-t)$ can occur in two consecutive free modules. This is\neasy to arrange using Koszul syzygies; we show that it can also occur in more\nsurprising situations that are not Koszul. Using the equivalence to the\nFr\\\"oberg Conjecture, we show that in a polynomial ring where that conjecture\nholds (e.g. in three variables), the possible non-Koszul ghost terms are\nextremely limited. Finally, we use the connection to the Fr\\\"oberg Conjecture,\nas well as the calculation of the minimal free resolution for relatively\ncompressed Gorenstein algebras, to find the minimal free resolution of general\nArtinian almost complete intersections in many new cases. This greatly extends\nprevious work of the first two authors.",

We demonstrate that statistically significant overdensities and\nunderdensities do exist and hence represent the detection of cosmological\nfluctuations on comoving scales that correspond to those presently detected in\nthe cosmic microwave background. However, the fractional overdensities on\nscales >100Mpc are in the linear or only weakly non-linear regime and do not\nrepresent collapsed non-linear structures. We compare the measurements with the\nexpectation of a standard LCDM model by measuring the variance of counts in\ncells and find that, provided the distribution of QSOs on large scales exhibits\na mild bias with respect to the distribution of dark matter, the observed\nfluctuations are found to be in good agreement with the model. There is no\nevidence on such scales for any extreme structures that might require, for\nexample, departures from the assumption of Gaussian initial perturbations. Thus\nthe power-spectrum derived from the 2QZ Survey appears to provide a complete\ndescription of the distribution of QSOs. The amount of bias and its redshift\ndependence that is required is consistent with that found from studying the\nclustering of 2QZ QSOs on 10 Mpc scales, and may be adequately described by an\napproximately redshift-invariant power spectrum with normalisation sigma_8=1.0\ncorresponding to a bias at z=0 of b=1.1 rising to b=2 at the survey's mean\nredshift z=1.5.",

As a concrete\nexample, we consider the Dirac Hamiltonian of a massive fermionic quasiparticle\nand add a particular term with purely-spacelike CPT-violating parameters\nb_\\mu=(0,{\\bf b}). A quantum phase transition separates two phases, one with a\nfully-gapped fermion spectrum and the other with topologically-protected Fermi\npoints (gap nodes). The emergent Chern-Simons ``vector'' k_\\mu=(0,{\\bf k}) now\nconsists of two parts. The regular part, {\\bf k}^{reg}, is an analytic function\nof |{\\bf b}| across the quantum phase transition and may be nonzero due to\nexplicit CPT violation at the fundamental level. The anomalous (nonanalytic)\npart, {\\bf k}^{anom}, comes solely from the Fermi points and is proportional to\ntheir splitting. In the context of condensed-matter physics, the quantum phase\ntransition may occur in the region of the BEC-BCS crossover for Cooper pairing\nin the p-wave channel. For elementary particle physics, the splitting of Fermi\npoints may lead to neutrino oscillations, even if the total electromagnetic\nChern-Simons-like term cancels out.",

Taken with the DEIMOS multi-object spectrograph\non the Keck2 telescope, these data display a narrow velocity dispersion of\n11+/-3 km/s, with a steady radial velocity gradient of 245 km/s over the 125\nkpc radial extent of the stream studied so far. This implies that the Andromeda\ngalaxy possesses a substantial dark matter halo. We fit the orbit of the stream\nin different galaxy potential models. In a simple model with a composite bulge,\ndisk and halo, where the halo follows a ``universal'' profile that is\ncompressed by the formation of the baryonic components, we find that the\nkinematics of the stream require a total mass inside 125 kpc of\n7.5^(+2.5)_(-1.3) x 10^{11} M_Sun, or more than 5.4 x 10^{11} M_Sun at the 99%\nconfidence level. This is the first galaxy in which it has been possible to\nmeasure the halo mass distribution by such direct dynamical means over such a\nlarge distance range. The resulting orbit shows that if M32 or NGC 205 are\nconnected with the stream, they must either trail or lag the densest region of\nthe stream by more than 100 kpc. Furthermore, according to the best-fit orbit,\nthe stream passes very close to M31, causing its demise as a coherent structure\nand producing a fan of stars that will pollute the inner halo, thereby\nconfusing efforts to measure the properties of genuine halo populations. Our\ndata show that several recently identified planetary nebulae, which have been\nproposed as evidence for the existence of a new companion of M31, are likely\nmembers of the Andromeda Stream.",

The precession of an\ninclined accretion disk, as indirectly confirmed by the absence of low-state\npulsations, may be responsible for the observed variability. The spectrum of\nthe source is well described by a power-law energy dependence of the photon\nflux density with a slope of $\\sim1.5$ and an exponential cutoff at energies\nabove $\\sim14-18$ keV.

It is argued that quenched lattice data\nindicate the existence of net attraction in the colour-octet projection of the\nquark-antiquark scattering kernel. This attraction affects the uniformity with\nwhich solutions of truncated equations converge pointwise to solutions of the\ncomplete gap and vertex equations. For current-quark masses less than the scale\nset by dynamical chiral symmetry breaking, the dependence of the\ndressed-quark-gluon vertex on the current-quark mass is weak. The study employs\na vertex model whose diagrammatic content is explicitly enumerable. That\nenables the systematic construction of a vertex-consistent Bethe-Salpeter\nkernel and thereby an exploration of the consequences for the strong\ninteraction spectrum of attraction in the colour-octet channel. With rising\ncurrent-quark mass the rainbow-ladder truncation is shown to provide an\nincreasingly accurate estimate of a bound state's mass. Moreover, the\ncalculated splitting between vector and pseudoscalar meson masses vanishes as\nthe current-quark mass increases, which argues for the mass of the pseudoscalar\npartner of the \\Upsilon(1S) to be above 9.4 GeV. The absence of\ncolour-antitriplet diquarks from the strong interaction spectrum is contingent\nupon the net amount of attraction in the octet projected quark-antiquark\nscattering kernel. There is a window within which diquarks appear. The amount\nof attraction suggested by lattice results is outside this domain.",

The\n150 d period which has been seen before and shortly after the 1996 soft state\nis not obviously present in the ASM rate during most of this time. Applying\nselection criteria from our pointed RXTE/PCA observations to exclude the\nflaring episodes we show that the 150 d period can indeed still be\nsignificantly detected in the hard state. Furthermore, while the ~420 d\ntimescale associated with the flaring is reduced in the selected hard state\ncount rate, it is still pronounced in the temporal evolution of the\ncorresponding hardness ratios. The Ryle radio flux is also consistent with the\n150 d period being present but distorted during this time.",

The light speed, while being constant if defined with respect to\n$\\tau$ ({\\it i. e.} as ${\\rm d}\\ell /{\\rm d} \\tau$), would suffer an adiabatic\nsecular acceleration, $a_\\ell={\\rm d}c/{\\rm d}t >0$, if defined in terms of $t$\n({\\it i. e.} as ${\\rm d}\\ell /{\\rm d} t$). Such an adiabatic acceleration of\nlight, and a small acceleration of the Pioneer towards the Sun $a_{\\rm P}$\ncould be mistaken the one for the other, because they do have the same\nfingerprint: a blue shift.

The\nfirst expression, valid for an arbitrary pure state of n qubits, demonstrates\nthat the degree to which single particle properties are possessed by an\nindividual member of the system is limited by the bipartite entanglement that\nexists between that qubit and the remainder of the system. This result implies\nthat the phenomenon of entanglement sharing is one specific consequence of\ncomplementarity. The second expression, which holds for an arbitrary state of\ntwo qubits, pure or mixed, quantifies a tradeoff between the amounts of\nentanglement, separable uncertainty, and single particle properties that are\nencoded in the quantum state. The separable uncertainty is a natural measure of\nour ignorance about the properties possessed by individual subsystems, and may\nbe used to completely characterize the relationship between entanglement and\nmixedness in two-qubit systems. The two-qubit complementarity relation yields a\nuseful geometric picture in which the root mean square values of local\nsubsystem properties act like coordinates in the space of density matrices, and\nsuggests possible insights into the problem of interpreting quantum mechanics.",

Analytical\nasymptotic scaling behaviors of the intensity correlation in the double time t\nand t' domain are obtained. In the scaling limit <I(t)I(t+t')> --> h(x), where\nfour classes of behaviors are found: (i) finite averaged on and off times x=t'\n(standard behavior) (ii) on and off times with identical power law behaviors\nx=t/t' (case relevant for capped nano-crystals). (iii) exponential on times and\npower law off times x=tt' (case relevant for uncapped nano-crystals). (iv) For\ndefected off time distribution we also find x=t+t' . Origin of aging behavior\nis explained based on simple diffusion model. We argue that the diffusion\ncontrolled reaction A+B <--> AB, when followed on a single particle level\nexhibits aging behavior.",

The presence of such energy not only explains the observed accelerating\nexpansion of the Universe but also provides the remaining piece of information\nconnecting the inflationary flatness prediction with astronomical observations.\nHowever, despite of its good observational indications, the nature of the dark\nenergy still remains an open question. In this paper we explore a geometrical\nexplanation for such a component within the context of brane-world theory\nwithout mirror symmetry, leading to a geometrical interpretation for dark\nenergy as warp in the universe given by the extrinsic curvature. In particular,\nwe study the phenomenological implications of the extrinsic curvature of a\nFriedman-Robertson-Walker universe in a five-dimensional constant curvature\nbulk, with signatures (4,1) or (3,2), as compared with the X-matter (XCDM)\nmodel. From the analysis of the geometrically modified Friedman's equations,\nthe deceleration parameter and the Weak Energy Condition, we find a consistent\nagreement with the presently known observational data on inflation for the\ndeSitter bulk, but not for the anti-deSitter case.",

Here we\npresent exact evaluations of the likelihood of the low multipoles by direct\ninversion of the theoretical covariance matrix for low resolution WMAP maps. We\nproject out the unwanted galactic contaminants rather than subtract them, which\ncan remove some of the cosmological signal and may lead to a suppression of\npower. We find an increase in power at low multipoles. For the quadrupole the\nmaximum likelihood values are rather uncertain and vary between 140-220\\muK^2.\nOn the other hand, the probability distribution away from the peak is robust\nand, assuming a uniform prior between 0 an 2000\\muK^2, the probability of\nhaving the true value above 1200\\muK^2 (as predicted by the simplest Lambda CDM\nmodel) is 10%, a factor of 2.5 higher than predicted by WMAP likelihood code.\nWe develop a fast likelihood evaluation routine that can be used instead of\nWMAP routines for low l values. We apply it to the MCMC analysis to compare the\ncosmological parameters between the two cases. The new analysis of WMAP either\nalone or jointly with SDSS and VSA reduces the reported 2-sigma evidence for\nrunning to less than 1-sigma, giving \\alpha_s=-0.022\\pm 0.033 for the combined\ncase. The new analysis prefers about 1-sigma lower value of Omega_m, a\nconsequence of an increased ISW contribution required by the increase in the\nspectrum at low l. These results suggest that the details of foreground removal\nand full likelihood analysis are important for the parameter estimation from\nWMAP data and these methods should be particularly useful in the analysis of\npolarisation, where foreground contamination may be much more severe.",

At low\ncoverages, as shown by previous works, `Para' dimers give the lowest energy\nstructure. With increasing coverage beyond 0.5 ML, `Ortho' dimers become part\nof low energy configurations leading toward a `Para' to `Ortho' transition at 1\nML coverage. For In mixed staggered dimers (`Ortho' and `Para') give the lowest\nenergy configuration. For Ga, mixed dimers are non-staggered, while for Al\n`Para' to `Ortho' transition of dimers is complete. Thus at intermediate\ncoverages between 0.5 and 1 ML, the `Ortho' and `Para' dimers may coexist on\nthe surface. Consequently, this may be an explanation of the fact that the\nexperimental observations can be successfully interpreted using either\norientation.

    "summary": "In 1964, Dashen and Frautschi published two papers in the Physical Review\nclaiming that they calculated the neutron-proton mass difference. It was once\nregarded as a history-making calculation, in view of the fact that the proton\nand neutron had been and still are regarded as the same particle with different\nelectromagnetic properties. However, their calculation was shown to be based on\na bound-state wave function which violates the localization condition in\nquantum mechanics.\n  There is one important lesson to be learned from the mistake made by Dashen\nand Frautschi. They did not pay much attention to the fact that there are\nrunning waves and standing waves in quantum mechanics. The S-matrix formalism\nis based on running waves, while bound-state problem are based on normalizable\nwave functions which are standing waves. Wave functions contained in the S\nmatrix are analytic continuations of running waves, and they do not in general\nsatisfy the localization condition for bound states.\n  These days, there are very serious questions raised against string theory. Is\nstring theory a form of quantum field theory? Is it a physical theory or only a\nmathematical exercise. Is a new new Einstein going to emerge from string\ntheory? It is pointed out that, if the distinction is recognized between\nrunning and standing waves, string theory has its place in the historical\nroadmap land-marked by Einstein, Heisenberg, Schr\\\"odinger, Dirac, Wigner, and\nFeynman.",

We have re-examined the EUVE data on this cluster in an attempt\nto obtain clues as to the origin of this emission. We find two important new\nresults. First, the ratio between the azimuthally averaged EUV excess emission\nand the ROSAT hard X-ray flux is constant as a function of distance from the\ncluster center outward. Second, a correlation analysis between the EUV excess\nemission and the X-ray emission shows that on a detailed level the EUV excess\nis spatially closely related to the X-ray emission. These findings contradict\nprevious suggestions as to the underlying source of the diffuse EUV emission in\nComa and provide important information in regards to the true source of this\nemission. We propose a new explanation for the source of this emission: inverse\nCompton scattering of microwave background photons by secondary electrons and\npositrons. We explore this possibility in some detail and show that it is\nconsistent with all of the available observational evidence. The parent cosmic\nray protons may have been produced by any of a number of sources, including\nsupernovae, active galaxies, galactic winds, and cluster formation shocks, but\nwe believe that the most likely source is cluster formation shocks. If the EUV\nemission in the Coma Cluster is, in fact, the result of secondary electrons,\nthis may be the only direct evidence for secondary electrons in the\nintracluster medium of a cluster of galaxies, since recent work suggests that\nsecondary electrons may not be the cause of radio halos.",

Whereas the saddle point value of the gap is\nfound to monotonically increase towards half filling, the phase stiffness at\nT=0 has a maximum, and then decreases with further underdoping. Right at half\nfilling the stiffness vanishes for large U.\n  This argues that the pseudogap phenomenon of the type observed in cuprates is\nin principle possible without a development of any competing order, purely as a\nresult of growing correlations in the superconducting state.

Our major result is that the existence of static metrics on spacetimes\nand that of positive energy representations of symmetry groups, are equivalent\nto the existence of particular Adjoint-invariant convex cones in the symmetry\nalgebras. This can be used to study backgrounds of supergravity and string\ntheories through their symmetry groups. Our formalism is based on Segal's\napproach to infinitesimal causal structures on manifolds. The Adjoint action in\nthe symmetry group is shown to correspond to changes of inertial frames in the\nspacetime, whereas Adjoint-invariance encodes invariance under changes of\nobservers. This allows us to give a group theoretical description of the\nhorizon structure of spacetimes, and also to lift causal structures to the\nHilbert spaces of quantum theories. Among other results, by setting up the\nDirac procedure for the complexified universal algebra, we classify the\nphysically inequivalent observables of quantum theories.

During the circularization of their orbits, the dissipation\nof tidal disturbance by their host stars heats the interior and inflates the\nsizes of these planets. Based on a series of internal structure calculations\nfor giant planets, we examine the physical processes which determine their\nluminosity-radius relation. In order for young or intensely heated gas giant\nplanets to attain quasi-hydrostatic equilibria, with sizes comparable to or\nlarger than two Jupiter radii, their interiors must have sufficiently high\ntemperature and low density such that degeneracy effects are relatively weak\ncompared to those in a mature and compact Jupiter. Consequently, the polytropic\nindex monotonically increases whereas the central temperature increases and\nthen decreases with the planets' size. These effects, along with a\ntemperature-sensitive opacity for the radiative surface layers of giant\nplanets, cause the power index of the luminosity's dependence on radius to\ndecrease with increasing radius. For planets larger than twice Jupiter's\nradius, this index is sufficiently small that they become unstable to tidal\ninflation. We make comparisons between cases of uniform heating and cases in\nwhich the heating is concentrated in various locations within the giant planet.\nBased on these results we suggest that accurate measurement of the sizes of\nclose-in young Jupiters can be used to probe their internal structure under the\ninfluence of tidal heating.",

In addition, it is found that the\ncollapse time decreases rapidly with the increase of the softcore radius. We\nfound that such an anomalously long collapse time is caused by the slow energy\nexchange between a higher-temperature compact core and relatively cold diluted\nhalo. The rate of energy exchange between the faster modes of the core\nparticles and slower-moving particles of the halo is exponentially small in the\nratio of the frequencies of these modes. As the softcore radius increases, and\nthe typical core modes become slower, the ratio of core and halo frequencies\ndecreases and the collapse accelerates.

As a concrete example,\nwe build on earlier work and discuss the implementation of a two-photon\ncontrolled phase gate and a one-photon phase gate using the approximate Kerr\nnonlinearity provided by EIT. We rigorously the dependence of the performance\nof these gates on atomic dephasing and field detuning and intensity, and we\ncalculate the optimum parameters needed to apply a pi phase shift in a gate of\na given fidelity. Although high-fidelity gate operation will be difficult to\nachieve with realistic system dephasing rates, the moderate fidelities that we\nbelieve will be needed for few-qubit QIT seem much more obtainable.",

This phenomenon may often be explained using random time change.\nBecause of some potential applications in mathematical finance, we are\nconsidering mainly the case when $X$ is a Brownian motion with drift $\\mu>0,$\ndenoted $\\{B^{(\\mu)}_t: t\\geq 0\\},$ but it is obvious that the method presented\nis more general.

In this paper, I will describe how Cox's technique can be further\ngeneralized to include other algebras and hence other problems in science and\nmathematics. The result is a methodology that can be used to generalize an\nalgebra to a calculus by relying on consistency with order theory to derive the\nlaws of the calculus. My goals are to clear up the mysteries as to why the same\nbasic structure found in probability theory appears in other contexts, to\nbetter understand the foundations of probability theory, and to extend these\nideas to other areas by developing new mathematics and new physics.

The elastic response of the Eu clathrate\nprovides clear evidence for the existence of a new type of four-well tunneling\nstates, described by two nearly degenerate four level systems (FLS). The FLS's\nare closely linked with the fourfold split positions of Eu known from neutron\ndiffraction density profiles. Using a realistic potential we estimate the\ntunneling frequencies and show that the energy gap between the two FLS's is of\nthe same order as the Einstein oscillator frequency. This explains why the\nobserved harmonic oscillator type specific heat is not modified by tunneling\nstates. In addition the quadrupolar interaction of FLS's with elastic strains\nexplains the pronounced depression observed in elastic constant measurements.\nIn the case of the Sr clathrate, we show that the shallow dip in the elastic\nconstant c44 is explained using the same type of quadrupolar interaction with a\nsoft Einstein mode instead of a FLS.",

    "summary": "Recent computer simulation results [Barrat {\\em et al.}, Physica A 334 (2004)\n513] for granular mixtures subject to stochastic driving have shown the\nvalidity of the Einstein relation $\\epsilon\\equiv D/(T_0\\lambda)=1$ between the\ndiffusion $D$ and mobility $\\lambda$ coefficients when the temperature of the\ngas $T$ is replaced by the temperature of the impurity $T_0$ in the usual\nEinstein relation. This problem is analyzed in this paper by solving\nanalytically the Boltzmann-Lorentz equation from the Chapman-Enskog method. The\ngas is heated by the action of an external driving force (thermostat) which\ndoes work to compensate for the collisional loss of energy. Two types of\nthermostats are considered: (a) a deterministic force proportional to the\nparticle velocity (Gaussian thermostat), and (b) a white noise external force\n(stochastic thermostat). The diffusion and mobility coefficients are given in\nterms of the solutions of two linear integral equations, which are\napproximately solved up to the second order in a Sonine polynomial expansion.\nThe results show that the violation of the Einstein relation ($\\epsilon\\neq 1$)\nis only due to the non-Maxwellian behavior of the impurity velocity\ndistribution function (absence of the Gibbs state). At a quantitative level,\nthe kinetic theory results also show that the deviation of $\\epsilon$ from 1 is\nmore significant in the case of the Gaussian thermostat than in the case of the\nstochastic one, in which case the deviation of the Einstein relation is in\ngeneral smaller than 1%. This conclusion agrees quite well with the results\nfound in computer simulations.",

This model, which usually yields better\nfits than others, is indirectly associated with temporal-domain\nstretched-exponential response having the same beta1 parameter value. Here it\nis shown that for the above conditions several different analyses yield the\nimportant and unique value of exactly 1/3 for the beta1 of the K1 model. It is\ntherefore appropriate to fix the beta1 parameter of this model at the constant\nvalue of 1/3, then defined as the U model. It fits data sets exhibiting\nconductive-system dispersion that vary with both temperature and concentration\njust as well as those with beta1 free to vary, and it leads to a\ncorrespondingly universal value of the Barton-Nakajima-Namikawa (BNN) parameter\np of 1.65. Composite-model complex-nonlinear-least-squares fitting, including\nthe dispersive U-model,the effects of the bulk dipolar-electronic dielectric\nconstant, and of electrode polarization when significant, also leads to\nestimates of two hopping parameters that yield optimum scaling of experimental\ndata that involve temperature and concentration variation.",

    "summary": "We considered the formation of detached white dwarf main-sequence star (WDMS)\nbinaries through seven evolutionary channels subdivided according to the\nevolutionary process that gives rise to the formation of the white dwarf or its\nhelium-star progenitor: dynamically stable Roche-lobe overflow (Algol-type\nevolution), dynamically unstable Roche-lobe overflow (common-envelope\nevolution), or stellar winds (single star evolution). We examine the\nsensitivity of the population to changes in the amount of mass lost from the\nsystem during stable Roche-lobe overflow, the common-envelope ejection\nefficiency, and the initial mass ratio or initial secondary mass distribution.\nIn the case of a flat initial mass ratio distribution, the local space density\nof WDMS binaries is of the order of 10^{-3}/pc^3. This number decreases to\n10^{-4}/pc^3 when the initial mass ratio distribution is approximately\nproportional to the inverse of the initial mass ratio. More than 75% of the\nWDMS binary population stems from wide systems in which both components evolve\nas if they were single stars. The remaining part of the population is dominated\nby systems in which the white dwarf is formed in a common-envelope phase. The\nbirthrate of WDMS binaries forming through a common-envelope phase is about 10\ntimes larger than the birthrate of WDMS binaries forming through a stable\nRoche-lobe overflow phase. The ratio of the number of helium white dwarf\nsystems to the number of carbon/oxygen or oxygen/neon/magnesium white dwarf\nsystems derived from large samples of observed WDMS binaries by, e.g., future\nplanet-search missions such as SuperWASP, COROT, and Kepler may furthermore\nconstrain the common-envelope ejection efficiency.",

VLT\nspectra of the afterglow show damped Lya (DLA) absorption and low- and\nhigh-ionization lines at a redshift z=3.3718+-0.0005. The inferred neutral\nhydrogen column density, log N(HI)=21.90+-0.07, is larger than any (GRB- or\nQSO-) DLA HI column density inferred directly from Lya in absorption. From the\nafterglow photometry, we derive a conservative upper limit to the host-galaxy\nextinction: A(V)<0.5 mag. The iron abundance is [Fe/H]=-1.47+-0.11, while the\nmetallicity of the gas as measured from sulphur is [S/H]=-1.26+-0.20. We derive\nan upper limit on the H2 molecular fraction of 2N(H2)/(2N(H2)+N(HI))<~10^-6. In\nthe Lya trough, a Lya emission line is detected, which corresponds to a\nstar-formation rate (not corrected for dust extinction) of roughly 1 Msun per\nyear. All these results are consistent with the host galaxy of GRB 030323\nconsisting of a low metallicity gas with a low dust content. We detect\nfine-structure lines of silicon, SiII*, which have never been clearly detected\nin QSO-DLAs; this suggests that these lines are produced in the vicinity of the\nGRB explosion site. Under the assumption that these fine-structure levels are\npopulated by particle collisions, we estimate the HI volume density to be\nn_HI=100-10000 cm^-3. HST/ACS imaging 4 months after the burst shows an\nextended AB(F606W)=28.0+-0.3 mag object at a distance of 0.14\" (1kpc) from the\nearly afterglow location, which presumably is the host galaxy of GRB 030323.",

Then, using the\nfinite dimensional distributions of the obtained Wiener measure, we construct a\nnew admissible complex valued continuous Markov process: the Brownian motion.\nWe finished with a geometric analysis of this Brownian motion, to determine the\nrecurrent or transient behavior of such process.",

The notion of CI\nemission as an H$_2$ gas mass tracer challenges the long-held view of its\ndistribution over only a relatively narrow layer in the CII/CI/CO transition\nzone in FUV-illuminated molecular clouds. Past observations have indeed\nconsistently pointed towards a more extended CI distribution but it was only\nrecently, with the advent of large scale imaging of its $^{3}P_{1}\\to\n$$^{3}P_{0}$ transition, that its surprising ubiquity in molecular clouds has\nbeen fully revealed. In the present work we show that under {\\it typical} ISM\nconditions such an ubiquity is inevitable because of well known dynamic and\nnon-equilibrium chemistry processes maintaining a significant [C]/[$ ^{12}$CO]\nabundance throughout Giant Molecular Clouds during their lifetime. These\nprocesses are more intense in star-forming environments where a larger ambient\ncosmic ray flux will also play an important role in boosting [C]/[$ ^{12}$CO].\nThe resulting CI lines can be bright and effective H$_2$ mass tracers\nespecially for diffuse ($\\sim 10^2-10^3\\rm cm^{-3}$) gas while in UV-intense\nand/or metal-poor environments their H$_2$-tracing capability diminishes\nbecause of large scale CII production but nevertheless remains superior to that\nof $ ^{12}$CO.

For a\ngiven black hole there are two closely related surfaces. One is the Riemann\nsurface of complexified ``tortoise'' coordinate. The other Riemann surface\nappears when the radial wave equation is interpreted as the Fuchsian\ndifferential equation. We study these surfaces in detail for the BTZ and\nSchwarzschild black holes in four and higher dimensions. Topologically, in all\ncases both surfaces are a sphere with a set of marked points; for BTZ and 4D\nSchwarzschild black holes there is 3 marked points. In certain limits the\nsurfaces can be characterized very explicitly. We then show how properties of\nthe wave equation (quasi-normal modes) in such limits are encoded in the\ngeometry of the corresponding surfaces. In particular, for the Schwarzschild\nblack hole in the high damping limit we describe the Riemann surface in\nquestion and use this to derive the quasi-normal mode frequencies with the\nlog(3) as the real part. We then argue that the surfaces one finds this way\nsignal an appearance of an effective string. We propose that a description of\nthis effective string propagating in the black hole background can be given in\nterms of the Liouville theory living on the corresponding Riemann surface. We\ngive such a stringy description for the Schwarzschild black hole in the limit\nof high damping and show that the quasi-normal modes emerge naturally as the\npoles in 3-point correlation function in the effective conformal theory.",

Brown dwarfs are never found to be very close companions\nto stars (brown dwarf desert at very small separations), but one case exists of\na brown dwarf companion at intermediate separations (10 AU). Our simulations\ncan accommodate the existence of brown dwarf companions at large separations,\nbut only if the primaries of these systems are themselves multiples.

Such an instrument could detect gamma ray bursts out to a\nredshift of 1, observe flares from active galaxies as short as 15 minutes in\nduration, and survey the overhead sky at a level of 50 mCrab in one year.",

    "summary": "Milagro is a water Cherenkov extensive air shower array that continuously\nmonitors the entire overhead sky in the TeV energy band. The results from an\nanalysis of $\\sim$3 years of data (December 2000 through November 2003) are\npresented. The data has been searched for steady point sources of TeV gamma\nrays between declinations of 1.1 degrees and 80 degrees. Two sources are\ndetected, the Crab Nebula and the active galaxy Mrk 421. For the remainder of\nthe Northern hemisphere we set 95% C.L. upper limits between 275 and 600 mCrab\n(4.8-10.5$\\times 10^{-12}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$) above 1 TeV for source\ndeclinations between 5 degrees and 70 degrees. Since the sensitivity of Milagro\ndepends upon the spectrum of the source at the top of the atmosphere, the\ndependence of the limits on the spectrum of a candidate source is presented.\nBecause high-energy gamma rays from extragalactic sources are absorbed by\ninteractions with the extragalactic background light the dependence of the flux\nlimits on the redshift of a candidate source are given. The upper limits\npresented here are over an order of magnitude more stringent than previously\npublished limits from TeV gamma-ray all-sky surveys.",

The space $\\CM$ of self-adjoint\nextensions of the covariant Laplacian on $M$ is shown to have interesting\ngeometrical and topological properties which are related to the different\ntopological closures of $M$. In this sense, the change of topology of $M$ is\nconnected with the non-trivial structure of $\\CM$. The space $\\CM$ itself can\nbe identified with the unitary group $\\CU(L^2(\\Gamma,\\C^N))$ of the Hilbert\nspace of boundary data $L^2(\\Gamma,\\C^N)$. A particularly interesting family of\nboundary conditions, identified as the set of unitary operators which are\nsingular under the Cayley transform, $\\CC_-\\cap \\CC_+$ (the Cayley manifold),\nturns out to play a relevant role in topology change phenomena. The singularity\nof the Cayley transform implies that some energy levels, usually associated\nwith edge states, acquire an infinity energy when by an adiabatic change the\nboundary condition reaches the Cayley submanifold $\\CC_-$. In this sense\ntopological transitions require an infinite amount of quantum energy to occur,\nalthough the description of the topological transition in the space $\\CM$ is\nsmooth.

We\nconclude that the method does have the potential to do just that, but great\ncare must be taken both in implementation, and in a detailed understanding of\nlimitations caused by residual foregrounds which can still affect cosmological\nresults. As a first step we demonstrate how to compute the ILC weights both\naccurately and efficiently by means of Lagrange multipliers, and apply this\nmethod to the observed data to produce a new version of the ILC map. Next we\ndescribe how to generate Monte Carlo simulations of the ILC map, and find that\nthese agree well with the observed map on angular scales up to l~200. Finally\nwe make two comments to the on-going debates concerning the large-scale\nproperties of the WMAP data. First, we note that the Galactic south-eastern\nquadrant is associated with notably different ILC weights than the other three\nquadrants, possibly indicating a foreground related anisotropy. Second, we\nstudy the properties of the quadrupole and octopole (amplitude, alignment and\nplanarity), and confirm the previously reported anomalies. Even more\ninterestingly, we find that the l=5 mode is spherically symmetric at about 3\nsigma, and that the l=6 mode is planar at the 2 sigma level. However, we also\nassess the impact of residual foregrounds on these statistics, and find that\nthe ILC map is not clean enough to allow for cosmological conclusions.\nAlternative methods must be developed to study these issues further.",

    "summary": "Although atmospheric transmission spectroscopy of HD209458b with the Hubble\nSpace Telescope has been very successful, attempts to detect its atmospheric\nabsorption features using ground-based telescopes have so far been fruitless.\nHere we present a new method for probing the atmospheres of transiting\nexoplanets which may be more suitable for ground-based observations, making use\nof the Rossiter effect. During a transit, an exoplanet sequentially blocks off\nlight from the approaching and receding parts of the rotating star, causing an\nartificial radial velocity wobble. The amplitude of this signal is directly\nproportional to the effective size of the transiting object, and the wavelength\ndependence of this effect can reveal atmospheric absorption features, in a\nsimilar way as with transmission spectroscopy. The advantage of this method\nover conventional atmospheric transmission spectroscopy is that it does not\nrely on accurate photometric comparisons of observations on and off transit,\nbut instead depends on the relative velocity shifts of individual stellar\nabsorption lines within the same on-transit spectra. We used an archival\nVLT/UVES data set to apply this method to HD209458. The amplitude of the\nRossiter effect is shown to be 1.7+-1.2 m/sec higher in the Sodium D lines than\nin the weighted average of all other absorption lines in the observed\nwavelength range, corresponding to an increment of 4.3+-3% (1.4 sigma). The\nuncertainty in this measurement compares to a photometric accuracy of 5e-4 for\nconventional atmospheric transmission spectroscopy, more than an order of\nmagnitude higher than previous attempts using ground-based telescopes.\nObservations specifically designed for this method could increase the accuracy\nfurther by a factor 2-3.",

Furthermore, as cavity\ncooling does not rely on spontaneous emission, it can be applied to systems\nthat cannot be laser-cooled by conventional methods; these include molecules\n(which do not have a closed transition) and collective excitations of Bose\ncondensates, which are destroyed by randomly directed recoil kicks. Here we\ndemonstrate cavity cooling of single rubidium atoms stored in an intracavity\ndipole trap. The cooling mechanism results in extended storage times and\nimproved localization of atoms.

Much of the\nextraplanar gas exhibits a modest net blueshift with respect to the galaxy's\ndisk rotational velocities, consistent with gas accelerated toward the mean\ncluster velocity.

The galaxy is 3.3 degrees ~800 kpc from\nM87, somewhat outside the region of strongest cluster X-ray emission. The ram\npressure may be significantly stronger than standard values, due to large bulk\nmotions and local density enhancements of the ICM gas, which may occur in a\ndynamic, shock-filled ICM experiencing subcluster merging.

    "summary": "We use a physically motivated semi-analytic model, based on the mass function\nof dark matter halos, to predict the number of radio-loud quasars as a function\nof redshift and luminosity. Simple models in which the central BH mass scales\nwith the velocity dispersion of its host halo as M(bh) sigma(halo)^5 have been\npreviously found to be consistent with a number of observations, including the\noptical and X-ray quasar luminosity functions. We find that similar models,\nwhen augmented with an empirical prescription for radio emission, overpredict\nthe number of faint (10 micro-Jy) radio sources by 1-2 orders of magnitude.\nThis translates into a more stringent constraint on the low-mass end of the\nquasar black hole mass function than is available from the Hubble and Chandra\nDeep Fields. We interpret this discrepancy as evidence that black holes with\nmasses below 10^7 Msun are either rare or are not as radio-loud as their more\nmassive counterparts. Models that exclude BHs with masses below 10^7 Msun are\nin agreement with the deepest existing radio observations, but still produce a\nsignificant tail of high-redshift objects. In the 1-10GHz bands, at the\nsensitivity of 10 micro-Jy, we find surface densities of 100, 10, and 0.3\ndeg^-2 for sources located at z>6, 10, and 15, respectively. The discovery of\nthese sources with instruments such as the Allen Telescope Array (ATA),\nExtended Very Large Array (EVLA), and the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) would\nopen a new window for the study of supermassive BHs at high redshift. We also\nfind surface densities of 0.1 deg^-2 at z > 6 for mJy sources that can be used\nto study 21 cm absorption from the epoch of reionization.

The abundance of a-elements (most accurately determined by Si) is also\nfound to be super-solar.

In this work, we continue our investigation of the\nnotion of generalized entanglement [Barnum et al. Phys. Rev. A 68, 032308\n(2003)] by focusing on a simple Lie-algebraic measure of purity of a quantum\nstate relative to an observable set. For the algebra of local observables on\nmulti-qubit systems, the resulting local purity measure is equivalent to a\nrecently introduced global entanglement measure [Meyer and Wallach, J. Math.\nPhys. 43, 4273 (2002)]. In the condensed-matter setting, the notion of\nLie-algebraic purity is exploited to identify and characterize the quantum\nphase transitions present in two exactly solvable models: the\nLipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, and the spin-1/2 anisotropic XY model in a\ntransverse magnetic field. For the latter, we argue that a natural fermionic\nobservable-set arising after the Jordan-Wigner transformation, better\ncharacterizes the transition than alternative measures based on qubits. This\nillustrates the usefulness of going beyond the standard subsystem-based\nframework while providing a global disorder parameter for this model. Our\nresults show how generalized entanglement leads to useful tools for\ndistinguishing between the ordered and disordered phases in the case of broken\nsymmetry quantum phase transitions. Additional implications and possible\nextensions of concepts to other systems of interest in condensed matter physics\nare also discussed.",

    "summary": "Translated into the language of representations of quivers, a challenge in\nmatrix pencil theory is to find sufficient and necessary conditions for a\nKronecker representation to be a subfactor of another Kronecker representation\nin terms of their Kronecker invariants. The problem is reduced to a numerical\ncriterion for a Kronecker representation to be a subrepresentation of another\nKronecker representation in terms of their Kronecker invariants. The key to the\nproblem is the calculation of ranks of matrices over polynomial rings. For\nthis, a generalization and specialization approach is introduced. This approach\nis applied to provide a numerical criterion for a preprojective (resp. regular,\npreinjective) Kronecker representation to be a subrepresentation of another\npreprojective (resp. regular, preinjective) Kronecker representation in terms\nof their Kronecker invariants.",

In doing so, we\nderive an ordinary differential equation model that explores how the balance of\nangiogenesis, cell death rates, genetic instability, and replication rates give\nrise to different kinetics in the development of cancer. The key predictions of\nthe model are that cancer develops fastest through a particular ordering of\nmutations and that mutations in genes that maintain genomic integrity would be\nthe most deleterious type of mutations to inherit. In addition, we perform a\nsensitivity analysis on the parameters included in the model to determine the\nprobable contribution of each.

SiO lines were also detected from 16 other resulting in 180\ndetections. SiO lines were also detected from 16 other sources, which are\nlocated within 20\" (the telescope half beamwidth) of the program objects. The\ndetection rate of 48 percent is comparable to that obtained in Bulge IRAS\nsource surveys. Among the SiO detections, five stars have radial velocities\ngreater than 200 km/s. The SiO detection rate increases steeply with the period\nof light variation, particularly for stars with P>500 d, where it exceeds 80%.\nWe found that, at a given period, the SiO detection rate is approximately three\ntimes that for OH. These facts suggest that the large-amplitude variables in\nthe Nuclear Disk region are AGB stars similar in their overall properties to\nthe inner and outer Bulge IRAS/SiO sources. From the set of radial velocity\ndata, the mass distribution within 30 pc of the galactic center is derived by a\nnew method which is based on the collisionless Boltzmann equation integrated\nalong the line of sight. The mass within 30 pc is about 6.4 [\\pm 0.7] \\times\n10^7 M_{\\odot} and the mass of the central black hole is 2.7 [\\pm 1.3] \\times\n10^6 M_{\\odot}. Consideration of the line-of-sight velocity of each star and\nits potential energy leads to the conclusion that the five high-velocity stars\ncome from galactocentric distances as high as 300 pc. The high-velocity\nsubsample of stars with negative radial velocities exhibits a tendency to have\nbrighter K magnitudes than the subsample of stars with positive velocities. The\norigin of these high-velocity stars is discussed.",

    "summary": "We survey a number of models from physics, statistical mechanics, probability\ntheory and combinatorics, which are each described in terms of an orthogonal\npolynomial ensemble. The most prominent example is apparently the Hermite\nensemble, the eigenvalue distribution of the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE),\nand other well-known ensembles known in random matrix theory like the Laguerre\nensemble for the spectrum of Wishart matrices. In recent years, a number of\nfurther interesting models were found to lead to orthogonal polynomial\nensembles, among which the corner growth model, directed last passage\npercolation, the PNG droplet, non-colliding random processes, the length of the\nlongest increasing subsequence of a random permutation, and others. Much\nattention has been paid to universal classes of asymptotic behaviors of these\nmodels in the limit of large particle numbers, in particular the spacings\nbetween the particles and the fluctuation behavior of the largest particle.\nComputer simulations suggest that the connections go even farther and also\ncomprise the zeros of the Riemann zeta function. The existing proofs require a\nsubstantial technical machinery and heavy tools from various parts of\nmathematics, in particular complex analysis, combinatorics and variational\nanalysis. Particularly in the last decade, a number of fine results have been\nachieved, but it is obvious that a comprehensive and thorough understanding of\nthe matter is still lacking. Hence, it seems an appropriate time to provide a\nsurveying text on this research area.",

Biological evolution\nhas generated a rich variety of successful solutions, which have inspired\nengineers to design optimized artificial systems. Foraging ants, for example,\nform attractive trails that support the exploitation of initially unknown food\nsources in almost the minimum possible time. However, can this strategy cope\nwith bottleneck situations, when interactions cause delays that reduce the\noverall flow? Here, we present an experimental study of ants confronted with\ntwo alternative routes. We find that pheromone-based attraction generates one\ntrail at low densities, whereas at a high level of crowding, another trail is\nestablished before traffic volume is affected, which guarantees that an optimal\nrate of food return is maintained. This bifurcation phenomenon is explained by\na nonlinear modelling approach. Surprisingly, the underlying mechanism is based\non inhibitory interactions. It implies capacity reserves, a limitation of the\ndensity-induced speed reduction, and a sufficient pheromone concentration for\nreliable trail perception. The balancing mechanism between cohesive and\ndispersive forces appears to be generic in natural, urban and transportation\nsystems.",

Firstly, the WFCs expanded the known population of Galactic\nthermonuclear X-ray bursters by 50%. At least half of all LMXBs are now\nestablished to burst and, thus, to contain a neutron star as compact accretor\nrather than a black hole candidate.

One is the\nfirst accretion-powered millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658. Thirdly, the WFCs\ncontributed considerably towards establishing that nearly all (12 out of 13)\nluminous low-mass X-ray binaries in Galactic globular clusters contain neutron\nstars rather than black holes.

The law proves that universal\nmortality is an evolutionary byproduct, which at any age is reversible,\nindependent of previous life history, and may be disposable. Recent experiments\nverify these predictions. Life expectancy may be extended, arguably to\nimmortality, by relatively small and universal biological amendments in the\nanimals. Indeed, it doubled with improving conditions in humans; increased\n2.4-fold with genotype change in Drosophila, and 6-fold (to 430 years in human\nterms), with no apparent loss in health and vitality, in nematodes with a small\nnumber of perturbed genes and tissues.

The lower ionization transitions arise in\ntwo kinematic subsystems with a separation of ~150 km/s. Each subsystem is\nresolved into several narrow components, having Doppler widths of 3-10 kms. For\nboth subsystems, the OVI absorption arises in a separate higher ionization\nphase, in regions dominated by bulk motions in the range of 30-40 km/s. The two\nOVI absorption profiles are kinematically offset by ~50 km/s with respect to\neach of the two lower ionization subsystem. In the stronger subsystem, the\nSiIII absorption is strong with a distinctive, smooth profile shape and may\npartially arise in shock heated gas. Moreover, the kinematic substructure of\nSiIV traces that of the lower ionization MgII, but may be offset by ~3 km/s.\nBased upon photoionization models, constrained by the partial Lyman limit\nbreak, we infer a low metallicity of ~0.03 solar for the low ionization gas in\nboth subsystems. The broader OVI phases have a somewhat higher metallicity, and\nthey are consistent with photoionization; the profiles are not broad enough to\nimply production of OVI through collisional ionization. Various models,\nincluding outer disks, dwarf galaxies, and superwinds, are discussed to account\nfor the phase structure, metallicity, and kinematics of this absorption system.\nWe favor an interpretation in which the two subsystems are produced by\ncondensed clouds far out in the opposite extremes of a multi-layer dwarf galaxy\nsuperwind.",

Using a\nlinear MHD solver, we first systematically chart the destabilized wavenumbers,\ncorresponding growth rates, and physical parameter ranges for dominant 3D\nsinuous-type instabilities in an equilibrium wake--current sheet system. Wakes\nbounded by sufficiently supersonic (Mach number $M_s > 2.6$) flow streams are\nfound to support dominant fully 3D sinuous instabilities when the plasma beta\nis of order unity.

Powder X-ray diffraction revealed a change of the crystal\nstructure from tetragonally compressed to tetragonally elongated orthorhombic\nbetween x=0.75 and x=0.8 in the CO state, resulting from the crossover of the\ncooperative Jahn-Teller vibration mode from Q2 to Q3.

Fitting the model\nwith the observed bimodal distribution of GRBs' durations, the ejecta's initial\nLorentz factor, and its initial opening angle are obtained as\n$\\Gamma_{0}\\lesssim 10^{3}$, and $\\zeta_{0} \\approx 10^{-2}$, and the mean\ndensity and mean thickness of the surrounding cloud as $\\bar{n} \\sim 3 \\times\n10^{17} cm^{-3}$ and $\\bar{L} \\sim 2 \\times 10^{13} cm$. The clouds maybe\ninterpreted as the extremely amorphous envelops of Thorne-Zytkow objects. In\nthis model the two classes of long and short duration GRBs are explained in a\nunique frame.",

For a variety of 1D, 2D, and 3D hydro- and\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulations, AMR is used in combination with several\nshock-capturing, conservative discretization schemes. Solution accuracy and\nexecution times are compared with static grid simulations at the corresponding\nhigh resolution and time spent on AMR overhead is reported. Our examples reach\ncorresponding efficiencies of 5 to 20 in multidimensional calculations and only\n1.5 -- 8 % overhead is observed. For AMR calculations of multi-dimensional\nmagnetohydrodynamic problems, several strategies for controlling the $\\nabla\n\\cdot \\BB =0$ constraint are examined. Three source term approaches suitable\nfor cell-centered $\\BB$ representations are shown to be effective. For 2D and\n3D calculations where a transition to a more globally turbulent state takes\nplace, it is advocated to use an approximate Riemann solver based\ndiscretization at the highest allowed level(s), in combination with the robust\nTotal Variation Diminishing Lax-Friedrichs method on the coarser levels. This\nlevel-dependent use of the spatial discretization acts as a computationally\nefficient, hybrid scheme.",

First, the calculations extend previous studies of\nmagnetized shear flows to a higher compressibility regime. The nonlinear\nevolution of an isolated KH billow emerging from the fastest growing linear\nmode for a convective sonic Mach number $M_{cs}=0.7$ layer is in many respects\nsimilar to its less compressible counterpart (Mach $M_{cs}=0.5$). In\nparticular, the disruptive regime where locally amplified, initially weak\nmagnetic fields, control the nonlinear saturation process is found for Alfv\\'en\nMach numbers $4\\simlt M_A \\simlt 30$. The most notable difference between\n$M_{cs}=0.7$ versus $M_{cs}=0.5$ layers is that higher density contrasts and\nfast magnetosonic shocklet structures are observed. Second, the use of adaptive\nmesh refinement allows to parametrically explore much larger computational\ndomains, including up to 22 wavelengths of the linearly dominant mode. A strong\nprocess of large-scale coalescence is found, whatever the magnetic field\nregime. It proceeds through continuous pairing/merging events between adjacent\nvortices up to the point where the final large-scale vortical structure reaches\nthe domain dimensions. This pairing/merging process is attributed to the growth\nof subharmonic modes and is mainly controlled by relative phase differences\nbetween them. These grid-adaptive simulations demonstrate that even in very\nweak magnetic field regimes ($M_A \\simeq 30$), the large-scale KH coalescence\nprocess can trigger tearing-type reconnection events previously identified in\ncospatial current-vortex sheets.",

The\npurpose of this paper is to continue the structure theory of finite dimensional\nquasi-Hopf algebras started in math.QA/0310253 (p=2) and math.QA/0402159 (p>2).\nMore specifically, we completely describe the class RG(p) for p>2. Namely, we\nshow that if H\\in RG(p) has a nontrivial associator, then the rank of H[1] over\nH[0] is \\le 1. This yields the following classification of H\\in RG(p), p>2, up\nto twist equivalence: (a) Duals of pointed Hopf algebras with p grouplike\nelements, classified in math.QA/9806074. (b) Group algebra of Z_p with\nassociator defined by a 3-cocycle. (c) The algebras A(q), introduced in\nmath.QA/0402159. This result implies, in particular, that if p>2 is a prime\nthen any finite tensor category over C with exactly p simple objects which are\nall invertible must have Frobenius-Perron dimension p^N, N=1,2,3,4,5 or 7. In\nthe second half of the paper we construct new examples of finite dimensional\nquasi-Hopf algebras H, which are not twist equivalent to a Hopf algebra. They\nare radically graded, and H/Rad(H)=C[Z_n^m], with a nontrivial associator. For\ninstance, to every finite dimensional simple Lie algebra g and an odd integer\nn, coprime to 3 if g=G_2, we attach a quasi-Hopf algebra of dimension\nn^{dim(g)}.",

We show numerically\nthat the local limited (LL) model exhibits a crossover from multifractal to\nself-similar behavior as the control parameters $h_{ext}$ and $\\epsilon$ turn\ntowards their critical values, i.e. $h_{ext} \\to 0^+ $ and $\\epsilon \\to\n\\epsilon_c$. The critical exponents are not universal and exhibit a continuous\nvariation with $\\epsilon$. On the other hand, the finite size effects for the\nlocal unlimited (LU), non local limited (NLL), and non local unlimited (NLU)\nmodels are well described by the multifractal analysis for all values of\ndissipation rate $\\epsilon$. The space-time avalanche structure is studied in\norder to give a deeper understanding of the finite size effects and the origin\nof the crossover behavior. This result is confirmed by the calculation of the\nsusceptibility.",

    "summary": "The results of analysis of HST I-band imaging of a sample of 41 radio\ngalaxies spanning three orders of magnitude in radio luminosity at redshift\nz~0.5 are presented. The full sample is drawn from four complete, low-frequency\nselected radio samples with progressively fainter flux-density limits (3CRR,\n6CE, 7CRS and the new TexOx-1000 sample). Modelling of the HST imaging data\nshows that the host galaxies have surface-brightness distributions consistent\nwith those expected for classic ellipticals (Sersic parameter, beta~0.25), with\nbeta in the range 0.17<beta<0.30, and a mean of <beta>=0.23\\pm0.01. The\nhost-galaxy luminosities are comparable with those of galaxies drawn from the\nbright end of the local cluster galaxy luminosity function, spanning the range\n0.7L^{\\star}<L<10L^{\\star}, with a mean of 3.2\\pm0.3 L^{\\star}. In addition,\nthe radio galaxies are shown to follow a Kormendy relation indistinguishable\nfrom that of powerful low-redshift radio galaxies. Combining our new results\nwith those in the literature it is found that the scalelengths and Kormendy\nrelations of 3C-class radio galaxies do not vary significantly over the\nredshift range 0.0<z<0.8, providing no evidence for dynamical evolution of this\nclass of host galaxy within this redshift interval. Converting the host-galaxy\nluminosities into black-hole mass estimates predicts that the radio galaxies\nharbour central black holes with masses in the range 10^{8.1}\\Msun <M_{bh}<\n10^{9.5}\\Msun, with a geometric mean of <M_{bh}>=10^{8.87\\pm 0.04}\\Msun.\nFinally, a significant (~3 sigma) correlation is found between black-hole mass\nand 151-MHz radio luminosity for those objects in the sample with either\nhigh-excitation nuclear spectra or classical double radio structures.\n(abridged)",

The fractional diffusion model reproduces the shape, and\nspace-time scaling of the non-Gaussian pdf of turbulent transport calculations.\nThe model also reproduces the observed super-diffusive scaling.",

The low temperature results\nindicate that long range antiferromagnetic order is stable up to x=0.2, while\nbetween 0.25 and 0.5 magnetic disorder gives rise to non-Fermi-liquid (NFL)\nbehavior. In this region, the low temperature specific heat can be described by\nthe sum of two components, the major one showing a C_P/T=gamma_0 -gamma_1\nT^(1/2) dependence, while the minor one includes a decreasing number of degrees\nof freedom related to a residue of short range order. The latter extrapolates\nto zero between 0.45<x_{cr}<0.5. Electrical resistivity (rho) studies performed\nunder pressure for x=0.5 allow to investigate the evolution of the NFL state\nright above the critical point, where the exponent of rho ~ T^n is found to\nincrease from n=1 (for p=0) up to n=2 (for p=12 kbar). The latter is observed\nfor x=1.0 already at normal pressure, indicating the onset of the Fermi Liquid\nbehavior. Doping and pressure effects are compared by fitting high temperature\nresistivity data employing a unique function which allows to describe the\nevolution of the characteristic energy of this series through a large range of\nconcentration and pressure.",

    "summary": "Much recent discussion about dark matter has been centered on two seemingly\nindependent problems: the abundance of substructure in dark matter halos, and\nthe cuspiness of the halos' inner density profile. We explore possible\nconnections between the two problems by studying the gravitational scattering\neffects due to subhalos on the phase-space distribution of dark matter\nparticles in the main halos. Our series of controlled numerical experiments\nindicates that the number and mass density of subhalos can be high enough to\ncause the collisionless dark matter particles in the inner part of a main halo\nto diffuse, flattening the main halo's inner cusp within a few dynamical times.\nDepending on the masses and concentration of the subhalos, the inner density\nprofile of the whole system (main plus sub halos) can either steepen or\nflatten. Subhalo accretion can therefore introduce significant scatter in the\ninner density profiles of dark matter halos, offering a possible explanation\nfor the range of profiles seen in both observations and cosmological\nsimulations.",

Nonetheless, strategies\ntaking advantage of correlation do exist for some special classes of quantum\nsources. For example, Devetak and Winter demonstrated the existence of such a\nstrategy when one of the sources is classical.

Unusually strong HI, H-alpha and radio continuum\nemission are all detected from the extraplanar gas. The radio continuum\npolarized flux and spectral index peak on the side opposite the extraplanar\ngas, suggesting ongoing pressure by the ICM. Four other HI-deficient edge-on\nVirgo spirals show evidence of extraplanar ISM gas or exhibit asymmetries in\ntheir disk HI distributions, but contain much less extraplanar HI than NGC\n4522. Comparison with recent simulations suggests this difference may be\nevolutionary, with large surface densities of extraplanar gas observed only in\nearly phases of an ICM-ISM interaction. In NGC 4569, the H-alpha image shows 2\neffects of ICM pressure on the galaxy ISM. An anomalous arm of HII regions,\npossibly extraplanar, emerges from the edge of a truncated H-alpha disk. This\nresembles the arms seen in simulations which are formed by the combined effects\nof wind pressure plus rotation. An extended nebulosity near the minor axis,\nalso in the NW, is interpreted as a starburst outflow bubble disturbed by ICM\nwind pressure.",

Unlike most past sub-mm studies, our\nsample was chosen on the basis of stellar age. Our observations achieve about\nan order of magnitude greater sensitivity in dust mass compared to previous\nwork in this age range. We detected two of the three M dwarfs in our sample at\n850 um, GJ 182 and GJ 803. GJ 182 may also possess a 25 um excess, indicative\nof warm dust in the inner few AU of its disk. For GJ 803 (AU Mic), sub-mm\nmapping finds that the 850 um emission is unresolved. A non-detection of the CO\n3-2 line indicates the system is gas-poor, and the SED suggests the presence of\na large inner disk hole (~17 AU = 1.7 arcsec in radius). These are possible\nindications that planets at large separations can form around M dwarfs within\n\\~10 Myr. In a companion paper (Kalas, Liu & Matthews 2004), we confirm the\nexistence of a dust disk around GJ 803 using optical coronagraphic imaging.\nGiven its youthfulness, proximity, and detectability, the GJ 803 disk will be a\nvaluable system for studying disk, and perhaps planet, formation in great\ndetail. Overall, sub-mm measurements of debris disks point to a drop in dust\nmass by a factor of about 10^3 within the first ~10 Myr, with the subsequent\ndecline in the masses of sub-mm detected disks consistent with t^{-0.5} to\nt^{-1}.",

Since the image of a point depends on scattered photons which passed up\nto 2 cm away from the object (for 4 cm thick phantom), we identify the\nbackground definition as a main source of systematic uncertainty in the image\nquality analysis. We propose the use of two dimensional functions (a polynomial\nfor the background and Gaussians for the signal) for total photon transmission\ndescription. Our main results indicate the possible calcification thickness\nreconstruction with an accuracy of the order of 6% using 3 mm wide scanning\nbeam.

It is clear that not only the assumption of distinguishability, but\nalso the few-subsystem scenario, are too narrow to embrace all possible\nphysical settings. In particular, the need to go beyond the traditional\nsubsystem-based framework becomes manifest when one tries to apply the\nconventional concept of entanglement to the physics of matter, since the\nconstituents of a quantum many-body system are indistinguishable particles. We\nshall discuss here a notion of generalized entanglement, which can be applied\nto any operator language (fermions, bosons, spins, etc.) used to describe a\nphysical system and which includes the conventional entanglement settings\nintroduced to date in a unified fashion. This is realized by noticing that\nentanglement is an observer-dependent concept, whose properties are determined\nby the expectations of a distinguished set of observables without reference to\na preferred subsystem decomposition, i.e., it depends on the physically\nrelevant point of view. This viewpoint depends in turn upon the relationship\nbetween different sets of observables that determine our ability to control the\nsystem of interest. Indeed, the extent to which entanglement is present depends\non the observables used to measure a system and describe its states. This\nrepresents a most conspicuous advantage as will be highlighted by the\ncondensed-matter application we will discuss.",

This problem is overcome by a transformation which provides\ndirectly the ``point-curve'' representation of a curve. Earlier this was\napplied to conics and their generalizations. Here the representation, also\ncalled dual, is extended to all planar algebraic curves. Specifically, it is\nshown that the dual of an algebraic curve of degree $n$ is an algebraic of\ndegree at most $n(n - 1)$ in the absence of singular points. The result that\nconics map into conics follows as an easy special case. An algorithm, based on\nalgebraic geometry using resultants and homogeneous polynomials, is obtained\nwhich constructs the dual image of the curve. This approach has potential\ngeneralizations to multi-dimensional algebraic surfaces and their\napproximation.

The method is based on Delaunay tessellation, where $v(f)$ is\nobtained with an effective fixed smoothing window over a wide $f$ range. The\nerrors are estimated, and $v(f)$ is found to be insensitive to the sampling\nresolution or the simulation technique. We find that in gravitationally relaxed\nhaloes built by hierarchical clustering, $v(f)$ is well approximated by a\nrobust power law, $v(f) \\propto f^{-2.5 \\pm 0.05}$, over more than 4 decades in\n$f$, from its virial level to the numerical resolution limit. This is tested to\nbe valid in the $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology for haloes with masses\n$10^9-10^{15}\\msun$, indicating insensitivity to the slope of the initial\nfluctuation power spectrum. By mapping the phase-space density in position\nspace, we find that the high-$f$ end of $v(f)$ is dominated by the ``cold''\nsubhaloes rather than the parent-halo central region and its global spherical\nprofile. The value of $f$ in subhaloes near the virial radius is typically\n$>100$ times higher than its value at the halo centre, and it decreases\ngradually from outside in toward its value at the halo centre. This seems to\nreflect phase mixing due to mergers and tidal effects involving puffing up and\nheating. The phase-space density can thus provide a sensitive tool for studying\nthe evolution of subhaloes during the hierarchical buildup of haloes. It\nremains to be understood why the evolved substructure adds up to the actual\nuniversal power law of $v(f) \\propto f^{-2.5}$. It seems that this behaviour\nresults from the hierarchical clustering process and is not a general result of\nviolent relaxation.",

The Canis Major GCs, and\nthose associated with the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, exhibit a range of\ngalactocentric radii, prograde and retrograde motions, and horizontal branch\nmorphologies, indicating that such properties are of limited use in identifying\naccreted GCs. By contrast, we find that the age-metallicity relation (AMR) of\nthese dwarf galaxies is distinct from that of the main Galactic GC distribution\nat intermediate-to-high metallicities ([Fe/H] > -1.3). The accretion of GCs\nwith a distinct AMR would explain much of the apparent age spread in the\nGalactic GC system. The Canis Major and Sagittarius AMRs are similar to those\nof other Local Group dwarf galaxies and are consistent with a simple closed-box\nchemical enrichment model -- a further indication that these GCs formed outside\nof the Milky Way. The Canis Major GCs all have smaller-than-average sizes for\ntheir galactocentric distances, lending further support to their origin outside\nof the Milky Way. Our findings suggest that accretion of similar mass dwarfs\ndoes not appear to have played a major role in building the stellar mass of the\nthick disk or bulge of the Milky Way.",

We present an analysis of sideband-separated, digitally\nsampled data recorded by the array. Based on 215 hours of data taken in late\n2001, we set an upper limit on the CMB anisotropy in a band of width Delta\nell=700 around ell=1540 of delta T < 105 microK (95% conf).

These calculations\nare used for predicting the Galactic diffuse gamma-ray spectrum that may be\ncontributed by baryonic dark matter; the results are compared with data from\nthe EGRET instrument, and used to constrain the fraction of Galactic dark\nmatter that may be in the form of dense gas clouds. In agreement with previous\nauthors, we find useful constraints on the fraction of Galactic dark matter\nthat may be in the form of low column-density clouds ($\\Sigma \\la 10 g\ncm^{-2}$). However, this fraction rises steeply in the region $\\Sigma \\sim 10^2\ng cm^{-2}$, and for $\\Sigma \\ga 200 g cm^{-2}$ we find that baryonic dark\nmatter models are virtually unconstrained by the existing gamma-ray data.",

Our findings\nare supported by two independent procedures; one based on the regularity of the\non-horizon geometry and another that directly utilizes the elegant nature of a\nbifurcate Killing horizon.

We derive the equations of motion for the angular speed of\nthe roller tape, the peel angle and the pull force used in earlier\ninvestigations using a Lagrangian. Due to the constraint between the pull\nforce, peel angle and the peel force, it falls into the category of\ndifferential-algebraic equations requiring an appropriate algorithm for its\nnumerical solution. Using such a scheme, we show that stick-slip jumps emerge\nin a purely dynamical manner. Our detailed numerical study shows that these set\nof equations exhibit rich dynamics hitherto not reported. In particular, our\nanalysis shows that inertia has considerable influence on the nature of the\ndynamics. Following studies in the Portevin-Le Chatelier effect, we suggest a\nphenomenological peel force function which includes the influence of the pull\nspeed. This reproduces the decreasing nature of the rupture force with the pull\nspeed observed in experiments. This rich dynamics is made transparent by using\na set of approximations valid in different regimes of the parameter space. The\napproximate solutions capture major features of the exact numerical solutions\nand also produce reasonably accurate values for the various quantities of\ninterest.",

The near-infrared survey covers an area of ~ 24 sq.\narcmin with 10 sigma limiting magnitudes of ~ 19.0, 18.1, and 17.3 in J, H, and\nKs-band, respectively. We construct JHK color-color and J/J-H and K/H-K\ncolor-magnitude diagrams to identify young stellar objects and estimate their\nmasses. Based on these color-color and color-magnitude diagrams, a rich\npopulation of YSOs is identified which is associated with the W3 Main region. A\nlarge number of previously unreported red sources (H-K > 2) have also been\ndetected around W3 Main. We argue that these red stars are most probably\npre-main sequence stars with intrinsic color excesses. We find that the slope\nof the Ks-band luminosity function of W3 Main is lower than the typical values\nreported for the young embedded clusters. The derived slope of the KLF is the\nsame as that found by Megeath et al. (1996), from which analysis by Megeath et\nal. indicates that the W3 Main region has an age in the range of 0.3--1 Myr.\nBased on the comparison between models of pre-main sequence stars with the\nobserved color-magnitude diagram we find that the stellar population in W3 Main\nis primarily composed of low mass pre-main sequence stars. We also report the\ndetection of isolated young stars with large infrared excesses which are most\nprobably in their earliest evolutionary phases.",

The particles are connected by\ntwo-dimensional harmonic springs together with bending angle interactions. The\nproblem is analyzed by mode-coupling theory and compared with molecular\ndynamics. We find very good, quantitative agreement for the damping of modes\nbetween a full mode-coupling theory and molecular dynamics result, and a\nsimplified mode-coupling theory gives qualitative description of the damping.\nThe theories predict generically that thermal conductance diverges as N^{1/3}\nas the size N increases for systems terminated with heat baths at the ends. The\nN^{2/5} dependence is also observed in molecular dynamics which we attribute to\ncrossover effect.",

HD 81809 is a G2-type star (somewhat\nmore evolved than the Sun, and with a less massive companion) with a pronounced\n8.2 yr chromospheric cycle, as evident from from the Mt. Wilson program data.\nWe present here the results from the initial 2.5 years of XMM observations,\nshowing that large amplitude (a factor of approx. 10) modulation is present in\nthe X-ray luminosity, with a clearly defined maximum in mid 2002 and a steady\ndecrease since then. The maximum of the chromospheric cycle took place in 2001;\nif the observed X-ray variability is the initial part of an X-ray cycle, this\ncould imply a phase shift between chromospheric and coronal activity, although\nthe current descent into chromospheric cycle minimum is well reflected into the\nstar's X-ray luminosity. The observations presented here provide clear evidence\nfor the presence of large amplitude X-ray variability coherent with the\nactivity cycle in the chromosphere in a star other than the Sun.",

For four of\nthese temporal classes $D_2 $ saturates to $\\approx 4-5$ which indicates that\nthe underlying dynamical mechanism is a low dimensional chaotic system. Of the\nother eight classes, three show stochastic behavior while five show deviation\nfrom randomness. The light curves for four classes which depict chaotic\nbehavior have the smallest ratio of the expected Poisson noise to the\nvariability ($ < 0.05$) while those for the three classes which depict\nstochastic behavior is the highest ($ > 0.2$).

Our CO velocity data show that the visible nucleus in M83 is at\nleast 3\" (65 pc) away from the galaxy's dynamical center, which most likely\ncoincides with the center of symmetry previously determined in K band and is\nsuggested to host another nucleus. We discovered high-velocity molecular gas\nassociated with the visible off-center nucleus, and also found a steep velocity\ngradient across it. We attribute these features to a gas disk rotating around\nthe off-center nucleus, which may be the remnant of a small galaxy accreted by\nM83. The dynamical mass of this component is estimated to be 3x10^8 Msun within\na radius of 40 pc. The dynamical perturbation from the off-center nucleus may\nhave played a key role in shaping the lopsided starburst.",

Since all the old\naccreted stars of our sample exhibit a significant Eu overabundance relative to\nMg, we conclude that the maximum masses of the SNII progenitors outside the\nGalaxy were much lower than those inside it are. On the other hand, only a\nsmall number of young accreted stars exhibit low negative ratios $[Eu/Mg] < 0$.\nThe delay of primordial star formation burst and the explosions of high mass\nSNe II in a relatively small part of extragalactic space can explain this\nsituation.

    "summary": "A quantum digital signature protocol based on quantum mechanics is proposed\nin this paper. The security of the protocol relies on the existence of quantum\none-way functions by quantum information theorem. This protocol involves a\nso-called arbitrator who validates and authenticates the signed message. In\nthis protocol, we use privacy key algorithm to ensure the security of quantum\ninformation on channel and use quantum public keys to sign message. To\nguarantee the authenticity of the message, a family of quantum stabilizer codes\nare employed. Our protocol presents a novel method to construct ultimately\nsecure digital system in future secure communication.",

We found that X-ray absorption in\naddition to the Galactic one along the line of sight is highly statistically\nsignificant in the two cases with the best statistics (probability >99.9%). In\nthree other cases the presence of X-ray absorption is marginally significant\n(probability 97%). Measured rest frame equivalent hydrogen column densities NH\nrange from 0.1 to 10.0 x 10^22 cm-2 (at 90% confidence level) assuming a solar\nmetal abundance. X-ray absorption may be common, although the quality of\npresent data does not allow us to reach a firm conclusion. The rest frame NH\nderived from XMM and Chandra data as quoted in the literature are in good\nagreement with the BeppoSAX estimates. For the same GRB afterglow sample we\nevaluated the rest frame visual extinction AVr. We fitted the optical-NIR\nafterglow photometry with a power law model corrected by four different\nextinction curves. By comparing X-ray absorptions and optical extinction, we\nfound that if a Galactic-like dust grain size distribution is assumed, a dust\nto gas ratio lower than the one observed in the Galaxy is required by the data.\nA dust to gas ratio 1/10 than the Galactic one, has been tested using the Small\nMagellanic Cloud extinction curve, which produces inconsistent results.\nAlternative scenarios to explain simultaneously the optical and X-ray data\ninvolve dust with grain size distributions biased toward large grains. Possible\nmechanisms that can bring to such a grain size distribution are discussed.",

    "summary": "Maps of Galactic polarized continuum emission at 1408, 1660, and 1713 MHz\ntowards the local Taurus molecular cloud complex were made with the Effelsberg\n100-m telescope. Minima in the polarized emission which are located at the\nboundary of a molecular cloud were detected. Beside high rotation measures and\nunusual spectral indices of the polarized intensity, these features are\nassociated with the molecular gas. At the higher frequencies the minima get\nless distinct. We have modelled the multi-frequency observations by placing\nmagneto-ionic Faraday screens at the distance of the molecular cloud. In this\nmodel Faraday rotated background emission adds to foreground emission towards\nthese screens. The systematic variation of the observed properties is the\nresult of different line-of-sight lengths through the screen assuming spherical\nsymmetry. For a distance of 140 pc to the Taurus clouds the physical sizes of\nthe Faraday screens are of the order of 2 pc. In this paper we describe the\ndata calibration and modelling process for one such object. We find an\nintrinsic rotation measure of about -29 rad/m^{2} to model the observations. It\nis pointed out that the observed rotation measure differs from the physical.\nFurther observational constraints from H-alpha observations limit the thermal\nelectron density to less than 0.8 cm^{-3}, and we conclude that the regular\nmagnetic field strength parallel to the line-of-sight exceeds 20 micro Gauss to\naccount for the intrinsic rotation measure.",

We show that the energy-momentum\ntensor in the noncommutative complex scalar field theory is defined up to six\narbitrary constants.

    "summary": "It has recently been suggested that the quark-gluon plasma formed in\nheavy-ion collisions behaves as a nearly ideal fluid. That behavior may be\nunderstood if the quark and antiquark mean-free- paths are very small in the\nsystem, leading to a \"sticky molasses\" description of the plasma, as advocated\nby the Stony Brook group. This behavior may be traced to the fact that there\nare relatively low-energy $q\\bar{q}$ resonance states in the plasma leading to\nvery large scattering lengths for the quarks. These resonances have been found\nin lattice simulation of QCD using the maximum entropy method (MEM). We have\nused a chiral quark model, which provides a simple representation of effects\ndue to instanton dynamics, to study the resonances obtained using the MEM\nscheme. In the present work we use our model to study the optical potential of\na quark in the quark-gluon plasma and calculate the quark mean-free-path. Our\nresults represent a specific example of the dynamics of the plasma as described\nby the Stony Brook group.",

    "summary": "We have undertaken a thorough dynamical investigation of five extrasolar\nplanetary systems using extensive numerical experiments. The systems Gl 777 A,\nHD 72659, Gl 614, 47 Uma and HD 4208 were examined concerning the question of\nwhether they could host terrestrial like planets in their habitable zones\n(=HZ). First we investigated the mean motion resonances between fictitious\nterrestrial planets and the existing gas giants in these five extrasolar\nsystems. Then a fine grid of initial conditions for a potential terrestrial\nplanet within the HZ was chosen for each system, from which the stability of\norbits was then assessed by direct integrations over a time interval of 1\nmillion years. The computations were carried out using a Lie-series integration\nmethod with an adaptive step size control. This integration method achieves\nmachine precision accuracy in a highly efficient and robust way, requiring no\nspecial adjustments when the orbits have large eccentricities. The stability of\norbits was examined with a determination of the Renyi entropy, estimated from\nrecurrence plots, and with a more straight forward method based on the maximum\neccentricity achieved by the planet over the 1 million year integration.\nAdditionally, the eccentricity is an indication of the habitability of a\nterrestrial planet in the HZ; any value of e>0.2 produces a significant\ntemperature difference on a planet's surface between apoapse and periapse. The\nresults for possible stable orbits for terrestrial planets in habitable zones\nfor the five systems are summarized as follows: for Gl 777 A nearly the entire\nHZ is stable, for 47 Uma, HD 72659 and HD 4208 terrestrial planets can survive\nfor a sufficiently long time, while for Gl 614 our results exclude terrestrial\nplanets moving in stable orbits within the HZ.",

Conspicuous evidence for\nvariability in H\\alpha is found for the stars displaying a feature contaminated\nby wind emission. Most changes take place on a daily time-scale, although\nhourly variations are also occasionally detected. Convincing evidence for a\ncyclical pattern of variability in H\\alpha has been found in 2 stars: HD 14134\nand HD 42087 (periodic signals are also detected in other stars, but\nindependent confirmation is required). Rotational modulation is suggested from\nthe similarity between the observed recurrence time-scales (in the range 13-25\ndays) and estimated periods of stellar rotation. We call attention to the\natypical case of HD 14134 which exhibits a clear 12.8-d periodicity both in the\nphotometric and in the spectroscopic data sets. This places this object among a\nhandful of early-type stars where one may observe a clear link between extended\nwind structures and photospheric disturbances.

With the H- and K-band\nspectra now obtained with ISAAC at the VLT, the spectral type of the companion\ncandidate is found to be M6-9.5. Assuming the same age and distance as for the\nprimary star (~35 Myrs, 50 to 85 pc), this yields a mass of ~25 Jupiter masses\nfor the companion, hence indeed substellar. After TWA-5 B and HR 7329 B, this\nis the third brown dwarf companion around a nearby (up to 100 pc) young (up to\n100 Myrs) star. A total of three confirmed brown dwarf companions (any mass,\nseparation above 50 AU) around 79 stars surveyed in three young nearby\nassociations corresponds to a frequency of 6 \\pm 4 % (with a correction for\nmissing companions which are almost on the same line-of-sight as the primary\nstar instead of being separated well), consistent with the expectation, if\nbinaries have the same mass function as field stars.

We\nconcentrate on the usual tachyon and show the phantom symmetry involves a\nchange in the potential and that it generates an extended super-accelerated\ntachyon field.

    "summary": "We present the HI data for 5 spiral galaxies that, along with their Halpha\nrotation curves, are used to derive the distribution of dark matter within\nthese objects. A new method for extracting rotation curves from HI data cubes\nis presented; this takes into account the existence of a warp and minimises\nprojection effects. The rotation curves obtained are tested by taking them as\ninput to construct model data cubes that are compared to the observed ones: the\nagreement is excellent. On the contrary, the model data cubes built using\nrotation curves obtained with standard methods, such as the first-moment\nanalysis, fail the test. The HI rotation curves agree well with the Halpha\ndata, where they coexist. Moreover, the combined Halpha + HI rotation curves\nare smooth, symmetric and extended to large radii.\n  The rotation curves are decomposed into stellar, gaseous and dark matter\ncontributions and the inferred density distribution is compared to various mass\ndistributions: dark haloes with a central density core, $\\Lambda$ Cold Dark\nMatter ($\\Lambda$CDM) haloes (NFW, Moore profiles), HI scaling and MOND. The\nobservations point to haloes with constant density cores of size $r_{core} \\sim\nr_{opt}$ and central densities scaling approximately as $\\rho_0 \\propto\nr_{core}^{-2/3}$. $\\Lambda$CDM models (which predict a central cusp in the\ndensity profile) are in clear conflict with the data. HI scaling and MOND\ncannot account for the observed kinematics: we find some counter-examples.",

    "summary": "Quasar accretion disks are believed to form stars by self-gravity. Low\nLuminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (LLAGN) are much dimmer galactic centers, and\nare often believed to be quasars that ran out of gaseous fuel. LLAGN accretion\ndisks should thus co-exist with thousands to millions of stars or proto-stars\nleft from the previous stronger accretion activity. In principle, these stars\nmay produce several important effects: (i) contribute to the optical/UV spectra\nof some LLAGN; (ii) reprocessing of the stellar radiation in the dusty disks\ncould dominate the LLAGN infra-red spectra; (iii) deplete the (accretion) gas\ndisk much faster than it can accrete onto the supper-massive black hole (SMBH);\n(iv) stars, individually or in groups, may slow down and modulate the accretion\nflow significantly due to their inertia. In this way they may produce the LLAGN\ncut-off disks; (v) alternatively, frequent enough stellar collisions and\nresulting stellar disruptions could keep the inner disk empty. Here we explore\nthese ideas. We find that, despite ``low'' luminosities of LLAGN,\nunrealistically high stellar densities are required to make a sizable radiative\ncontribution to the (HST) optical/UV spectra of these galactic nuclei. Stellar\ncontribution to the infrared spectrum is more likely. Further, if LLAGN are in\na quasi steady-state for as long as 10^7 years or more, too high stellar\ndensities would again be required to significantly affect the dynamics of\naccretion flow. However, if LLAGN are ``short''-lived phenomena, e.g. t < 10^5\nyears, quiescent states of quiescence-outburst cycles, then embedded stars may\nbe much more important through the mass effects (iii) -- (v). With observations\nof LLAGN becoming progressively better, it will be more and more difficult to\nneglect the presence of close stars in and around nuclear accretion disks.",

Our\ngoal is to elucidate the origins of X-rays in PMS stars by seeking out\nconnections between the X-rays and the mechanisms most likely driving their\nproduction--rotation and accretion. In our sample X-ray luminosity is\nsignificantly correlated with stellar rotation, in the sense of decreasing\nLx/Lbol with more rapid rotation, suggesting that these stars are in the\n\"super-saturated\" regime of the rotation-activity relationship. However, we\nalso find that stars with optical rotation periods are significantly biased to\nhigh Lx. This is not the result of magnitude bias in the optical\nrotation-period sample but rather to the diminishingly small amplitude of\noptical variations in stars with low Lx. Evidently, there exists in the ONC a\npopulation of stars whose rotation periods are unknown and that possess lower\naverage X-ray luminosities than those of stars with known rotation periods.\nThese stars may sample the linear regime of the rotation-activity relationship.\nAccretion also manifests itself in X-rays, though in a somewhat\ncounterintuitive fashion: While stars with spectroscopic signatures of\naccretion show harder X-ray spectra than non-accretors, they show lower X-ray\nluminosities and no enhancement of X-ray variability. We interpret these\nfindings in terms of a common origin for the X-ray emission observed from both\naccreting and non-accreting stars, with the X-rays from accreting stars simply\nbeing attenuated by magnetospheric accretion columns. This suggests that X-rays\nfrom PMS stars have their origins primarily in chromospheres, not accretion.",

This set-up allowed determining three observables whose\nsensitivity to dissipation was investigated for the first time: the total\nfission cross sections of 238U at 1 A GeV as a function of the target mass,\nand, for the reaction of 238U at 1 A GeV on a (CH2)n target, the partial\nfission cross sections and the partial charge distributions of the fission\nfragments. The comparison of the new experimental data with a reaction code\nadapted to the conditions of the reactions investigated leads to clear\nconclusions on the strength of dissipation at small deformation where the\nexisting results are rather contradictory.",

An analytic calculation of the\nquark condensate in one-flavor QCD starting from the gluino condensate in N=1\ngluodynamics is thoroughly discussed. We also comment on a planar equivalence\ninvolving N=2 supersymmetry, on \"chiral rings\" in non-supersymmetric theories,\nand on the origin of planar equivalence from an underlying, non-tachyonic\ntype-0 string theory. Finally, possible further directions of investigation,\nsuch as the gauge/gravity correspondence in large-N orientifold field theory,\nare briefly discussed.",

It is shown that\nin a physical relevant range of densities the pairing properties of inner crust\nmatter depend significantly on temperature.

We derive a GC color--galaxy luminosity relation of the form Z ~ L^\n(0.15 +/- 0.03). When combined with evidence against a single primordial GC\nmetallicity--galaxy luminosity relation for protogalactic fragments, the\nexistence of such a correlation is evidence against both accretion and major\nmerger scenarios as an explanation of the entire metal-poor GC systems of\nluminous galaxies. However, our relation arises naturally in an in situ picture\nof GC formation, and is consistent with the truncation of metal-poor GC\nformation by reionization. A further implication is that the ages of metal-poor\nGCs in dwarf galaxies constrain the main epoch of galaxy formation in\nhierarchical models. If the ages of old metal-poor GCs in Local Group dwarfs (>\n11 Gyr) are typical of those in dwarfs elsewhere, then the bulk of galaxy\nassembly (at least in clusters and groups) must have occurred at z > 2.5,\ncontrary to the predictions of some structure formation models.",

    "summary": "This review discusses a paradigm that has become of increasing importance in\nthe theory of quantum phase transitions; namely, the coupling of the\norder-parameter fluctuations to other soft modes, and the resulting\nimpossibility of constructing a simple Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson theory in terms\nof the order parameter only. The soft modes in question are manifestations of\ngeneric scale invariance, i.e., the appearance of long-range order in whole\nregions in the phase diagram. The concept of generic scale invariance, and its\ninfluence on critical behavior, is explained using various examples, both\nclassical and quantum mechanical. The peculiarities of quantum phase\ntransitions are discussed, with emphasis on the fact that they are more\nsusceptible to the effects of generic scale invariance than their classical\ncounterparts. Explicit examples include: the quantum ferromagnetic transition\nin metals, with or without quenched disorder; the metal-superconductor\ntransition at zero temperature; and the quantum antiferromagnetic transition.\nAnalogies with classical phase transitions in liquid crystals and classical\nfluids are pointed out, and a unifying conceptual framework is developed for\nall transitions that are influenced by generic scale invariance.",

The 2-150 keV time-integrated energy spectrum is well\ndescribed by the sum of two blackbodies whose temperatures are approximately\n4.3 and 9.8 keV. The time-resolved energy spectra are similarly well fit by the\nsum of two blackbodies. The higher temperature blackbody evolves with time in a\nmanner consistent with a shrinking emitting surface. The interpretation of\nthese results in the context of the magnetar model suggests that the two\nblackbody fit is an approximation of an absorbed, multi-temperature spectrum\nexpected on theoretical grounds rather than a physical description of the\nemission. If this is indeed the case, our data provide further evidence for a\nstrong magnetic field, and indicate that the entire neutron was radiating\nduring most of the burst duration.",

The MD results not only show the\nexistence of fluid slip but also verify the validity of the Navier slip\nboundary condition. To better understand the fluid slip in this problem, a\ncontinuum hydrodynamic model has been formulated based upon the MD verification\nof the Navier boundary condition and the Newtonian stress. Our model has no\nadjustable parameter because all the material parameters (density, viscosity,\nand slip length) are directly determined from MD simulations. Steady-state\nvelocity fields from continuum calculations are in quantitative agreement with\nthose from MD simulations, from the molecular-scale structure to the global\nflow. The main discovery is as follows. In the immediate vicinity of the\ncorners where moving and fixed solid surfaces intersect, there is a core\npartial-slip region where the slippage is large at the moving solid surface and\ndecays away from the intersection quickly. In particular, the structure of this\ncore region is nearly independent of the system size. On the other hand, for\nsufficiently large system, an additional partial-slip region appears where the\nslippage varies as $1/r$ with $r$ denoting the distance from the corner along\nthe moving solid surface. The existence of this wide power-law region is in\naccordance with the asymptotic $1/r$ variation of stress and the Navier\nboundary condition.",

In our experiments, microreboots reduced the number of\nfailed user requests by 65% and the perceived downtime by 78% compared to a\nserver process restart.

However, each of the two single dots is\ncharacterized by a few energy levels only, and the wire is assumed to have only\none level whose energy depends on L. The transmission is described by using\nS-matrix theory. The model explains in particular the splitting of the resonant\ntransmission peaks and the origin of the transmission zeros. The latter are\nindependent of the length of the wire. When the transmission zeros of the\nsingle dots are of first order and both single dots are identical, those of the\ndouble dot are of second order. First-order transmission zeros cause phase\njumps of the transmission amplitude by $\\pi$, while there are no phase jumps\nrelated to second-order transmission zeros. In this latter case, a phase jump\nappears due to a resonance state whose decay width vanishes when crossing the\nenergy of the transmission zero.",

The initial stellar models are modelled as relativistic\npolytropes which are either secularly or dynamically unstable and with angular\nvelocities which range from slow rotation to the mass-shedding limit. We\ninvestigate the gravitational collapse by carefully studying not only the\ndynamics of the matter, but also that of the trapped surfaces, i.e. of both the\napparent and event horizons formed during the collapse. The use of these\nsurfaces, together with the dynamical horizon framework, allows for a precise\nmeasurement of the black-hole mass and spin. The ability to successfully\nperform these simulations for sufficiently long times relies on excising a\nregion of the computational domain which includes the singularity and is within\nthe apparent horizon. The dynamics of the collapsing matter is strongly\ninfluenced by the initial amount of angular momentum in the progenitor star\nand, for initial models with sufficiently high angular velocities, the collapse\ncan lead to the formation of an unstable disc in differential rotation. All the\nsimulations performed with uniformly rotating initial data and a polytropic or\nideal-fluid equation of state show no evidence of shocks or of the presence of\nmatter on stable orbits outside the black hole.",

Our proofs are based on fine estimates in terms of\ncontrol functions and are sufficiently general to include the case of Hoelder-\nand modulus-type regularity, Friz/Victoir (03).

With\nsimulations on Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\\delta}$ (Bi2212), we show that the\nARPES matrix element possesses remarkable selectivity properties, such that by\ntuning the photon energy and polarization, emission from the bonding or the\nantibonding states can be enhanced. Moreover, at low photon energies (below 25\neV), the Fermi surface (FS) emission is dominated by transitions from just the\nO-atoms in the CuO$_2$ planes. In connection with strong correlation effects,\nwe consider the evolution with doping of the FS of\nNd$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_{4\\pm\\delta}$ (NCCO) in terms of the $t$-$t'$-$U$ Hubbard\nmodel Hamiltonian. We thus delineate how the FS evolves on electron doping from\nthe insulating state in NCCO.

Using an i-z>1.4 cut, we find 30 i-dropouts over 21 arcmin^2 down\nto z_AB=28.1, or 1.4 i-dropouts arcmin^{-2}, with significant field-to-field\nvariation (as expected from cosmic variance). This extends i-dropout searches\nsome ~0.9^m further down the luminosity function than was possible in the GOODS\nfield, netting a ~7x increase in surface density. An estimate of the size\nevolution for UV bright objects is obtained by comparing the composite radial\nflux profile of the bright i-dropouts (z<27.2) with scaled versions of the\nHDF-N + HDF-S U-dropouts. The best-fit is found with a (1+z)^{-1.57_{-0.53}\n^{+0.50}} scaling in size (for fixed luminosity), extending lower redshift\n(1<z<5) trends to z~6. Adopting this scaling and the brighter i-dropouts from\nboth GOODS fields, we make incompleteness estimates and construct a z~6 LF in\nthe rest-frame continuum UV (~1350 A) over a 3.5 magnitude baseline, finding a\nshape consistent with that found at lower redshift. To evaluate the evolution\nin the LF from z~3.8, we make comparisons against different scalings of a lower\nredshift B-dropout sample. Though a strong degeneracy is found between\nluminosity and density evolution, our best-fit model scales as (1+z)^{-2.8} in\nnumber and (1+z)^0.1 in luminosity, suggesting a rest-frame continuum UV\nluminosity density at z~6 which is just 0.38_{-0.07} ^{+0.09}x that at z~3.8.\nOur inclusion of size evolution makes the present estimate lower than previous\nz~6 estimates.",

Analogously\n`boundary' symmetries arise when general but still integrable boundary\nconditions are implemented, as originally argued by Delius, Mackay and Short\nfrom the field theory point of view, in the context of the principal chiral\nmodel on the half line. In the present study we deal with a discrete quantum\nmechanical system with boundaries, that is the $N$ site $gl(n)$ open quantum\nspin chain. In particular, the open spin chain with two distinct types of\nboundary conditions known as soliton preserving and soliton non-preserving is\nconsidered. For both types of boundaries we present a unified framework for\nderiving the corresponding boundary non-local charges directly at the quantum\nlevel. The non-local charges are simply coproduct realizations of particular\nboundary quantum algebras called `boundary' or twisted Yangians, depending on\nthe choice of boundary conditions. Finally, with the help of linear\nintertwining relations between the solutions of the reflection equation and the\ngenerators of the boundary or twisted Yangians we are able to exhibit the\nsymmetry of the open spin chain, namely we show that a number of the boundary\nnon-local charges are in fact conserved quantities",

It is\nshown that in the majority of Galaxy volume, accretion onto single stellar-mass\nblack holes will be spherical and have a low accretion rate ($10^{-6} -\n10^{-9}$ of the Eddington rate). An analysis of plasma internal energy growth\nduring the infall is performed. Adiabatic heating of collisionless accretion\nflow due to magnetic adiabatic invariant conservation is 25% more efficient\nthan in the standard non-magnetized gas case. It is shown that magnetic field\nline reconnections in discrete current sheets lead to significant nonthermal\nelectron component formation. In a framework of quasi-diffusion acceleration,\nthe \"energy-radius\" electron distribution is computed and the function\ndescribing the shape of synchrotron radiation spectrum is constructed. It is\nshown that nonthermal electron emission leads to formation of a hard (UV,\nX-ray, up to gamma), highly variable spectral component in addition to the\nstandard synchrotron optical component first derived by Shvartsman generated by\nthermal electrons in the magnetic field of accretion flow. For typical\ninterstellar medium parameters, a black hole at 100 pc distance will be a\n16-25$^{\\rm m}$ optical source coinciding with the highly variable bright X-ray\ncounterpart, while the variable component of optical emission will be about\n18-27$^{\\rm m}$. The typical time scale of the variability is $10^{-4}$ sec,\nwith relative flare amplitudes of 0.2-6% in various spectral bands.

The analysis is based on an EVN (European VLBI\nNetwork) dataset at 5 GHz and archive VLBA (Very Long Baseline Array) datasets\nat 2.3, 8.3, 24.4 and 43.1 GHz over a period of 8 years. The source is\ncharacterized by a multi--component one--sided jet at all epochs. The\nhigh--resolution images at 5, 8.3, 24.4 and 43.1 GHz show a curved jet\nmorphology in the source. The radio core brightness temperature approaches the\nequipartition limit. Superluminal motions of $37.3\\pm9.3 c$, $22.0\\pm15.5 c$,\n$10.5\\pm2.6 c$ and $27.9\\pm7.0 c$ are measured in four distinct components of\nthe jet. Our analysis supports the idea that the relativistic jet in\n\\object{PKS 1502+106} is characterised by extreme beaming and that its radio\nproperties are similar to those of $\\gamma$--ray loud sources.",

Quantum logic was proposed by Birkhoff and von Neumann as a\nlogic of quantum mechanics more than sixty years ago. The major difference\nbetween Boolean logic and quantum logic is that the latter does not enjoy\ndistributivity in general. The rapid development of quantum computation in\nrecent years stimulates us to establish a theory of computation based on\nquantum logic. The present paper is the first step toward such a new theory and\nit focuses on the simplest models of computation, namely finite automata. It is\nfound that the universal validity of many properties of automata depend heavily\nupon the distributivity of the underlying logic. This indicates that these\nproperties does not universally hold in the realm of quantum logic. On the\nother hand, we show that a local validity of them can be recovered by imposing\na certain commutativity to the (atomic) statements about the automata under\nconsideration. This reveals an essential difference between the classical\ntheory of computation and the computation theory based on quantum logic.",

The structure function of RM fluctuations shows a relatively\nsteep slope at small scales (1-5 arcmin), a break in slope to a flatter\nstructure function at intermediate scales (5-60 arcmin), and a systematic\nvariation of the strength of fluctuations as a function of position angle on\nthe sky at the largest scales (60-200 arcmin). The structure function of EM\nfluctuations shows similar behavior, although the lower resolution of the data\nprevents detection of a possible break in the spectrum. We interpret the\nanisotropy in RM/EM structure on large scales as resulting from a large-scale\ngradient in electron density (and possibly magnetic field) across the region.\nThe break in the slope of the RM structure function at scales of about 5 arcmin\ncan be explained by contributions from two spatially distinct magneto-ionized\nscreens, most likely in the Local and Carina spiral arms. The observed\nstructure function then implies that the outer scale of RM fluctuations in\nthese screens is about 2 pc. We conclude that we have identified an additional\nsource of enhanced turbulence, injected on scales of a few pc, possibly seen\nonly in the Galactic plane. The most likely source of such turbulence is\nindividual HII regions from relatively low-mass stars, whose characteristic\nscale size is similar to the outer scale of turbulence inferred here. These\nsources may be the dominant source of density and velocity fluctuations in warm\nionized gas in the Galactic plane.",

    "summary": "Models of contagion arise broadly both in the biological and social sciences,\nwith applications ranging from the transmission of infectious diseases to the\ndiffusion of innovations and the spread of cultural fads. In this Letter, we\nintroduce a general model of contagion which, by explicitly incorporating\nmemory of past exposures to, for example, an infectious agent, rumor, or new\nproduct, includes the main features of existing contagion models and\ninterpolates between them. We obtain exact solutions for a simple version of\nthe model, finding that under general conditions only three classes of\ncollective dynamics exist, two of which correspond to familiar epidemic\nthreshold and critical mass dynamics, while the third is a distinct\nintermediate case. We find that for a given length of memory, the class into\nwhich a particular system falls is determined by two parameters, each of which\nought to be measurable empirically. Our model suggests novel measures for\nassessing the susceptibility of a population to large contagion events, and\nalso a possible strategy for inhibiting or facilitating them.",

The minimal cooling\nscenario replaces and extends the so-called standard cooling scenario to\ninclude neutrino emission from the Cooper pair breaking and formation process.\nThis emission dominates that due to the modified Urca process for temperatures\nclose to the critical temperature for superfluid pairing. Minimal cooling is\ndistinguished from enhanced cooling by the absence of neutrino emission from\nany direct Urca process, due either to nucleons or to exotica. Within the\nminimal cooling scenario, theoretical cooling models can be considered to be a\nfour parameter family involving the equation of state of dense matter,\nsuperfluid properties of dense matter, the composition of the neutron star\nenvelope, and the mass of the neutron star. Consequences of minimal cooling are\nexplored through extensive variations of these parameters. Results are compared\nwith the inferred properties of thermally-emitting neutron stars in order to\nascertain if enhanced cooling occurs in any of them. All stars for which\nthermal emissions have been clearly detected are at least marginally consistent\nwith the lack of enhanced cooling. The two pulsars PSR 0833-45 (Vela) and PSR\n1706-44 would require enhanced cooling in case their ages and/or temperatures\nare on the lower side of their estimated values whereas the four stars PSR\n0656+14, PSR 1055-52, Geminga, and RX J0720.4-3125 may require some source of\ninternal heating in case their age and/or luminosity are on the upper side of\ntheir estimated values. The new upper limits on the thermal luminosity of PSR\nJ0205+6449 and RX J0007.0+7302 are indicative of the occurrence of some\nenhanced neutrino emission beyond the minimal scenario.",

    "summary": "We analyze the statistical properties and dynamical implications of galaxy\ndistributions in phase space for samples selected from the 2MASS Extended\nSource Catalog. The galaxy distribution is decomposed into modes $\\delta({\\bf\nk, x})$ which describe the number density perturbations of galaxies in phase\nspace cell given by scale band $\\bf k$ to ${\\bf k}+\\Delta {\\bf k}$ and spatial\nrange $\\bf x$ to ${\\bf x}+\\Delta {\\bf x}$. In the nonlinear regime,\n$\\delta({\\bf k, x})$ is highly non-Gaussian. We find, however, that the\ncorrelations between $\\delta({\\bf k, x})$ and $\\delta({\\bf k', x'})$ are always\nvery weak if the spatial ranges (${\\bf x}$, ${\\bf x}+\\Delta {\\bf x}$) and\n(${\\bf x'}$, ${\\bf x'}+\\Delta {\\bf x'}$) don't overlap. This feature is due to\nthe fact that the spatial locality of the initial perturbations is memorized\nduring hierarchical clustering. The highly spatial locality of the 2MASS galaxy\ncorrelations is a strong evidence for the initial perturbations of the cosmic\nmass field being spatially localized, and therefore, consistent with a Gaussian\ninitial perturbations on scales as small as about 0.1 h$^{-1}$ Mpc. Moreover,\nthe 2MASS galaxy spatial locality indicates that the relationship between\ndensity perturbations of galaxies and the underlying dark matter should be\nlocalized in phase space. That is, for a structure consisting of perturbations\non scales from $k$ to $ k+\\Delta {k}$, the nonlocal range in the relation\nbetween galaxies and dark matter should {\\it not} be larger than $|{\\Delta {\\bf\nx}}|=2\\pi/|\\Delta {\\bf k}|$.

We are able to accurately fit the entire profiles using either the\nSersic function or our new model. In doing so, we demonstrate that most, if not\nall, so-called ``power-law'' galaxies are better described as ``Sersic\ngalaxies'' -- they are well modeled by the three-parameter Sersic profile into\nthe limits of HST resolution -- and that ``core'' galaxies are best understood\nas consisting of an outer Sersic profile with an inner power-law cusp, which is\na downward deviation from the inward extrapolation of the Sersic profile. This\ndefinition of cores resolves ambiguities that result when the popular ``Nuker\nlaw'' is fitted to the profiles of ellipticals and bulges, particularly at\nlower luminosities.

In this way the Sagnac effect can be explained as being\npurely topological, neglecting the radial acceleration altogether. This proves\nthat the rim of the disk can be treated as an inertial system. In the same\ncontext we discuss the twin paradox and find that the standard scenario is\nequivalent to an unaccelerated version in a closed space-time.

    "summary": "Several lines of evidence suggest that protogalactic and galactic\nenvironments manage to grow magnetic field very rapidly. This makes the\ntheoretical problem of achieving rapid growth of magnetic fields in such\nenvironments difficult. Following Balsara, Benjamin and Cox (2001), we show\nthat a multiphase ISM that is dominated by realistic energy inputs via\nsupernova explosions will naturally become a strongly turbulent medium with\nlarge positive and negative values of the fluid helicity. The resultant\ninterstellar turbulence seems to have some of the essential characteristics of\na fast dynamo. Magnetic field growth in such a turbulent dynamo is studied in\nthis paper. It is shown that the field undergoes a linear phase of evolution\nwhere it has a time of growth that is comparable to the eddy turn-over time.\nEnergetics, power spectra, statistics and structures of the turbulent dynamo\nare studied here. It is shown that despite the fact that the ISM is driven by\ncompressive motions, the kinetic energy in this high Mach number flow is mainly\nconcentrated in solenoidal motions rather than compressive motions.",

After introducing a gauge-invariant formalism for the generic\nmetric perturbations of these backgrounds, we focus on modes which are scalar\nwith respect to dS_4. The physical eigenmasses of these modes acquire a large\nuniversal tachyonic contribution -12d/(d+2) H^2, independently of the\nstabilization mechanism for the compact space, in addition to the usual KK\nmasses, which instead encode the effects of the stabilization. General\narguments, as well as specific examples, lead us to conjecture that, for\nsufficiently large dS curvature, the compactified geometry becomes\ngravitationally unstable due to the tachyonic growth of the scalar\nperturbations. This mean that for any stabilization mechanism the curvature of\nthe dS geometry cannot exceed some critical value. We relate this effect to the\nanisotropy of the bulk geometry and suggest the end points of the instability.\nOf relevance for inflationary cosmology, the perturbations of the bulk metric\ninevitably induce a new modulus field, which describes the conformal\nfluctuations of the 4 dimensional metric. If this mode is light during\ninflation, the induced conformal fluctuations will be amplified with a scale\nfree spectrum and with an amplitude which is disentangled from the standard\nresult of slow-roll inflation.

The full\nthree-dimensional transport problem is described in terms of coupled transverse\nsubband modes which arise due to quantum confinement along the body thickness\ndirection. Couplings among the subbands are generated for two reasons: due to\nspatial variations of the confinement potential along the transport direction,\nand due to non-alignment of the device coordinate system with the principal\naxes of the constant energy conduction band ellipsoids. The problem simplifies\nconsiderably if the electrostatic potential is separable along transport and\nconfinement directions, and further if the potential variations along the\ntransport direction are slow enough to prevent dipolar coupling (Zener\ntunneling) between subbands. In this limit, the transport problem can be solved\nby employing two unitary operators to transform an arbitrarily oriented\nconstant energy ellipsoid into a regular ellipsoid with principal axes along\nthe transport, width and confinement directions of the device.

These probabilities, on the other hand, may be determined by\nthe limit of relative frequency of measured events, which are by nature\nadditive. We demonstrate that there are only two ways to resolve this problem.\nThe first solution places emphasis on the precise use of the concept of\nconditional probability for successive measurements. The physically correct\nconditional probabilities define additive probabilities for two-time\nmeasurements. These probabilities depend explicitly on the resolution of the\nphysical device and do not, therefore, correspond to a function of the\nassociated projection operators. It follows that quantum theory distinguishes\nbetween physical events and propositions about events, the latter are not\nrepresented by projection operators and that the outcomes of two-time\nexperiments cannot be described by quantum logic.\n  The alternative explanation is rather radical: it is conceivable that the\nrelative frequencies for two-time measurements do not converge, unless a\nparticular consistency condition is satisfied. If this is true, a strong\nrevision of the quantum mechanical formalism may prove necessary. We stress\nthat it is possible to perform experiments that will distinguish the two\nalternatives.",

The main tool is simple: just eliminate from algebraic\nequations, via resultants. By combining Gauss and Robbins formulas we get an\nexplicit rational expression for the area of any cyclic pentagon. So, after\ncenturies of geometry of triangles and quadrilaterals, we arrive to the\nnontrivial geometry of pentagons.",

    "published": "2004-03-29T21:38:31+00:00",
    "summary": "The problem of how mathematics and physics are related at a foundational\nlevel is of much interest. One approach is to work towards a coherent theory of\nphysics and mathematics together. Here steps are taken in this direction by\nfirst examining the theory experiment connection. The role of an implied theory\nhierarchy and use of computers in comparing theory and experiment is described.\nThe main idea of the paper is to tighten the theory experiment connection by\nbringing physical theories, as mathematical structures over C, the complex\nnumbers, closer to what is actually done in experimental measurements and\ncomputations. The method replaces C by C_{n} which is the set of pairs,\nR_{n},I_{n}, of n figure rational numbers in some basis. The properties of\nthese numbers are based on the type of numbers that represent measurement\noutcomes for continuous variables. A model of space and time based on R_{n} is\ndiscussed. The model is scale invariant with regions of constant step size\ninterrupted by exponential jumps. A method of taking the limit n to infinity to\nobtain locally flat continuum based space and time is outlined. Possibly the\nmost interesting result is that R_{n} based space is invariant under scale\ntransformations which correspond to expansion and contraction of space relative\nto a flat background. Also the location of the origin, which is a space and\ntime singularity, does not change under these transformations. Some properties\nof quantum mechanics based on C_{n} and on R_{n} space are briefly\ninvestigated.",

    "summary": "In a celebrated paper, Dyson shows that the spectrum of an n\\times n random\nHermitian matrix, diffusing according to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, evolves\nas n noncolliding Brownian motions held together by a drift term. The universal\nedge and bulk scalings for Hermitian random matrices, applied to the Dyson\nprocess, lead to the Airy and Sine processes. In particular, the Airy process\nis a continuous stationary process, describing the motion of the outermost\nparticle of the Dyson Brownian motion, when the number of particles gets large,\nwith space and time appropriately rescaled. In this paper, we answer a question\nposed by Kurt Johansson, to find a PDE for the joint distribution of the Airy\nprocess at two different times. Similarly we find a PDE satisfied by the joint\ndistribution of the Sine process. This hinges on finding a PDE for the joint\ndistribution of the Dyson process, which itself is based on the joint\nprobability of the eigenvalues for coupled Gaussian Hermitian matrices. The PDE\nfor the Dyson process is then subjected to an asymptotic analysis, consistent\nwith the edge and bulk rescalings. The PDEs enable one to compute the\nasymptotic behavior of the joint distribution and the correlation for these\nprocesses at different times t_1 and t_2, when t_2-t_1\\to \\infty, as\nillustrated in this paper for the Airy process. This paper also contains a\nrigorous proof that the extended Hermite kernel, governing the joint\nprobabilities for the Dyson process, converges to the extended Airy and Sine\nkernels after the appropriate rescalings.",

We show that previous results\nobtained for infinite ensemble of identically prepared systems lead to\nincorrect conclusions for finite ensembles. In particular, exact measurement of\na macroscopic observable significantly disturbs the state of any finite\nensemble. However, we show how this disturbance can be made arbitrarily small\nwhen the measurement are of finite accuracy. We demonstrate a tradeoff between\nstate disturbance and measurement coarseness as a function of the size of the\nensemble. Using this tradeoff, we show that the histories generated by any\nsequence of finite accuracy macroscopic measurements always generate a\nconsistent family in the absence of large scale entanglement, for sufficiently\nlarge ensembles. Hence, macroscopic observables behave \"classically\" provided\nthat their accuracy is coarser than the quantum correlation length-scale of the\nsystem. The role of these observable is also discussed in the context of NMR\nquantum information processing and bulk ensemble quantum state tomography.",

Given a binary tree $T$ on $n$ leaves with a path metric $d$,\nconsider the pairwise distances $\\{d(u,v)\\}$ between leaves. It is well known\nthat these determine the tree and the $d$ length of all edges. Here we consider\ndistortions $\\d$ of $d$ such that for all leaves $u$ and $v$ it holds that\n$|d(u,v) - \\d(u,v)| < f/2$ if either $d(u,v) < M$ or $\\d(u,v) < M$, where $d$\nsatisfies $f \\leq d(e) \\leq g$ for all edges $e$. Given such distortions we\nshow how to reconstruct in polynomial time a forest $T_1,...,T_{\\alpha}$ such\nthat the true tree $T$ may be obtained from that forest by adding $\\alpha-1$\nedges and $\\alpha-1 \\leq 2^{-\\Omega(M/g)} n$.\n  Metric distortions arise naturally in phylogeny, where $d(u,v)$ is defined by\nthe log-det of a covariance matrix associated with $u$ and $v$. of a covariance\nmatrix associated with $u$ and $v$. When $u$ and $v$ are ``far'', the entries\nof the covariance matrix are small and therefore $\\d(u,v)$, which is defined by\nlog-det of an associated empirical-correlation matrix may be a bad estimate of\n$d(u,v)$ even if the correlation matrix is ``close'' to the covariance matrix.\n  Our metric results are used in order to show how to reconstruct phylogenetic\nforests with small number of trees from sequences of length logarithmic in the\nsize of the tree. Our method also yields an independent proof that phylogenetic\ntrees can be reconstructed in polynomial time from sequences of polynomial\nlength under the standard assumptions in phylogeny. Both the metric result and\nits applications to phylogeny are almost tight.",

Chandra detects 17 sources within the optical extent of NGC5253 down\nto a completeness level corresponding to a luminosity of 1.5E37 erg/s.The slope\nof the point source X-ray luminosity function is -0.54, similar to that of\nother nearby dwarf starburst galaxies. Several different types of source are\ndetected within the galaxy, including X-ray binaries and the emission\nassociated with star-clusters.\n  Comparison of the diffuse X-ray emission with the observed Halpha emission\nshows similarities in their extent. The best spectral fit to the diffuse\nemission is obtained with an absorbed, two temperature model giving\ntemperatures for the two gas components of ~0.24keV and ~0.75keV.The derived\nparameters of the diffuse X-ray emitting gas are as follows: a total mass of\n\\~1.4E6 f^{1/2} Msun, where f is the volume filling factor of the X-ray\nemitting gas, and a total thermal energy content for the hot X-ray emitting gas\nof \\~3.4E54 f^{1/2} erg.

As the field is increased, changes\nare observed in the magnetic Bragg intensities.

The\nantiferromagnetic ordering temperature TN = 13.5 K and the magnetic periodicity\nare unaffected by the applied field. We also report measurements of the\nmagnetic susceptibility of single crystal PrO2 under applied fields of 0-7 T.\nThese show strong anisotropy, as well as an anomaly at T = 122 +/- 2 K which\ncoincides with the temperature TD = 120 +/- 2 K at which a structural\ndistortion occurs. For fields applied along the [100] direction the\nsusceptibility increases irreversibly with field in the temperature range TN <\nT < TD. However, for fields along [110] the susceptibility is independent of\nfield in this range. We propose structural domain alignment, which strongly\ninfluences the formation of magnetic domains below TN, as the mechanism behind\nthese changes.",

There is also evidence for enhanced\nX-ray flux in the region between the two, where the temperature is higher than\nour expectations.\n  Although tidal or compression effects might affect the large scale structure\nof the two clusters, we show that these cannot account for the distortions seen\nin the inner regions. We argue that the reasonably relaxed morphology of the\nclusters, and the absence of major temperature anomalies, argues against models\nin which the two have already experienced a close encounter. The properties of\nthe intermediate region suggests that they are at an early stage of merging,\nand are currently interacting mildly, because their separation is still too\nlarge for more dramatic effects. The substructure we find in their inner\nregions seems to point to their individual merging histories.

In a previous timing study using archival ROSAT\nand ASCA data we reported evidence for an increase of this frequency at a rate\nconsistent with expectations for gravitational radiation from a detached\nultracompact binary system. Here we report the results of new CHANDRA timing\nobservations which confirm the previous indications of spin-up of the X-ray\nfrequency, and provide much tighter constraints on the frequency derivative. We\nobtained with CHANDRA a total of 90 ksec of exposure in two epochs separated in\ntime by 11.5 months. The total time span of the archival ROSAT, ASCA and new\nCHANDRA data is now 10.5 years. This more than doubles the interval spanned by\nthe ROSAT and ASCA data alone, providing much greater sensitivity to a\nfrequency derivative. With the addition of the CHANDRA data an increasing\nfrequency is unavoidable, with a value df/dt = 7.0 x 10-18 Hz/s. Although a\nlong-term spin-up trend is confirmed, there is excess variance in the phase\ntiming residuals, perhaps indicative of shorter timescale torque fluctuations\nor phase instability associated with the source of the X-ray flux. Power\nspectral searches for periods longward of the 9.5 minute period do not find any\nsignificant modulations, however, the sensitivity of searches in this frequency\nrange are somewhat compromised by the dithering of the Chandra attitude. The\nobserved spin-up is of a magnitude consistent with that expected from\ngravitational radiation decay, however, the factor of 3 variations in flux\ncombined with the timing noise could conceivably result from accretion-induced\nspin-up of a white dwarf. Continued monitoring to explore correlations of\ntorque with X-ray flux could provide a further test of this hypothesis.",

After correcting SNe magnitudes\nfor cosmological distances, assuming recently published, homogeneous distance\nand error estimates, we find that brighter SNe are preferentially found behind\nregions (5-15 arcmin radius) which are overdense in foreground, z~0.1 galaxies.\nThis is consistent with the interpretation that SNe fluxes are magnified by\nforeground galaxy excess, and demagnified by foreground galaxy deficit,\ncompared to a smooth Universe case. The difference between most magnified and\nmost demagnified SNe is about 0.3-0.4 mag. The effect is significant at >99%\nlevel. Simple modeling reveals that the slope of the relation between SN\nmagnitude and foreground galaxy density depends on the amount and distribution\nof matter along the line of sight to the sources, but does not depend on the\nspecifics of the galaxy biasing scheme.",

However, depolarization will introduce artifacts\nin the resulting rotation measure, most notably in the form of narrow,\nelongated ``depolarization canals''. We use numerical models of a non-emitting\nFaraday rotating medium to study the RM distribution needed to create\ndepolarization canals by depolarization due to a finite beam width, and to\nestimate the influence of this depolarization mechanism on the determination of\nRM. We argue that the depolarization canals indeed can be caused by beam\ndepolarization, which in turn is a natural consequence when observing a\nturbulent medium with limited resolution. Furthermore, we estimate that beam\ndepolarization can induce an additional error of about 20% in RM\ndeterminations, and considerably less in regions that are not affected by\ndepolarization canals.",

We exploit the fact\nthat option price and random arbitrage returns change on different time scales\nwhich allows us to develop an asymptotic pricing theory involving the central\nlimit theorem for random processes. We restrict ourselves to finding pricing\nbands for options rather than exact prices. The resulting pricing bands are\nshown to be independent of the detailed statistical characteristics of the\narbitrage return.

In leading order, this reduces to\nthe t'-t\"-Jz model, where there are regions of d-wave, s-wave, and (degenerate)\np-wave symmetry. We find that the t-Jz model maps in lowest order onto the\nt'-t\"-Jz model on the boundary between d and p symmetry, with a flat lower band\nin the pair excitation spectrum. In higher order, d-wave symmetry is selected\nfrom the lower pair band. However, we observe that the addition of the\nappropriate t'<0 and/or t''>0, the signs of t' and t\" found in the hole-doped\ncuprates, could drive the hole-pair symmetry to p-wave, implying the\npossibility of competition between p-wave and d-wave pair ground states. (An\nadded t'>0 and/or t\" <0 generally tend to promote d-wave symmetry.) We\nperturbatively construct an extended quasi-pair for the t-Jz model. In leading\norder, there are contributions from sites at a distance of sqrt{2} lattice\nspacings apart; however, contributions from sites 2 lattice spacings apart,\nalso of the same order, vanish identically.

In addition to O\nVI, we also identify emission lines due to C III 977, N III 991, S IV\n1062,1072, and He II 1085 in many of the Type-1 AGN. Of the Type 1 objects, 30\nshow intrinsic absorption by the O VI 1032,1038 doublet. Most of these\nintrinsic absorption systems show multiple components with intrinsic widths of\n100 km/s spread over a blue-shifted velocity range of less than 1000 km/s.\nGalaxies in our sample with existing X-ray or longer wavelength UV observations\nalso show C IV absorption and evidence of a soft X-ray warm absorber. In some\ncases, a UV absorption component has physical properties similar to the X-ray\nabsorbing gas, but in others there is no clear physical correspondence between\nthe UV and X-ray absorbing components. Models in which a thermally driven wind\nevaporates material from the obscuring torus naturally produce such\ninhomogeneous flows.",

This continuity property, when\ncombined with the proof that the wavefunction obtained with the generalized\nBethe Ansatz is normalizable, is relevant to the question of whether or not the\nsolution gives us the ground state of the finite system, as suggested by Lieb\nand Wu. Lastly, for the absolute ground state at half-filling, we show that the\nsolution converges to a distribution in the thermodynamic limit. This limit\ndistribution satisfies the integral equations that led to the well known\nsolution of the 1D Hubbard model.",

Averaging over Delta z=0.1 or 154\nMpc, the dispersion is 6.1 +/- 0.3% including LLS and metal lines, or 3.9\n(+0.5, -0.7)% for the lower density IGM alone, consistent with the usual\ndescription of large scale structure. LLS and metal lines are major\ncontributors to the variation in the mean flux, and they make the flux field\nsignificantly non-Gaussian. We find that a hydrodynamic simulation on a 1024\ncubed grid in a 75.7 Mpc box reproduces the observed DA from the low density\nIGM with parameters values H_o=71 km/s/Mpc, Omega_Lambda=0.73, Omega_m=0.27,\nOmega_b=0.044, sigma_8=0.9 and a UV background that has an ionization rate that\nis 1.08 +/- 0.08 times the prediction by Madau, Haardt & Rees (1999).",

These studies are designed to test how far the\nknown macroscopic approaches such as thermodynamics may be applicable in these\ncases. A brief review of the recent literature on these topics is given as a\nmotivation to introduce a generic approach called nanothermodynamics. An\nimportant feature that must be incorporated into the theory is the non-additive\nproperty because of the importance of surface contributions to the physics of\nthese systems. This is achieved by incorporating fluctuations into the theory\nright from the start. There are currently two approaches to incorporate this\nproperty. Hill (and further elaborated more recently with Chamberlin) initiated\nan approach by modifying the thermodynamic relations by taking into account the\nsurface effects. We generalize Boltzmann-Gibbs statistical mechanics by\nrelaxing the additivity properties of thermodynamic quantities to include\nnonextensive features of such systems. An outline of this generalization of the\nmacroscopic thermodynamics to nano-systems will be given here.",

    "summary": "In an effort to understand unusual power-law spectral slopes observed in some\nhypercompact HII regions, we consider the radio continuum energy distribution\nfrom an ensemble of spherical clumps. An analytic expression for the free-free\nemission from a single spherical clump is derived. The radio continuum slope\n(with F_\\nu \\nu^\\alpha) is governed by the population of clump optical depths\nN(tau), such that (a) at frequencies where all clumps are thick, a continuum\nslope of +2 is found, (b) at frequencies where all clumps are optically thin, a\nflattened slope of -0.11 is found, and (c) at intermediate frequencies, a\npower-law segment of significant bandwidth with slopes between these two\nlimiting values can result. For the ensemble distribution, we adopt a power-law\ndistribution N(tau) tau^{-\\gamma}, and find that significant power-law segments\nin the SED with slopes from +2 to -0.11 result only for a relatively restricted\nrange of $\\gamma$ values of 1 to 2. Further, a greater range of clump optical\ndepths for this distribution leads to a wider bandwidth over which the\nintermediate power-law segment exists. The model is applied to the source\nW49N-B2 with an observed slope of \\alphab +0.9, but that may be turning over to\nbecome optically thin around 2 mm. An adequate fit is found in which most\nclumps are optically thin and there is little shadowing of rearward clumps by\nforeground clumps (i.e., the geometrical covering factor C<<1). The primary\ninsight gained from our study is that in the Rayleigh-Jeans limit for the\nPlanck function that applies for the radio band, it is the distribution in\noptical depth of the clump population that is solely responsible for setting\nthe continuum shape, with variations in the size and temperature of clumps\nserving to modulate the level of free-free emission.",

    "summary": "We present three-dimensional simulations of viscous dissipation of AGN\ninduced gas motions and waves in clusters of galaxies. These simulations are\nmotivated by recent detections of ripples in the Perseus and Virgo clusters.\nAlthough the sound waves generated by buoyant bubbles decay with distance from\nthe cluster center, we show that these waves can contribute substantially to\noffsetting the radiative cooling at distances significantly exceeding the\nbubble size. The energy flux of the waves declines more steeply with radius\nthan the inverse-square law predicted by energy conservation, implying that\ndissipation plays an important role in tapping the wave energy. We show that\nsuch dispersing sound waves/weak shocks are detectable as ripples on\nunsharp-masked X-ray cluster maps, and point out that the interfaces between\nthe intracluster medium and old bubbles are also clearly detectable in\nunsharp-masked X-ray maps. This opens up the possibility of detecting fossil\nbubbles that are difficult to detect in radio emission. This mode of heating is\nconsistent with other observational constraints, such as the presence of cool\nrims around the bubbles and the absence of strong shocks. Thus, the mechanism\noffers a way of heating clusters in a spatially distributed and gentle fashion.\nWe also discuss the energy transfer between the central AGN and the surrounding\nmedium. In our numerical experiments, we find that roughly 65 per cent of the\nenergy injected by the AGN is transferred to the intracluster medium and\napproximately 25 percent of the injected energy is dissipated by viscous\neffects and contributes to heating of the gas. The overall transfer of heat\nfrom the AGN to the gas is comparable to the radiative cooling losses. The\nsimulations were performed with the FLASH adaptive mesh refinement code.",

MOND requires\ngravitation to depart from Newtonian theory in the extragalactic regime where\ndynamical accelerations are small. So far relativistic gravitation theories\nproposed to underpin MOND have either clashed with the post-Newtonian tests of\ngeneral relativity, or failed to provide significant gravitational lensing, or\nviolated hallowed principles by exhibiting superluminal scalar waves or an\n\\textit{a priori} vector field. We develop a relativistic MOND inspired theory\nwhich resolves these problems. In it gravitation is mediated by metric, a\nscalar field and a 4-vector field, all three dynamical. For a simple choice of\nits free function, the theory has a Newtonian limit for nonrelativistic\ndynamics with significant acceleration, but a MOND limit when accelerations are\nsmall. We calculate the $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ PPN coefficients showing them to\nagree with solar system measurements. The gravitational light deflection by\nnonrelativistic systems is governed by the same potential responsible for\ndynamics of particles. To the extent that MOND successfully describes dynamics\nof a system, the new theory's predictions for lensing by that system's visible\nmatter will agree as well with observations as general relativity's predictions\nmade with a dynamically successful dark halo model. Cosmological models based\non the theory are quite similar to those based on general relativity; they\npredict slow evolution of the scalar field.

In our framework this state is harder to bind than the Theta+\ndescribed by a k-pi-N borromean bound-state, a lower binding energy is expected\nin agreement with the H1 observation. Multiquark molecules N-pi-D, N-pi-B* and\nN-pi-B are also predicted.",

This classical problem\nhas been studied extensively in the theory of solidification from a flowing\nmelt, and it also arises in Advection-Diffusion-Limited Aggregation. In both\ncases, the fundamental object is the flux to a circular disk, obtained by\nconformal mapping from more complicated shapes. We construct the first accurate\nnumerical solution using an efficient new method, which involves mapping to the\ninterior of the disk and using a spectral method in polar coordinates. Our\nmethod also combines exact asymptotics and an adaptive mesh to handle boundary\nlayers. Starting from a well-known integral equation in streamline coordinates,\nwe also derive new, high-order asymptotic expansions for high and low P\\'eclet\nnumbers ($\\Pe$). Remarkably, the `high' $\\Pe$ expansion remains accurate even\nfor such low $\\Pe$ as $10^{-3}$. The two expansions overlap well near $\\Pe =\n0.1$, allowing the construction of an analytical connection formula that is\nuniformly accurate for all $\\Pe$ and angles on the disk with a maximum relative\nerror of 1.75%. We also obtain an analytical formula for the Nusselt number\n($\\Nu$) as a function of the P\\'eclet number with a maximum relative error of\n0.53% for all possible geometries. Because our finite-plate problem can be\nconformally mapped to other geometries, the general problem of two-dimensional\nadvection-diffusion past an arbitrary finite absorber in a potential flow can\nbe considered effectively solved.",

    "summary": "On large scales galaxies and their halos are usually assumed to trace the\ndark matter with a constant bias and dark matter is assumed to trace the linear\ndensity field. We test these assumption using several large N-body simulations\nwith 384^3-1024^3 particles and box sizes between 100-1000h/Mpc, which can both\nresolve the small galactic size halos and sample the large scale fluctuations.\nWe explore the average halo bias relation as a function of halo mass and show\nthat existing fitting formulae overestimate the halo bias by up to 20% in the\nregime just below the nonlinear mass. We propose a new expression that fits our\nsimulations well. We find that the halo bias is nearly constant, b~0.65-0.7,\nfor masses below one tenth of the nonlinear mass. We explore next the relation\nbetween the initial and final dark matter in individual Fourier modes and show\nthat there are significant fluctuations in their ratio, ranging from 10% rms at\nk~0.03h/Mpc to 50% rms at k~0.1h/Mpc. We argue that these large fluctuations\nare caused by perturbative effects beyond the linear theory, which are\ndominated by long wavelength modes with large random fluctuations. Similar or\nlarger fluctuations exist between halos and dark matter and between halos of\ndifferent mass. While these fluctuations are small compared to the sampling\nvariance, they are significant for attempts to determine the bias by relating\ndirectly the maps of galaxies and dark matter or the maps of different galaxy\npopulations, which would otherwise be immune to sampling variance.",
