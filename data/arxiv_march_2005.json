The numerical rank is always bounded by, and is a stable\nrelaxation of, the rank of A. This yields an asymptotically optimal guarantee\nin an algorithm for computing low-rank approximations of A. We also prove\nasymptotically optimal estimates on the spectral norm and the cut-norm of\nrandom submatrices of A. The result for the cut-norm yields a slight\nimprovement on the best known sample complexity for an approximation algorithm\nfor MAX-2CSP problems. We use methods of Probability in Banach spaces, in\nparticular the law of large numbers for operator-valued random variables.",

Magnetization measurements\nreveal that for Zn-free samples with $x \\geq 0.22$ a Curie term is induced in\nthe temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility implying the\nexistence of local paramagnetic moments. The induced Curie constant corresponds\nto a moment of 0.5 $\\mu_B$ per additional Sr$^{2+}$ ion that exceeds $x=0.22$.\nZn-substitution in the overdoped \\lsco also induces a Curie term that\ncorresponds to 1.2 $\\mu_B$ per Zn$^{2+}$ ion, simultaneously suppressing $T_c$.\nThe relationship between $T_c$ and the magnitude of the Curie term for Zn-free\n\\lsco with $x \\geq 0.22$ and for Zn-substituted \\lsco with $x = 0.22$ are\nclosely similar. This signifies a general competitive relationship between the\nsuperconductivity and the induced paramagnetic moment. Neutron scattering\nmeasurements show that Zn-substitution in overdoped \\lsco anomalously enhances\nthe inelastic magnetic scattering spectra around the $(\\pi, \\pi)$ position,\npeaking at $\\omega \\sim 7$ meV.

The\ndifference decreases with later types, becoming negligible by B0 V. A similar\ndifference is found for the supergiants. (2) The wind momentum of these stars\nscales with luminosity and metallicty in the ways predicted by\nradiatively-driven wind theory. (3) A comparison of the masses derived from\nspectroscopy with those derived from stellar evolutionary theory shows a\nsignificant discrepancy for stars hotter than 45000, although good agreement is\nfound for cooler stars. (4) For the hottest O stars (O2-3.5) neither the\nNIII/NIV ratio, nor even the HeI/HeII ratio, does a good job of predicting the\neffective temperature by itself. Instead, a full analysis is needed to derive\nphysical parameters. Thus there are O3.5V stars which are as hot or hotter than\nstars classified as O2V. (5) The two stars with the most discordant radial\nvelocities in our sample happen to be O3 \"field stars\". This provides the first\ncompelling observational evidence that the \"field\" O stars in the Magellanic\nClouds may be runaway OB stars, ejected from their birth place.",

Our approach performs an expansion in\nterms of the natural smallness parameter -- the inverse of the scaled degree of\npolymerization, which allows us to systematically study the approach to\nmean-field behavior as the degree of polymerization increases. We find that in\nthe limit of infinite long polymer chains, both the onset of glassiness and the\nvitrification transition (Kauzmann temperature) collapse to the mean-field\nspinodal, suggesting that the spinodal can be regarded as the mean-field\nsignature for glass transitions in this class of systems. We also study the\norder-disorder transitions (ODT) within the same theoretical framework; in\nparticular, we include the leading-order fluctuation corrections due to the\ncubic interaction in the coarse-grained Hamiltonian, which has been ignored in\nprevious works on the ODT in block copolymers. We find that the cubic term\nstabilizes both the ordered (body-centered-cubic) phase and the glassy state\nrelative to the disordered phase. While in melts of symmetric copolymers the\nglass transition always occurs after the order-disorder transition (below the\nODT temperature), for asymmetric copolymers, it is possible that the glass\ntransition precedes the ordering transition.",

For T Tauri disks, the lifetimes of dust disks\nthat are mainly composed of millimeter sized grains are always shorter than the\ngas disks' lifetimes, and become similar only when the grains are fluffy\n(density < 0.1 g cm^{-3}). If grain growth during the classical T Tauri phase\nproduces plenty of millimeter sized grains, such grains completely accrete onto\nthe star in 10^7 yr, before photoevaporation begins to drain the inner gas disk\nand the star evolves to the weak line T Tauri phase. In the weak line phase,\nonly dust-poor gas disks remain at large radii (> 10 AU), without strong signs\nof gas accretion nor of millimeter thermal emission from the dust. For Herbig\nAeBe stars, the strong photoevaporation clears the inner disks in 10^6 yr,\nbefore the dust grains in the outer disk migrate to the inner region. In this\ncase, the grains left behind in the outer gas disk accumulate at the disk inner\nedge (at 10-100 AU from the star). The dust grains remain there even after the\nentire gas disk has been photoevaporated, and form a gas-poor dust ring similar\nto that observed around HR 4796A. Hence, depending on the strength of the\nstellar ionizing flux, our model predicts opposite types of products around\nyoung stars. For low mass stars with a low photoevaporation rate, dust-poor gas\ndisks with an inner hole would form, whereas for high mass stars with a high\nphotoevaporation rate, gas-poor dust rings would form. This prediction should\nbe examined by observations of gas and dust around weak line T Tauri stars and\nevolved Herbig AeBe stars.",

In this paper\nwe provide a unifying view of these apparently different tasks, by considering\na family of {\\em diffusion maps}, defined as the embedding of complex (high\ndimensional) data onto a low dimensional Euclidian space, via the eigenvectors\nof suitably defined random walks defined on the given datasets. Assuming that\nthe data is randomly sampled from an underlying general probability\ndistribution $p(\\x)=e^{-U(\\x)}$, we show that as the number of samples goes to\ninfinity, the eigenvectors of each diffusion map converge to the eigenfunctions\nof a corresponding differential operator defined on the support of the\nprobability distribution. Different normalizations of the Markov chain on the\ngraph lead to different limiting differential operators. One normalization\ngives the Fokker-Planck operators with the same potential U(x), best suited for\nthe study of stochastic differential equations as well as for clustering.\nAnother normalization gives the Laplace-Beltrami (heat) operator on the\nmanifold in which the data resides, best suited for the analysis of the\ngeometry of the dataset, regardless of its possibly non-uniform density.",

The equilibrium state and the field dependence of the magnon\nenergy gap $E_0$ are calculated for static magnetic field $H$ applied in plane\nalong an easy or a hard axis. In the latter case, the in-plane reorientation of\nthe magnetization is shown to be continuous at T=0, in agreement with free spin\nwave theory, and discontinuous at finite temperature $T>0$, in contrast with\nthe prediction of mean field theory. The discontinuity in the orientation angle\ncreates a jump in the magnon energy gap, and it is the reason why, for $T>0$,\nthe energy does not go to zero at the reorientation field. Above the Curie\ntemperature $T_C$, the magnon energy gap $E_0(H)$ vanishes for H=0 both in the\neasy and in the hard case. As $H$ is increased, the gap is found to increase\nalmost linearly with $H$, but with different slopes depending on the field\norientation. In particular, the slope is smaller when $H$ is along the hard\naxis. Such a magnetic anisotropy of the spin-wave energies is shown to persist\nwell above $T_C$ ($T \\approx 1.2 T_C$).",

We construct A_{\\infty}\nalgebras A for every dimension D=3,4,6,10, which for D=10 coincides with\nhomogeneous coordinate ring of pure spinors with coordinate lambda^{alpha}.\nThese algebras are Bar-dual to Lie algebras generated by supersymmetries,\nwritten in components. The algebras have a finite number of higher\nmultiplications. The main result of the present note is that in dimension\nD=3,6,10 the algebra A\\otimes \\Lambda[\\theta^{\\alpha}]\\otimes Mat_n with a\ndifferential D is equivalent to Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra of minimally\nsupersymmetric YM theory in dimension D reduced to a point. This statement can\nbe extended to nonreduced theories.",

Broad-band images were used to study the morphology of the host\ngalaxy, narrow-band H-alpha images to trace the star forming regions, and\nmiddle-band [O III] images to evidence the distribution of the highly ionised\ngas. Some extended emission regions were isolated and their physical properties\nstudied by means of flux calibrated spectra. High resolution spectroscopy was\nused to separate different kinematic components in the velocity fields of gas\nand stars. Some peculiar features characterise this apparently undisturbed and\nmoderately isolated active galaxy. Such features, already investigated by other\nauthors, are re-analysed and discussed in the light of these new observations.\nThe most relevant results we obtained are: the multi-tiers structure of the\ndisc; the presence of a quasi-ring of regions with star formation much higher\nthan previous claims; a secondary nucleus confirmed by a stellar component\nkinematically decoupled by the main galaxy; a new hypothesis about the\ncontroversial nature of the long filament, initially described as hook-shaped,\nand more likely made of two independent filaments caused by interaction events\nbetween the main galaxy and two dwarf companions.",

However, in\nits experimental program, which is focused mainly on studies of high energy\ntransfer collisions of Standard Model point-like particles, protons and ions\nwill play a backstage role. For the majority of the LHC experimentalists, their\nrole will be confined to providing standardized, acceleration-process-stable\nenvelopes for tunable-density and tunable-isospin bunches of Standard Model\nconstituents: quarks and gluons. The inter-bunch environment of collisions of\nthese Standard Model particles specific to hadronic colliders and absent in the\nleptonic ones, has always been considered as a burden - an annoying but\nunavoidable price to pay for increasing the collision-energy of point-like\nparticles in the storage rings.

The current-voltage characteristics of FTJs are analyzed\nunder the assumption that the direct electron tunneling represents the dominant\nconduction mechanism. First, the influence of converse piezoelectric effect\ninherent in ferroelectric materials on the tunnel current is described. The\ncalculations show that the lattice strains of piezoelectric origin modify the\ncurrent-voltage relationship owing to strain-induced changes of the barrier\nthickness, electron effective mass, and position of the conduction-band edge.\nRemarkably, the conductance minimum becomes shifted from zero voltage due to\nthe piezoelectric effect, and a strain-related resistive switching takes place\nafter the polarization reversal in a ferroelectric barrier. Second, we analyze\nthe influence of the internal electric field arising due to imperfect screening\nof polarization charges by electrons in metal electrodes. It is shown that, for\nasymmetric FTJs, this depolarizing-field effect also leads to a considerable\nchange of the barrier resistance after the polarization reversal. However, the\nsymmetry of the resulting current-voltage loop is different from that\ncharacteristic of the strain-related resistive switching. The crossover from\none to another type of the hysteretic curve, which accompanies the increase of\nFTJ asymmetry, is described taking into account both the strain and\ndepolarizing-field effects. It is noted that asymmetric FTJs with dissimilar\ntop and bottom electrodes are preferable for the non-volatile memory\napplications because of a larger resistance on/off ratio.",

    "summary": "We discuss the results of two XMM-Newton observations of the open cluster\nNGC6604 obtained in April and September 2002. We concentrate mainly on the\nmultiple system HD167971 (O5-8V + O5-8V + (O8I)). The soft part of the EPIC\nspectrum of this system is thermal with typical temperatures of about 2 10^6 to\n9 10^6 K. The nature (thermal vs non-thermal) of the hard part of the spectrum\nis not unambiguously revealed by our data. If the emission is thermal, the high\ntemperature of the plasma (~ 2.3 10^7 to 4.6 10^7 K) would be typical of what\nshould be expected from a wind-wind interaction zone within a long period\nbinary system. This emission could arise from an interaction between the\ncombined winds of the O5-8V + O5-8V close binary system and that of the more\ndistant O8I companion. Assuming instead that the hard part of the spectrum is\nnon-thermal, the photon index would be rather steep (~3). Moreover, a marginal\nvariability between our two XMM-Newton pointings could be attributed to an\neclipse of the O5-8V + O5-8V system. The overall X-ray luminosity points to a\nsignificant X-ray luminosity excess of about a factor 4 possibly due to\ncolliding winds. Considering HD167971 along with several recent X-ray and radio\nobservations, we propose that the simultaneous observation of non-thermal\nradiation in the X-ray (below 10.0 keV) and radio domains appears rather\nunlikely. Our investigation of our XMM-Newton data of NGC6604 reveals a rather\nsparse distribution of X-ray emitters. Including the two bright non-thermal\nradio emitters HD168112 and HD167971, we present a list of 31 X-ray sources...\n(see paper for full abstract)",

We discuss certain key features of some braneworld black hole\ngeometries. Such black holes are likely to have diverse cosmological and\nastrophysical ramifications. The cosmological evolution of primordial\nbraneworld black holes is described highlighting their longevity due to\nmodified evaporation and effective accretion of radiation during the early\nbraneworld high energy era. Observational abundance of various evaporation\nproducts of the black holes at different eras impose constraints on their\ninitial mass fraction. Surviving primordial black holes could be candidates of\ndark matter present in galactic haloes. We discuss gravitational lensing by\nbraneworld black holes.

By ``dynamic'' we mean that in the course of\na single simulation, the change of measure can depend on the outcome of the\nsimulation up till that time. Based on a control-theoretic approach to large\ndeviations, the existence of asymptotically optimal dynamic schemes is\ndemonstrated in great generality.

We apply this continuation to the problem of gauge theories coupled to\nmatter, and propose a new distinction, perimeter law versus \"zero law\" to\nidentify confinement.

We show that local gauge invariance is\ntopological and cannot be broken by any local perturbations in the bosonic\nmodels in either continuous or discrete gauge groups.

    "summary": "We present a wide-field imaging study of the colors of bright galaxies in 12\nX-ray selected clusters and groups of galaxies at z ~ 0.3. The systems cover\none of the largest ranges in X-ray luminosity (Lx ~ 10^43 - 10^45 erg/s), and\nhence mass, of any sample studied at this redshift. We find that the `red'\ngalaxies form a tight color-magnitude relation (CMR) and that neither the slope\nnor zero-point of this relation changes significantly over the factor of 100 in\nX-ray luminosity of our sample. Using stellar population synthesis models we\nfind our data allow a maximum possible change of 2 Gyrs in the typical age of\nthe galaxies on the CMR over the range of Lx of our sample. We also measure the\nfraction of blue galaxies (fb) relative to the CMR in our clusters and find a\nlow value of fb ~ 0.1 and find that there is no correlation between fb and Lx\nover our large Lx range. However, both the CMR and fb do depend on cluster\nradius, with the zero-point of the CMR shifting blueward in B-R by 0.10 +/-\n0.036 magnitudes out to 0.75 times the virial radius, equivalent to a\nluminosity weighted age gradient of ~ 2.5 Gyrs per log(radius). It thus appears\nthat the global cluster environment, in the form of cluster mass (Lx), has\nlittle influence on the properties of bright cluster galaxies, whereas the\nlocal environment, in the form of galaxy density (radius), has a strong effect.\nThe range of ~ 100 in Lx corresponds to a factor of ~ 40 in ram-pressure\nefficiency, suggesting that ram-pressure stripping, or other mechanisms that\ndepend on cluster mass like tidal stripping or harassment, are unlikely to be\nsolely responsible for changing the galaxy population from the `blue' star\nforming galaxies, that dominate low density environments, to the `red' passive\ngalaxies that dominate cluster cores.(abridged)",

We consider the dynamics of weakly nonlinear wave\npackets, and using an asymptotic multiple-scales expansion we obtain a suite of\nevolution equations to describe energy exchange between the two components of\nthe system. Depending on the wave packet length-scale vis-a-vis the wave\namplitude scale, these evolution equations are either four non-dispersive and\nnonlinearly coupled envelope equations, or four non-locally coupled nonlinear\nSchroedinger equations. We also consider a set of fully coupled nonlinear\nSchroedinger equations, even though this system contains small dispersive terms\nwhich are strictly beyond the leading order of the asymptotic multiple-scales\nexpansion method. Using both the theoretical predictions following from these\nasymptotic models and numerical simulations of the original unapproximated\nequations, we investigate the stability of plane-wave solutions, and show that\nthey may be modulationally unstable. These instabilities can then lead to the\nformation of localized structures, and to a modification of the energy exchange\nbetween the components. When the system is close to being integrable, the\ntime-evolution is distinguished by a remarkable almost periodic sequence of\nenergy exchange scenarios, with spatial patterns alternating between\napproximately uniform wavetrains and localized structures.",

    "summary": "An unified picture for the Raman response of magnetic excitations in cuprate\nspin-ladder compounds is obtained by comparing calculated two-triplon Raman\nline-shapes with those of the prototypical compounds SrCu2O3 (Sr123),\nSr14Cu24O41 (Sr14), and La6Ca8Cu24O41 (La6Ca8). The theoretical model for the\ntwo-leg ladder contains Heisenberg exchange couplings J_parallel and J_perp\nplus an additional four-spin interaction J_cyc. Within this model Sr123 and\nSr14 can be described by x:=J_parallel/J_perp=1.5, x_cyc:=J_cyc/J_perp=0.2,\nJ_perp^Sr123=1130 cm^-1 and J_perp^Sr14=1080 cm^-1. The couplings found for\nLa6Ca8 are x=1.2, x_cyc=0.2, and J_perp^La6Ca8=1130 cm^-1. The unexpected sharp\ntwo-triplon peak in the ladder materials compared to the undoped\ntwo-dimensional cuprates can be traced back to the anisotropy of the magnetic\nexchange in rung and leg direction. With the results obtained for the isotropic\nladder we calculate the Raman line-shape of a two-dimensional square lattice\nusing a toy model consisting of a vertical and a horizontal ladder. A direct\ncomparison of these results with Raman experiments for the two-dimensional\ncuprates R2CuO4 (R=La,Nd), Sr2CuO2Cl2, and YBa2Cu3O(6+delta) yields a good\nagreement for the dominating two-triplon peak. We conclude that short range\nquantum fluctuations are dominating the magnetic Raman response in both,\nladders and planes. We discuss possible scenarios responsible for the\nhigh-energy spectral weight of the Raman line-shape, i.e. phonons, the\ntriple-resonance and multi-particle contributions.",

In this context progress\nhas also been accomplished on establishing an absolute lower limit to the\nirreducible mass of the black hole as well as on some critical considerations\nabout the relations of general relativity and the second law of thermodynamics.\nWe recall how this last issue has been one of the most debated in theoretical\nphysics in the past thirty years due to the work of Bekenstein and Hawking.\nFollowing these conceptual progresses we analyze the vacuum polarization\nprocess around an overcritical collapsing shell. We evidence the existence of a\nseparatrix and a dyadosphere trapping surface in the dynamics of the\nelectron-positron plasma generated during the process of gravitational\ncollapse. We then analyze, using recent progress in the solution of the\nVlasov-Boltzmann-Maxwell system, the oscillation regime in the created\nelectron-positron plasma and their rapid convergence to a thermalized spectrum.\nWe conclude by making precise predictions for the spectra, the energy fluxes\nand characteristic time-scales of the radiation for short-bursts. If the\nprecise luminosity variation and spectral hardening of the radiation we have\npredicted will be confirmed by observations of short-bursts, these systems will\nplay a major role as standard candles in cosmology. These considerations will\nalso be relevant for the analysis of the long-bursts when the baryonic matter\ncontribution will be taken into account.",

The analysis reveals that the object was in the decline from an outburst\nin 1992 and again in outburst in 2001. The historical light curve collected by\namateur astronomers shows low amplitude (1-2 mag) outbursts 5-10 days long,\nrecurrent every 80-90 days, confirming its dwarf nova nature. We derive an\noutburst decline time scale of 1.2 days mag$^{-1}$. Eclipse mapping techniques\nwere applied to data both in quiescence and in outburst to derive accretion\ndisc surface brightness maps. A distance of $d = 170 \\pm 30$ pc is obtained\nfrom a method similar to that used to constrain the distance to open clusters.\n  From this distance, disc radial brightness temperature distributions are\ndetermined. The temperatures in the quiescent disc vary from $6 000$ K in the\ninner regions to $3 000$ K near the outer disc and are flatter than the $T\n\\propto r^{-{3/4}}$ law for optically thick steady-state disc. The outburst\noccurs mainly with a significant increase in brightness of the intermediate and\nouter disc regions. The disc temperatures remain below the critical effective\ntemperature $T_{\\rm crit}$ at all disc radii during outburst. The radial\ntemperature distributions in quiescence and in outburst are significantly\ndifferent from those of other dwarf novae of similar orbital period. These\nresults cannot be explained within the framework of the disc instability model.\nWe suggest that the small amplitude outbursts of V4140 Sgr are caused by bursts\nof enhanced mass transfer rate from the secondary star.",

Located in a 72 arcmin-squared field centered on the\nbright background QSO, HS1700+643, these galaxies were pre-selected to lie at\nz~2 based solely on their rest-frame UV colors and luminosities, and should be\nrepresentative of UV-selected samples at high redshift. In addition to deep\nground-based photometry spanning from 0.35-2.15 microns, we make use of\nSpitzer/IRAC data, which probes the rest-frame near-IR at z~2. The range of\nstellar populations present in the sample is investigated with simple,\nsingle-component stellar population synthesis models. Emphasizing stellar mass\nestimates, which are less subject to systematic uncertainties than other\nparameters, we find <log(M*/Msun)>=10.32+/-0.51 for the sample. Allowing for\nthe possibility of episodic star formation, we find that typical galaxies in\nour sample could contain up to three times more stellar mass in an old\nunderlying burst than what was inferred from single-component modeling. In\ncontrast, mass estimates for the most massive galaxies in the sample (M*>10^11\nMsun) are fairly insensitive to the method used to model the stellar\npopulation. Galaxies in this massive tail, which are also the oldest objects in\nthe sample, could plausibly evolve into the passive galaxies discovered at\nz~1.7 with near-IR selection techniques. In the general framework of\nhierarchical galaxy formation and mergers, which implies episodic\nstar-formation histories, galaxies at high redshift may pass in and out of\nUV-selected and near-IR color-selected samples as they evolve from phases of\nactive star formation to quiescence and back again (Abridged).",

We also identify a clear infrared bump in the\nspectral energy distributions of these QSOs, thereby indicating that the\nobserved mid-infrared fluxes originate from a hot dust torus around a QSO\nnucleus. Based on the size estimate of the dust torus, we place limits on the\nmass of a substructure in these lens systems, causing the anomalous optical or\nradio flux ratios.

This motivates the rigorous consideration\nof Higgs potentials, symmetry breaking patterns and alternative symmetry\nbreaking mechanisms in models with this gauge group. Specifically, we study the\nrecently proposed ``clash of symmetries'' brane-world mechanism to see if it\ncan help with the symmetry breaking conundrum. This requires a detailed\nanalysis of Higgs potential global minima and kink or domain wall solutions\ninterpolating between the disconnected global minima created through\nspontaneous discrete symmetry breaking. Sufficiently long-lived metastable\nkinks can also be considered. We develop what we think is an interesting,\nalbeit speculative, brane-world scheme whereby the hierarchical symmetry\nbreaking cascade, trinification to left-right symmetry to the standard model to\ncolour cross electromagnetism, may be induced without an initial hierarchy in\nvacuum expectation values. Another motivation for this paper is simply to\ncontinue the exploration of the rich class of kinks arising in models that are\ninvariant under both discrete and continuous symmetries.",

Several recent papers refer to this parameter as the \\emph{stopping\ndistance} $s$ of $C$. This is somewhat of a misnomer since the size of the\nsmallest stopping set in the Tanner graph for $C$ depends on the corresponding\nchoice of a parity-check matrix. It is easy to see that $s \\le d$, where $d$ is\nthe minimum Hamming distance of $C$, and we show that it is always possible to\nchoose a parity-check matrix for $C$ (with sufficiently many dependent rows)\nsuch that $s = d$. We thus introduce a new parameter, termed the \\emph{stopping\nredundancy} of $C$, defined as the minimum number of rows in a parity-check\nmatrix $H$ for $C$ such that the corresponding stopping distance $s(H)$ attains\nits largest possible value, namely $s(H) = d$.\n  We then derive general bounds on the stopping redundancy of linear codes. We\nalso examine several simple ways of constructing codes from other codes, and\nstudy the effect of these constructions on the stopping redundancy.\nSpecifically, for the family of binary Reed-Muller codes (of all orders), we\nprove that their stopping redundancy is at most a constant times their\nconventional redundancy. We show that the stopping redundancies of the binary\nand ternary extended Golay codes are at most 35 and 22, respectively. Finally,\nwe provide upper and lower bounds on the stopping redundancy of MDS codes.",

On the other hand, the swelling of wood in water,\nethylene glycol and alcohols remained unchanged or decreased by the\nacetylation.

The effect of acetylation on the maximum\nswollen volume of wood was greater in liquids having smaller solubility\nparameters. The easier penetration of aprotic organic liquids into the\nacetylated wood was considered to be due to the scission of hydrogen bonds\namong the amorphous wood constituents by the substitution of hydroxyl groups\nwith hydrophobic acetyl groups.",

The fairly good performance of double-zeta plus polarization\nbasis sets for frequencies results from an error compensation between basis set\nincompleteness and the intrinsic error of exchange-correlation functionals.\nTriple-zeta plus polarization basis sets are recommended, with an additional\nhigh-exponent $d$ function on second-row atoms.

Combining deep X-ray data with Lyman Break Galaxy (LBG)\ncolour-selection in the rest-frame UV makes for highly efficient identification\nof AGN in a narrow redshift range (z~2.5-3.5). Using Chandra data from the\nGroth-Westphal Strip and the Hubble Deep Field North, we find a total of 15\nX-ray detected LBGs at z~3, the majority of which are unlikely to have been\nidentified in blanket followup surveys of X-ray detected objects. We find the\ncomoving space density of moderate luminosity AGN at z=3 to be a factor ~10\nhigher than the most powerful objects. The available data are consistent with a\nroughly constant space density of MLAGN from z=0.5-3, and they are also\nconsistent with a mild decline in the space density above z=1 as predicted by\nthe luminosity-dependent density evolution models of Ueda et al. (2003). This\nstrong AGN activity at z=3 argues against previous suggestions that the\nmajority of black hole accretion occurs at low redshift. A further implication\nof our investigation is that, as far as can be determined from current data,\nthe majority of the AGN population at z~3 are selected by the LBG dropout\ntechnique. Although this is sensitive to AGN with a UV-excess due to an\naccretion disk, it predominantly identifies star-forming galaxies. A\nsignificant fraction of X-ray sources seem likely to be hosted by these more\ntypical LBGs, further strengthening the starburst-AGN connection at high\nredshift.",

This lattice that corresponds to graphs\ncontaining n vertices is called an n-lattice and is made up of certain rows of\nvertex pairs (i, j). Each row of this n-lattice is made up of those\nvertex-pairs, say (i, j), for which the difference|i - j| is the same for every\nvertex-pair belonging to that row, and where i, j belongs to set {1, 2, ...,\nn}.

The second row of this n-lattice contains (n - 2)\nvertex pairs, (i, i + 2), i = 1, 2, ..., (n - 2). In this way, one goes down to\nthe last row of this lattice which contains only one vertex-pair, (1, n). A\nlattice path is one made up of (n - 1) vertex pairs such that every row of the\ntriangular lattice contributes exactly one vertex pair to this lattice path. We\nobtain all possible lattice paths without omission or repetition by generating\nthem in a systematic way, in a well-defined lexicographic order. The collection\nof all such lattice paths forms all possible graceful graphs. We will note\nvarious observations related to these lattice paths. For example, the lattice\npaths appear in symmetric pairs, i.e. for each lattice path there exists a\ncorresponding unique lattice path which is the mirror image of this lattice\npath taken in the line of symmetry passing vertically and centrally through the\nlattice, each lattice path and its corresponding mirror image represent\nisomorphic graceful graphs.

    "summary": "Large neutrino mixing angles suggest that the Yukawa sector is invariant\nunder permutations of the fermion families. This S_{3} permutation symmetry is\nbroken at a large energy scale but much below the unification scale. Assuming\nthat the lepton mass matrix is approximately diagonal, all neutrino mixing\nangles naturally come from the breaking of S_{3}-> S_{2}. In the neutrino\nsector, S_{2} remains (approximately) unbroken. As a consequence, we have a\nlarge atmospheric neutrino angle and U_{e3}=0. The S_{3} symmetry at the\nunification scale can also explain the large solar mixing angle. We give an\nexplicit expression of the solar mixing angle in terms of the left-handed\nneutrino masses. We observe that this family permutation symmetry comes very\nnaturally from a quantized theory of functionals [1], that is an extension of\nquantum field theory.",

If the stellar B component is allowed to cool slowly\nits virial evolution consists of a sequence of contractions with enough time to\nrearrange the virial equilibrium after any step. The thermodynamic process\nduring the dynamical evolution is so divided into a sequence of transformations\nwhich are irreversible but occur between two quasi-equilibrium stages.The\nanalysis allows the conclusion that the induced scale length is a real\nconfinement for the stellar system. The presence of this specific border on the\nspace of the baryonic luminous component has to be regarded as the physical\nreason why a stellar galaxy belongs to the FP and why astrophysical objects,\nwith a completely different history and formation, but characterized by a tidal\nradius (as the globular clusters are) lie on the same FP. An other problem\naddressed is how this special configuration may be reached and why an\nelliptical is not completely relaxed in respect to its dark halo.",

We are using a total\nof 70 XMM-Newton fields covering an area of 11 sq. degrees which overlap with\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release-2. `Normal' galaxies are selected on\nthe basis of their resolved optical light profile, their low X-ray--to--optical\nflux ratio (log(f_x/f_o)<-2) and soft X-ray colours. We find a total of 28\ncandidate `normal' galaxies to the 0.5-8 keV band flux limit of ~2x10^{-15}\ncgs. Optical spectra are available for most sources in our sample (82 per\ncent). These provide additional evidence that our sources are bona-fide\n'normal' galaxies with X-ray emission coming from diffuse hot gas emission\nand/or X-ray binaries rather than a supermassive black hole. Sixteen of our\ngalaxies have narrow emission lines or a late-type Spectral Energy Distribution\n(SED) while the remaining 12 present only absorption lines or an early-type\nSED. Combining our XMM-Newton sample with 18 local (z<0.22) galaxies from the\nChandra Deep Field North and South surveys, we construct the local X-ray\nluminosity function of `normal' galaxies. This can be represented with a\nSchechter form with a break at L* ~ 3x10^{41} cgs and a slope of ~1.78+/-0.12.\nUsing this luminosity function and assuming pure luminosity evolution of the\nform\n  (1+z)^{3.3} we estimate a contribution to the X-ray background from `normal'\ngalaxies of 10-20 per cent (0.5-8 keV).

    "summary": "The future evolution of the universe suggested by the cosmological model\nproposed earlier at this meeting by the authors is explored. The fundamental\nrole played by the positive \"cosmological constant\" is emphasized. Dyson's 1979\npaper entitled \"Time Without End\" is briefly reviewed. His most optimistic\nscenario requires that the universe be geometrically open and that biology is\nstructural in the sense that the current complexity of human society can be\nreproduced by scaling up its (quantum mechanical) structure to arbitrary size.\nIf the recently measured \"cosmological constant\" is indeed a fundamental\nconstant of nature, then Dyson's scenario is, for various reasons, ruled out by\nthe finite (De Sitter) horizon due to exponential expansion of the resulting\nspace. However, the finite temperature of that horizon does open other\ninteresting options. If, as is suggested by the cosmology under consideration,\nthe current exponential expansion of the universe is due to a phase transition\nwhich fixes a physical boundary condition during the early radiation dominated\nera, the behavior of the universe after the relevant scale factor crosses the\nDe Sitter radius opens up still other possibilities. The relevance of Martin\nRees' apocalyptic eschatology recently presented in his book \"Our Final Hour\"\nis mentioned. It is concluded that even for the far future, whether or not\ncultural and scientific descendants of the current epoch will play a role in\nit, an understanding (sadly, currently lacking) of community and political\nevolution and control is essential for a preliminary treatment of what could be\neven vaguely called scientific eschatology.",

A\ntime-of-flight detector based on multi-gap resistive plate chamber (MRPC)\ntechnology is used for particle identification. The intrinsic timing resolution\n85 ps was achieved after the calibration. We observe that the spectra of\n$\\pi^{\\pm}$, $K^{\\pm}$, $p$ and $\\bar{p}$ are considerably harder in d+Au than\nthose in p+p collisions. In $\\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}} = 200$ GeV d+Au collisions, the\nnuclear modification factor $R_{dAu}$ of protons rise faster than those of\npions and kaons. Besides, the particle-species dependence of the Cronin effect\nis observed to be significantly smaller than that at lower energies. The ratio\nof the nuclear modification factor ($R_{dAu}$) between $(p+\\bar{p})$ and\ncharged hadrons ($h$) in the transverse momentum range $1.2<p_{T}<3.0$ GeV/c is\nmeasured to be $1.19\\pm0.05$(stat)$\\pm0.03$(syst) in minimum-bias collisions\nand shows little centrality dependence. The yield ratio of $(p+\\bar{p})/h$ in\nminimum-bias d+Au collisions is found to be a factor of 2 lower than that in\nAu+Au collisions, indicating that the relative baryon enhancement observed in\nheavy ion collisions at RHIC is due to the final state effects in Au+Au\ncollisions. The mechanism for Cronin effect is also discussed in this thesis by\ncomparison with the recombination model and with the initial multiple parton\nscattering model. From the comparisons, we conclude that the Cronin effect in\n200 GeV d+Au collisions is not initial state effect only, and that final state\neffect plays an important role.",

Considering\nthe case in which the energy-momentum tensor of ordinary matter stays\nindividually conserved, we show from the holographic dark energy requirement\nthat the RG laws for the CC and G_N are completely determined in terms of the\nlowest part of the particle spectrum of an underlying QFT. From simple\narguments one can then infer that the lowest-mass fields should have a Compton\nwavelength comparable with the size of the current Hubble horizon. Hence,\nalthough the models with the variable CC (or with both the CC and the G_N\nvarying) are known tolead to successful cosmologies without introducing a new\nlight degree of freedom, we nonetheless find that holography actually brings us\nback to the quintessence proposal.

    "summary": "The structural properties resulting from the reciprocal influence between\nwater and three well-known homologous disaccharides, namely trehalose, maltose\nand sucrose, in aqueous solutions have been investigated in the 4-66 wt %\nconcentration range by means of molecular dynamics computer simulations.\nHydration numbers clearly show that trehalose binds to a larger number of water\nmolecules than do maltose or sucrose, thus affecting the water structure to a\ndeeper extent. Two-dimensional radial distribution functions of trehalose\ndefinitely reveal that water is preferentially localized at the hydration sites\nfound in the dihydrate crystal, this tendency being enhanced when increasing\ntrehalose concentration. In a rather wide concentration range (4-49 wt %), the\nfluctuations of the radius of gyration and of the glycosidic dihedral angles of\ntrehalose indicate a higher flexibility with respect to maltose and sucrose. At\nsugar concentrations between 33 wt % and 66 wt %, the mean sugar cluster size\nand the number of sugar-sugar hydrogen bonds (HBs) formed within sugar clusters\nreveal that trehalose is able to form larger clusters than sucrose but smaller\nthan maltose. These features suggest that trehalose-water mixtures would be\nmore homogeneous than the two others, thus reducing both desiccation stresses\nand ice formation.",

A depth of 1270 m separates\nan upper region of uniform thickness of stress modified areas, possibly\ncorresponding to a shear domain, and a lower region where there are\nsimultaneously two values of the thicknesses of the stress modified areas\n(particularly between 1500 and 1600 m of depth) possibly corresponding to a\ncompressive and a shear domain. In order to integrate the contradictory effects\nof the simultaneity of shear and compressive domains at some depths, as well as\nthe presence of three shear zones at particular depths, we propose that the San\nAndreas Fault could be bayonet-shaped instead of planar. Other recent available\ninformation in the literature about this fault, such as the presence of a fault\nzone of low shear wave velocity, stress rotation measured with depth, and the\nlarge angles of the frictional coefficients, can be logically explained by this\nkind of fault geometry.",

At 30 C, the intensity of\ncollapse was increased by slower drying. It was considered that: 1) slower\ndrying resulted in higher sample temperature in the early stage of drying to\nincrease the collapse; 2) rapid drying stiffened the surface of sample and such\n\"shell\" prohibited the following collapse; 3) slower drying i.e. longer loading\nof liquid tension caused more remarkable and/or frequent viscoelastic yields of\ncells. Consequently the intensity of collapse increased when the cane was dried\nfrom its waxy outer surface or in the presence of node: both of them retarded\nthe drying. On the other hand, higher drying temperature caused greater\nintensity of collapse in spite of faster drying. It was suggested that the\nthermal softening of cane cells leads to easier yield of the cell wall, at the\nsame time the rapid drying does not allow the recovery of collapse after the\ndisappearance of free water. These results indicated that faster drying at\nlower temperature is preferable for drying cane with less collapse.",

The processes of freeze--out on to the dust\ngrains and coagulation of the grains were treated simultaneously with the\nchemical evolution of the medium.When proceeding at close to its maximum rate,\ncoagulation has important consequences for the degree of ionization and the\nionic composition of the medium, but its effect on the freeze--out of the\nneutral species is modest.An innovation of our study is to calculate the grain\ncharge distribution which is significant because H+ ions recombine on the\nsurfaces of negatively charged grains. We also consider the observational\nresult that N-containing species, such as NH3 and N2H+,remain in the gas phase\nat densities for which CO and other C--containing molecules appear to have\nfrozen on to grain surfaces. We conclude that recent measurements of the\nadsorption energies of N2 and CO invalidate the interpretation of these\nobservations in terms of the relative volatilities of N2 and CO. We consider an\nalternative explanation,in terms of low sticking coefficients for either\nmolecular or atomic N. We find that, irrespective of the nitrogen chemistry,the\nmain gas phase ion is either H+ or H3+ (and its deuterated isotopes) at\ndensities above 10^5; whether H+ or H3+ predominates depends sensitively on the\nrate of increase in grain size (decrease in grain surface area per unit volume\nof gas) during core contraction.Our calculations show that H+ will predominate\nif grain coagulation proceeds at close to its maximum rate, and H3+ otherwise.",

Such a market was run, with\nabout 400 registered traders, during the U.S. presidential election in November\n2004 and Taiwan parliamentary election in December 2004. The experiments\nrecorded transaction price, highest bid, lowest ask, and trading volume of each\ncontract as a function of time. Despite the relatively small scale of the\nexchange, in terms of the number of participants and duration of the\ntournament, we report evidence for asymptotic power-law behaviors of the\ndistributions of price returns, trading volumes, inter-transaction time\nintervals, and accumulated wealth that were found universal in real financial\nmarkets.",

A remarkable property is their\nrenormalizability, since these approximations involve selective summations to\ninfinite perturbative orders. In this paper we show how to renormalize all\n$n$-point functions of the theory, which are given by derivatives of the\n2PI-resummed effective action $\\Gamma[\\phi]$ for scalar fields $\\phi$. This\nprovides a complete description in terms of the generating functional for\nrenormalized proper vertices, which extends previous prescriptions in the\nliterature on the renormalization for 2PI effective actions. The importance of\nthe 2PI-resummed generating functional for proper vertices stems from the fact\nthat the latter respect all symmetry properties of the theory and, in\nparticular, Goldstone's theorem in the phase with spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking. This is important in view of the application of these techniques to\ngauge theories, where Ward identities play a crucial role.",

Advection of particle\ndensities due to the hydrodynamic flow field is also included. The radiative\ntransfer is treated frequency-independently, i.e. grey, so far. The upgraded\ncode has been applied to two-dimensional simulations of carbon monoxide (CO) in\nthe non-magnetic solar photosphere and low chromosphere. For this purpose a\nreaction network has been constructed, taking into account the reactions which\nare most important for the formation and dissociation of CO under the physical\nconditions of the solar atmosphere. The network has been strongly reduced to 27\nreactions, involving the chemical species H, H2, C, O, CO, CH, OH, and a\nrepresentative metal. The resulting CO number density is highest in the cool\nregions of the reversed granulation pattern at mid-photospheric heights and\ndecreases strongly above. There, the CO abundance stays close to a value of 8.3\non the usual logarithmic abundance scale with [H]=12 but is reduced in hot\nshock waves which are a ubiquitous phenomenon of the model atmosphere. For\ncomparison, the corresponding equilibrium densities have been calculated, based\non the reaction network but also under assumption of instantaneous chemical\nequilibrium by applying the Rybicki & Hummer (RH) code by Uitenbroek (2001).\nOwing to the short chemical timescales, the assumption holds for a large\nfraction of the atmosphere, in particular the photosphere. In contrast, the CO\nnumber density deviates strongly from the corresponding equilibrium value in\nthe vicinity of chromospheric shock waves. Simulations with altered reaction\nnetwork clearly show that the formation channel via hydroxide (OH) is the most\nimportant one under the conditions of the solar atmosphere.",

We find that the XLF from the local sample of\nIRAS galaxies (Takeuchi et al) provides a good representation of all available\ndata samples; pure luminosity evolution of the form (1+z)^\\eta, with \\eta< ~3,\nis favoured over pure density. The local X-ray luminosity density is also well\ndefined. We discuss different estimates of the galaxies LogN-LogS, selected\nfrom the Chandra Deep Fields with different selection criteria: these have\nsimilar slopes, but normalisations scattered within a factor ~2, of the same\norder of the Poissonian error on the counts. We compare the observed LogN-LogS\nwith the counts predicted by integrating our reference z=0 XLF. By using number\ncounts alone, it is not possible to discriminate between density and luminosity\nevolution; however, the evolution of galaxies must be stopped in both cases at\nz~1-2. The contribution of galaxies to the X-ray background is found to be in\nthe range 6%--12%. Making use of cosmic star formation models, we find that the\nX-ray LogN-LogS might be not compatible with very large star formation rates at\nz ~ 3 as suggested by sub-mm observations in Blain et al. 1999. As to the\ncontent of current and, possibly, future X-ray surveys, we determine the\nfraction of galaxies around the current flux limit: (30+-12 %). At fainter\nfluxes the fraction of galaxies will probably rise, and overcome the counts\nfrom AGN at fluxes < ~10^{-17} erg/s/cm^2.",

    "summary": "Brane inflation in superstring theory ends when branes collide, initiating\nthe hot big bang. Cosmic superstrings are produced during the brane collision.\nThe cosmic superstrings produced in a D3-brane-antibrane inflationary scenario\nhave a spectrum: $(p,q)$ bound states of $p$ fundamental (F) strings and $q$\nD-strings, where $p$ and $q$ are coprime. By extending the velocity-dependent\none-scale network evolution equations for abelian Higgs cosmic strings to allow\na spectrum of string tensions, we construct a coupled (infinite) set of\nequations for strings that interact through binding and self-interactions. We\napply this model to a network of $(p,q)$ superstrings. Our numerical solutions\nshow that $(p,q)$ networks rapidly approach a stable scaling solution. We also\nextract the relative densities of each string type from our solutions.\nTypically, only a small number of the lowest tension states are populated\nsubstantially once scaling is reached. The model we study also has an\ninteresting new feature: the energy released in $(p,q)$ string binding is by\nitself adequate to allow the network to reach scaling. This result suggests\nthat the scaling solution is robust. To demonstrate that this result is not\ntrivial, we show that choosing a different form for string interactions can\nlead to network frustration.",

In so doing the perturbative time-like\ndiscontinuity is preserved and nonperturbative contributions not only remove\nthe nonphysical singularities of the perturbation theory in the infrared region\nbut also decrease rapidly in the ultraviolet region. In the framework of the\napproach, on the one hand, the running coupling is enhanced at zero and, on the\nother hand, the dynamical gluon mass m_g arises. Fixing the parameter which\ncharacterize the infrared enhancement corresponding to the string tension\n\\sigma and normalization, say, at M_\\tau completely define the synthetic\nrunning coupling. In this case the dynamical gluon mass appears to be fixed and\nthe higher loop stabilization property of m_g is observed.

    "summary": "Recent new high-precision abundance data for Galactic halo stars suggest\nimportant primary nitrogen production in very metal-poor massive stars. Here,\nwe compute a new model for the chemical evolution of the Milky Way aimed at\nexplaining these new abundance data. The new data can be explained by adopting:\na) the stellar yields obtained from stellar models that take into account\nrotation and b) an extra production of nitrogen in the very metal-poor massive\nstars. In particular, we suggest an increase of nearly a factor of 200 in 14N\nfor a star of 60 Msun and 40 for a star of 9Msun, for metallicities below\nZ=10$^{-5}$, with respect to the yields given in the literature for Z=10$^{-5}$\nand rotational velocity of 300 km/s. We show that once we adopt the above\nprescriptions, our model is able to predict high N/O abundance ratios at low\nmetallicities and still explains the nitrogen abundances observed in thin disk\nstars in the solar vicinity. The physical motivation for a larger nitrogen\nproduction in massive stars in very metal-poor environments could be the fact\nthat some stellar models as well as observational data suggest that at low\nmetallicities stars rotate faster. If this is the case, such large nitrogen\nproduction seen in the pristine phases of the halo formation would not\nnecessarily happen in Damped Lyman-alpha systems which have metallicities\nalways above [Fe/H]$\\simeq -$2.5, and could have been pre-enriched. We also\ncompute the abundance gradient of N/O along the Galactic disk and show that a\nnegative gradient is predicted once we adopt stellar yields where rotation is\ntaken into account. The latter result implies that intermediate mass stars\ncontribute less to the primary nitrogen than previously thought.",

Ours is one of the very few known non-linear invariance principles. It\nhas the advantage that its proof is simple and that the error bounds are\nexplicit.

These\nmodels are based on the notion of preferential attachment leading to the ``rich\nget richer'' phenomenon. Despite the generality of the proposed stochastic\nmodels, there are still some unexplained phenomena, which may arise due to the\nlimited size of networks such as protein, e-mail, actor and collaboration\nnetworks. Such networks may in fact exhibit an exponential cutoff in the\npower-law scaling, although this cutoff may only be observable in the tail of\nthe distribution for extremely large networks. We propose a modification of the\nbasic stochastic evolutionary model, so that after a node is chosen\npreferentially, say according to the number of its inlinks, there is a small\nprobability that this node will become inactive. We show that as a result of\nthis modification, by viewing the stochastic process in terms of an urn\ntransfer model, we obtain a power-law distribution with an exponential cutoff.\nUnlike many other models, the current model can capture instances where the\nexponent of the distribution is less than or equal to two. As a proof of\nconcept, we demonstrate the consistency of our model empirically by analysing\nthe Mathematical Research collaboration network, the distribution of which is\nknown to follow a power law with an exponential cutoff.",

We perform compositional fits of the spectra\nbased on properties of homogeneous as well as inhomogeneous spherical\nparticles, and derive the mineralogy and typical grain sizes of the dust\nresponsible for the 10 $\\mu$m emission. Several trends are reported that can\nconstrain theoretical models of dust processing in these systems: i) none of\nthe sources consists of fully pristine dust comparable to that found in the\ninterstellar medium, ii) all sources with a high fraction of crystalline\nsilicates are dominated by large grains, iii) the disks around more massive\nstars (M >~ 2.5 M_sun, L >~ 60 L_sun) have a higher fraction of crystalline\nsilicates than those around lower mass stars, iv) in the subset of lower mass\nstars (M <~ 2.5 M_sun) there is no correlation between stellar parameters and\nthe derived crystallinity of the dust. The correlation between the shape and\nstrength of the 10 micron silicate feature reported by van Boekel et al. (2003)\nis reconfirmed with this larger sample. The evidence presented in this paper is\ncombined with that of other studies to present a likely scenario of dust\nprocessing in Herbig Ae systems. We conclude that the present data favour a\nscenario in which the crystalline silicates are produced in the innermost\nregions of the disk, close to the star, and transported outward to the regions\nwhere they can be detected by means of 10 micron spectroscopy. Additionally, we\nconclude that the final crystallinity of these disks is reached very soon after\nactive accretion has stopped.",

These optical, non-imaging detectors generally contain a\n\"fiducial volume\" from which data are accepted, and an \"active buffer region\"\nwhere there are higher levels of radioactive contaminants. Events are observed\nin real time. To distinguish between events occurring in the two regions, it is\nimperative that event position reconstruction be well-understood. The object of\nthis paper is the study of the reconstruction, in time and space, of\nscintillation events in detectors of large dimensions. A general,\nlikelihood-based method of position reconstruction for this class of detectors\nis presented. The potential spatial resolution of the method is then evaluated.\nIt is shown that for a spherical detector with a large number N of\nphotosensitive elements that detect photons, the expected spatial resolution at\nthe center of the detector is given by delta a ~ (c sigma / n) sqrt(3/N), where\nsigma is the width of the scintillator time response function and n is the\nindex of refraction in the medium. However, if light in the detector has a\nscattering mean free path much less than the detector radius R, the resolution\ninstead becomes (R/2) sqrt(3/N).

    "summary": "The explosion that results in a cosmic gamma-ray burst (GRB) is thought to\nproduce emission from two physical processes -- the activity of the central\nengine gives rise to the high-energy emission of the burst through internal\nshocking and the subsequent interaction of the flow with the external\nenvironment produces long-wavelength afterglow. While afterglow observations\ncontinue to refine our understanding of GRB progenitors and relativistic\nshocks, gamma-ray observations alone have not yielded a clear picture of the\norigin of the prompt emission nor details of the central engine. Only one\nconcurrent visible-light transient has been found and was associated with\nemission from an external shock. Here we report the discovery of infrared (IR)\nemission contemporaneous with a GRB, beginning 7.2 minutes after the onset of\nGRB 041219a. Our robotic telescope acquired 21 images during the active phase\nof the burst, yielding the earliest multi-colour observations of any\nlong-wavelength emission associated with a GRB. Analysis of an initial IR pulse\nsuggests an origin consistent with internal shocks. This opens a new\npossibility to study the central engine of GRBs with ground-based observations\nat long wavelengths.",

In particular, we focus on a supermassive\nblack hole formation scenario in which the present-day population of\nsupermassive black holes is built from high-mass seed black holes and we\ncompute the concomitant spectrum of gravitational radiation produced by mergers\nof the seed black holes. We find that this scenario predicts a large,\ngravitational wave background that should be resolved into individual sources\nwith space interferometers such as the proposed Laser Interferometric Space\nAntenna (LISA). The number of inspiral, merger and ringdown events above a\nsignal to noise ratio of 5 that result from massive black hole seeds is of\norder 10^3. This prediction is robust and insensitive to several of the details\nof the model. We conclude that an interferometer such as LISA will be able to\neffectively rule out or confirm a class of models where supermassive black\nholes grow from high-mass seed black holes and may be able to place strong\nlimits on the role of mergers as a channel for supermassive black hole growth.\nSupermassive black hole seeds likely form in the earliest proto-galactic\nstructures at high redshift and the masses of supermassive black holes are\nknown to be strongly correlated with the potentials of the spheroids in which\nthey reside, therefore these results imply that space interferometers can be\nused as a powerful probe of the physics of galaxy formation and proto-galaxy\nformation at very high redshift.",

The projected number density profile of\nthis dwarf population deviates within ~1/3 of the virial radius from a\nprojected NFW-profile, which is assumed to approximate the underlying total\nmatter distribution. By means of a semi-analytic model we demonstrate that the\ninterplay between gravitation, dynamical friction and tidal mass loss and\ndestruction can explain the observed number density profile. We use only two\nparameters in our models: the total to stellar mass fraction of the satellite\nhalos and the disruption efficiency. The disruption efficiency is expressed by\na minimum radius. If the tidal radius of the galaxy (halo) falls below this\nradius the galaxies is assumed to become unobservable. The preferred parameters\nare an initial total to stellar mass fraction of ~20 and a disruption radius of\n4 kpc. In that model about 20% of all the satellites are totally disrupted on\ntheir orbits within the group environment. Dynamical friction is less important\nin shaping the inner slope of the number density profile since the reduction in\nmass by tidal forces lowers the impact of the friction term. The main\ndestruction mechanism is tide. In the preferred model the total B-band\nluminosity of all the disrupted galaxies is about twice the observed luminosity\nof the central elliptical galaxy, indicating that a significant fraction of\nstars are scattered into the intragroup medium.(Abridged)",

Compared to\nprevious 1D or 2D models that assume a purely radial radiation force, we seek\nadditionally to treat the lateral momentum and transport of diffuse\nline-radiation, initially here within a 2D context. A key incentive is to study\nthe damping effect of the associated diffuse line-drag on the dynamical\nproperties of the flow, focusing particularly on whether this might prevent\nlateral break-up of shell structures at scales near the lateral Sobolev angle\nof ca. $1^{\\rm o}$. We first explore nonlinear simulations that cast the\nlateral diffuse force in the simple, local form of a parallel viscosity.\nSecond, to account for the lateral mixing of radiation associated with the\nradial driving, we next explore models in which the radial force is azimuthally\nsmoothed over a chosen scale. Third, to account for both the lateral line-drag\nand the lateral mixing in a more self-consistent way, we explore further a\nmethod first proposed by Owocki (1999), which uses a restricted 3-ray approach\nthat combines a radial ray with two oblique rays set to have an impact\nparameter $p < R_{\\ast}$ within the stellar core. From numerical simulations,\nwe find that, compared to equivalent 1-ray simulations, the high-resolution\n3-ray models show systematically a much higher lateral coherence....

    "summary": "We present some new ideas about the possibility of life developing around\nsub-giant and red giant stars. Our study concerns the temporal evolution of the\nhabitable zone. The distance between the star and the habitable zone, as well\nas its width, increases with time as a consequence of stellar evolution. The\nhabitable zone moves outward after the star leaves the main sequence, sweeping\na wider range of distances from the star until the star reaches the tip of the\nasymptotic giant branch. If life could form and evolve over time intervals from\n$5 \\times 10^8$ to $10^9$ years, then there could be habitable planets with\nlife around red giant stars. For a 1 M$_{\\odot}$ star at the first stages of\nits post main-sequence evolution, the temporal transit of the habitable zone is\nestimated to be of several 10$^9$ years at 2 AU and around 10$^8$ years at 9\nAU. Under these circumstances life could develop at distances in the range 2-9\nAU in the environment of sub-giant or giant stars and in the far distant future\nin the environment of our own Solar System. After a star completes its first\nascent along the Red Giant Branch and the He flash takes place, there is an\nadditional stable period of quiescent He core burning during which there is\nanother opportunity for life to develop. For a 1 M$_{\\odot}$ star there is an\nadditional $10^9$ years with a stable habitable zone in the region from 7 to 22\nAU. Space astronomy missions, such as proposed for the Terrestrial Planet\nFinder (TPF) and Darwin should also consider the environments of sub-giants and\nred giant stars as potentially interesting sites for understanding the\ndevelopment of life.",

The generic detector can be\nparticularized to the matched filter, decorrelator, linear MMSE detector, the\njointly or the individually optimal detector, and others. It is found that the\ndetection output for each user, although in general asymptotically non-Gaussian\nconditioned on the transmitted symbol, converges as the number of users go to\ninfinity to a deterministic function of a \"hidden\" Gaussian statistic\nindependent of the interferers. Thus the multiuser channel can be decoupled:\nEach user experiences an equivalent single-user Gaussian channel, whose\nsignal-to-noise ratio suffers a degradation due to the multiple-access\ninterference. The uncoded error performance (e.g., symbol-error-rate) and the\nmutual information can then be fully characterized using the degradation\nfactor, also known as the multiuser efficiency, which can be obtained by\nsolving a pair of coupled fixed-point equations identified in this paper.

By contrast, establishing minimum-cost static multicast\nconnections over routed packet networks is a very difficult problem even using\ncentralized computation, except in the special cases of unicast and broadcast\nconnections.\n  For dynamic multicast, we reduce the problem to a dynamic programming problem\nand apply the theory of dynamic programming to suggest how it may be solved.",

The diffusion control problem does not seem to have explicit\nsolutions and therefore a characterization of optimal solutions via the\nHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation is addressed. Our main result is the existence\nand uniqueness of solutions of the equation. Since the model is set on an\nunbounded domain and the cost per unit time is unbounded, the analysis requires\nestimates on the state process that are subexponential in the time variable. In\nestablishing these estimates, a key role is played by an integral formula that\nrelates queue length and idle time processes, which may be of independent\ninterest.",

The acoustic waves at the interface are due to compression of the gas\non one side of the flux tube and expansion on the other. These waves travel\nupward along the two sides of the (2D) flux tube and enter it, where they\nbecome longitudinal waves. For impulsive excitation with a time constant of 120\ns, we find that a dominant feature is the creation of vortical motions that\npropagate upward.

Under the limit, the magnetization moves along the steepest energy\ndescent path. The minimal switching field is the one at which there is only one\nstable fixed point in the system. 2) For a given magnetic anisotropy, there is\na critical value for the damping constant, above which the minimal switching\nfield is the same as that of the SW-limit. 3) We illustrate how fixed points\nand their basins change under a field along different directions. This change\nexplains well why a non-parallel field gives a smaller minimal switching field\nand a short switching time. 4) The field of a ballistic magnetization reversal\nshould be along certain direction window in the presence of energy dissipation.\nThe width of the window depends on both of the damping constant and the\nmagnetic anisotropy. The upper and lower bounds of the direction window\nincrease with the damping constant. The window width oscillates with the\ndamping constant for a given magnetic anisotropy. It is zero for both zero and\ninfinite damping. Thus, the perpendicular field configuration widely employed\nin the current experiments is not the best one since the damping constant in a\nreal system is far from zero.",

This was supplemented by a\nsimultaneous observation with the Proportional Counter Array (PCA) of the Rossi\nX-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). During this observation, the source was in a\nsomewhat low intensity state and the pulse profile with both Chandra and RXTE\nshows a narrow dip, characteristic of GX 1+4 in medium and low intensity\nstates. The continuum X-ray spectrum obtained with the HETG and PCA can be\nfitted well with a high energy cutoff power-law model with line of sight\nabsorption. Interestingly, we find that this low state is accompanied by a\nrelatively small absorption column density. A 6.4 keV narrow emission line with\nan equivalent width of 70 eV is clearly detected in the HETG spectrum. The\nfluorescence iron line, or at least part of it is produced in the neutral or\nlowly ionized iron in the circumstellar material that also causes most of the\nline of sight absorption. In the HETG spectrum, we have found evidence for a\nweak (equivalent width ~30 eV) emission line at 6.95 keV. This line is\nidentified as Ly_alpha emission line from hydrogen-like iron and the spectrum\ndoes not show emission lines from helium-like iron. We discuss various emission\nregions for the hydrogen-like iron emission line, like gas diffused into the\nAlfven sphere or an accretion curtain flowing from the inner accretion disk to\nthe magnetic poles.",

A star\nmust be sufficiently magnified, that is, the lens impact parameter must be less\nthan a threshold value $u_T$ if the excess photon flux in a pixel is to be\ndetected over the background. Assuming the parameters of the Isaac Newton\nTelescope and typical observing conditions, we present maps in the sky plane\ntowards M31 of threshold impact parameter, optical depth, event number and\nevent time scale, analyzing in particular how these quantities depend on $u_T$\nin pixel lensing searches. We use an analytical approach consisting of\naveraging on $u_T$ and the star column density the optical depth, microlensing\nrate and event duration time scale. An overall decrease in the expected optical\ndepth and event number with respect to the classical microlensing results is\nfound, particularly towards the high luminosity M31 inner regions. As expected,\npixel lensing events towards the inner region of M31 are mostly due to\nself-lensing, while in the outer region dark events dominate even for a 20%\nMACHO halo fraction. We also find a far-disk/near-disk asymmetry in the\nexpected event number, smaller than that found by \\cite{Kerins04}. Both for\nself and dark lensing events, the pixel lensing time scale we obtain is $\\simeq\n1 - 7$ days, dark events lasting roughly twice as long as self-lensing events.\nThe shortest events are found to occur towards the M31 South Semisphere. We\nalso note that the pixel lensing results depend on $<u_T>$ and $<u_T^{~2}>$\nvalues and ultimately on the observing conditions and telescope capabilities.",

However, a disadvantage\nof this approach is that it requires the capacity requested by individual\nrequests to be sufficiently small compared to total available capacity. We\nfirst solve a related deterministic linear program (LP) and then translate an\noptimal solution of the LP into an admission control policy for the loss\nnetwork via an exponential penalty function. We show that the penalty policy is\na target-tracking policy--it performs well because the optimal solution of the\nLP is a good target.

In this sense, one of the most promising candidates is\nrepresented by supersymmetric neutralinos. If they exist, they give rise to\nrelic densities in the required range, and are very well motivated in the\nframework of theoretical extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics.\nIn addition to direct neutralino searches and collider experiments, neutralino\nannihilation into gamma rays, neutrinos and synchrotron emission from the\ncharged products represents a reliable way of detecting these intriguing\nparticles. The strongest signals are expected to come from the Galactic Center\nand from the nearest dwarf spheroidals. Clumps of dark matter in galactic\nhaloes are well predicted by high resolution cold dark matter numerical\nsimulations. In this work we present our studies on the gamma-ray emission from\nthe Galactic Center and from the Draco dwarf spheroidal.

When f satisfies certain pointwise conditions (e.g., f is bounded from\nbelow), the super replication price is equal to sup_QE_Q[f], where Q varies on\nthe whole set of pricing measures. Unfortunately, this price is often too high:\na typical situation is here discussed in the examples. We thus define the less\nexpensive weak super replication price and we relax the requirements on f by\nasking just for ``enough'' integrability conditions. By building up a proper\nduality theory, we show its economic meaning and its relation with the\ninvestor's preferences. Indeed, it turns out that the weak super replication\nprice of f coincides with sup_{Q\\in M_{\\Phi}}E_Q[f], where M_{\\Phi} is the\nclass of pricing measures with finite generalized entropy (i.e., E[\\Phi\n(\\frac{dQ}{dP})]<\\infty) and where \\Phi is the convex conjugate of the utility\nfunction of the investor.",

We show that the decay rates for the finite\ntruncations converge to a value, which is not necessarily the decay rate in the\ninfinite waiting room case.

Six nearby main-sequence G stars with ages between ~0.1 Gyr and\n\\~1.6 Gyr and rotation periods between ~1d and 12.4d have been observed. We\nderive coronal element abundances and the coronal emission measure distribution\n(EMD). The abundances change from an inverse-First Ionization Potential (FIP)\ndistribution in stars with ages around 0.1 Gyr to a solar-type FIP distribution\nin stars at ages of 0.3 Gyr and beyond. The coronal EMDs show shapes\ncharacterized by power-laws on each side of the EMD peak. The latter shifts\nfrom temperatures of about 10 MK in the most rapidly rotating, young stars to\ntemperatures around 4 MK in the oldest target considered here. The power-law\nindex on the cooler side of the EMD exceeds expected slopes for static loops,\nwith typical values being 1.5-3. We interpret this slope with a model in which\nthe coronal emission is due to a superposition of stochastically occurring\nflares, with an occurrence rate that is distributed in radiated energy E as a\npower-law, dN/dE ~ E^-a. Our EMDs indicate a ~ 2.2-2.8, in excellent agreement\nwith values previously derived from light curves of magnetically active stars.\nWe derive the range of flare energies required to explain the light-curve\nmodulation. In an overall scenario, we propose that flaring activity plays a\nlarger role in more active stars. In this model, the higher flare rate is\nresponsible both for the higher average coronal temperature and the high\ncoronal X-ray luminosity, two parameters that are indeed found to be\ncorrelated.",

    "summary": "We have studied the origin of switching (telegraph) noise at low temperature\nin lateral quantum structures defined electrostatically in GaAs/AlGaAs\nheterostructures by surface gates. The noise was measured by monitoring the\nconductance fluctuations around $e^2/h$ on the first step of a quantum point\ncontact at around 1.2 K. Cooling with a positive bias on the gates dramatically\nreduces this noise, while an asymmetric bias exacerbates it. We propose a model\nin which the noise originates from a leakage current of electrons that tunnel\nthrough the Schottky barrier under the gate into the doped layer. The key to\nreducing noise is to keep this barrier opaque under experimental conditions.\nBias cooling reduces the density of ionized donors, which builds in an\neffective negative gate voltage. A smaller negative bias is therefore needed to\nreach the desired operating point. This suppresses tunnelling from the gate and\nhence the noise. The reduction in the density of ionized donors also\nstrengthens the barrier to tunneling at a given applied voltage. Support for\nthe model comes from our direct observation of the leakage current into a\nclosed quantum dot, around $10^{-20} \\mathrm{A}$ for this device. The current\nwas detected by a neighboring quantum point contact, which showed monotonic\nsteps in time associated with the tunneling of single electrons into the dot.\nIf asymmetric gate voltages are applied, our model suggests that the noise will\nincrease as a consequence of the more negative gate voltage applied to one of\nthe gates to maintain the same device conductance. We observe exactly this\nbehaviour in our experiments.",

To interpret the data, we also investigate the\nformation of molecules and especially CO and water vapor in the inner hot and\ndense part of disks around young high mass stars using a pseudo time-dependent\ngas-phase chemical model. Molecules are rapidly photodissociated but this\ndestruction is compensated by an efficient formation due to fast\nneutral-neutral reactions. The ability of CO molecules to self-shield\nsignificantly enhances its abundance. Water molecules are sufficiently abundant\nto be detectable. The observed H2O/CO ratio is reproduced by gas at 1600K and\nan enhanced UV field over gas density ratio I_UV/nH=1E(-4)- 1E(-6).

With the help of a scalar-Yukawa\nmodel, we show that this apparent instability is due to the extrapolation of\nthe potential into a region where it is no longer valid. Stability turns out to\nbe an intrinsic property of the theory (rather than an additional constraint to\nbe imposed on it). However, lower bounds for the Higgs mass can still be\nderived with the help of a criterium dictated by the properties of the\npotential itself. If the scale of new physics lies in the Tev region, sizeable\ndifferences with the usual bounds are found. Finally, our results exclude the\nalternative meta-stability scenario, according to which we might be living in a\nsufficiently long lived meta-stable EW vacuum.",

We consider solutions that include a self-accelerating univese,\nwhere the accelerating expansion of the universe is realized without\nintroducing a cosmological constant on the brane. The mass of the discrete mode\nfor the spin-2 graviton is calculated for various $Hr_c$, where $H$ is the\nHubble parameter and $r_c$ is the cross-over scale determined by the ratio\nbetween the 5D Newton constant and the 4D Newton constant. We show that, if we\nintroduce a positive cosmological constant on the brane ($Hr_c >1$), the spin-2\ngraviton has mass in the range $0 < m^2 < 2H^2$ and there is a normalisable\nbrane fluctuation mode with mass $m^2=2 H^2$. Although the brane fluctuation\nmode is healthy, the spin-2 graviton has a helicity-0 excitation that is a\nghost. If we allow a negative cosmological constant on the brane, the brane\nbending mode becomes a ghost for $1/2 < Hr_c <1$. This confirms the results\nobtained by the boundary effective action that there exists a scalar ghost mode\nfor $Hr_c >1/2$. In a self-accelerating universe $Hr_c=1$, the spin-2 graviton\nhas mass $m^2=2H^2$, which is known to be a special case for massive gravitons\nin de Sitter spacetime where the graviton has no helicity-0 excitation and so\nno ghost. However, in DGP model, there exists a brane fluctuation mode with the\nsame mass and there arises a mixing between the brane fluctuation mode and the\nspin-2 graviton. We argue that this mixing presumably gives a ghost in the\nself-accelerating universe by continuity across $Hr_c=1$, although a careful\ncalculation of the effective action is required to verify this rigorously.",

With the goal of going beyond the leading order in\nthe 't Hooft expansion we derive the analog of the Bethe equations on the\nstring-theory side, and show that they coincide with the thermodynamic limit of\nthe Bethe equations for the spin chain.

    "summary": "Microcanonical thermodynamics allows the application of statistical mechanics\nboth to finite and even small systems and also to the largest, self-gravitating\nones. However, one must reconsider the fundamental principles of statistical\nmechanics especially its key quantity, entropy. Whereas in conventional\nthermostatistics, the homogeneity and extensivity of the system and the\nconcavity of its entropy are central conditions, these fail for the systems\nconsidered here. For example, at phase separation, the entropy, S(E), is\nnecessarily convex to make exp[S(E)-E/T] bimodal in E. Particularly, as\ninhomogeneities and surface effects cannot be scaled away, one must be careful\nwith the standard arguments of splitting a system into two subsystems, or\nbringing two systems into thermal contact with energy or particle exchange. Not\nonly the volume part of the entropy must be considered. As will be shown here,\nwhen removing constraints in regions of a negative heat capacity, the system\nmay even relax under a flow of heat (energy) against a temperature slope. Thus\nthe Clausius formulation of the second law: ``Heat always flows from hot to\ncold'', can be violated. Temperature is not a necessary or fundamental control\nparameter of thermostatistics. However, the second law is still satisfied and\nthe total Boltzmann entropy increases. In the final sections of this paper, the\ngeneral microscopic mechanism leading to condensation and to the convexity of\nthe microcanonical entropy at phase separation is sketched. Also the\nmicroscopic conditions for the existence (or non-existence) of a critical\nend-point of the phase-separation are discussed.

For atomic collisions our approach\napplies to the case of parabolic confinement and, with certain restrictions,\nalso to an anharmonic one. The coupling between the angular momentum phase\nshifts $\\delta_l$ of a spherically symmetric scattering potential $V(r)$ due to\nthe cylindrical confinement is analysed. Under these general conditions, a\nbroad range of scattering energies covering many transversal excitations is\nconsidered and changes to the bound states of $V(r)$ are derived.

This planet has an anomalously large radius (1.35 times\nthat of Jupiter), which may be the result of ongoing tidal dissipation, but\nthis explanation requires a non-zero orbital eccentricity (~0.03), maintained\nby interaction with a hypothetical second planet. Here we report detection of\ninfrared (24 micron) radiation from HD 209458b, by observing the decrement in\nflux during secondary eclipse, when the planet passes behind the star. The\nplanet's 24 micron flux is 55 +/- 10 micro-Jy (1 sigma), with a brightness\ntemperature of 1130 +/- 150 Kelvins, confirming the predicted heating by\nstellar irradiation.

Our\ncalculations of the dependence of the CN ignition mass, Mign, on Mdot and Mwd\nyields the recurrence times of these explosions. We show that the observed CNe\norbital period distribution is consistent with the interrupted magnetic braking\nevolutionary scenario, where at orbital periods Porb > 3 hr mass transfer is\ndriven by angular momentum loss via a wind from the companion star and at Porb\n< 3 hr by gravitational radiation. About 50% of CNe occur in binaries accreting\nat Mdot ~= 10^{-9} Msun/yr with Porb = 3-4 hr, with the remaining 50% split\nevenly between Porb longer (higher Mdot) and shorter (lower Mdot) than this.\nThis resolution of the relative contribution to the CN rate from different CVs\ntells us that 3(9)x10^5 CVs with WD mass 1.0(0.6)Msun are needed to produce one\nCN per year. Using the K-band specific CN rate measured in external galaxies,\nwe find a CV birthrate of 2(4)x10^{-4}/yr per 10^{10}Lsun,K, very similar to\nthe luminosity specific Type Ia supernova rate in elliptical galaxies.\nLikewise, we predict that there should be 60-180 CVs for every 10^6Lsun,K in an\nold stellar population, similar to the number of X-ray identified CVs in the\nglobular cluster 47 Tuc, showing no overabundance relative to the field.

First, we incorporate into CEM2k+GEM2 new evaluations\nof elementary cross sections based on the latest experimental data and also\nmake several improvements in the description of the de-excitation of nuclei\nremaining after the cascade stage of reactions induced by arbitrary\nprojectiles. Next, for photonuclear reactions we include in CEM2k+GEM2 a\nnormalization to evaluated experimental absorption cross sections based on the\nrecent systematics by Kossov. Then, we extend our high-energy code LAQGSM by\nadding the photonuclear mode which was ignored in all its previous versions,\nand add to it the photonuclear part from our improved CEM2k+GEM2. In this work\nwe present a short description of the photonuclear mode as incorporated into\nour codes, show several illustrative results, and point out some unresolved\nproblems.",

    "summary": "Recent studies of attacks on complex networks suggest that small initial\nbreakdowns can lead to global cascades of overload failures in communication,\neconomic trading, and supply-transportation systems, considering the defense\nmethods is very important to reduce the huge damage. The propagation of\nfailures depends on the flow dynamics such as packet routing of physical\nquantities and on the heterogeneous distribution of load or capacity in many\nrealistic networks which have topological properties of scale-free (SF) and\ndegree-degree correlations. We introduce a defense strategy based on emergent\nrewirings between neighbors of the attacked node, and investigate the size of\ncascade on SF networks with controllable correlations. We show the differences\nof damaged size for the types of correlations and the effective range of\ntolerance in the defense methods.

When only a heavy hole charge\ncurrent without any spin polarization is injected through one lead, under right\nchoice of lead voltages, one can get a pure heavy (light) hole spin current,\ncombined with a possible impure light (heavy) hole spin current from another\ntwo leads. The spin Hall coefficients of both heavy and light holes depend on\nthe Fermi energy, devise size and the disorder strength. It is also shown that\nthe spin Hall effect of two dimensional hole systems is much more robust than\nthat of electron systems with the Rashba spin-orbit coupling and the spin Hall\ncoefficients do not decrease with the system size but tend to some nonzero\nvalues when the disorder strength is smaller than some critical value.",

But we want to demonstrate, contrary to\nthe claims of GRA, that their beam-splitter experiment does not conclusively\nconfirm the particle behaviour of light, and hence does not confirm\nparticle-wave duality, nor, more generally, does it confirm complementarity.\nOur demonstration consists of providing a detailed model based on the Causal\nInterpretation of Quantum Fields (CIEM), which does not involve the particle\nconcept, of GRA's which-path experiment.

We also\nshow mass profiles of the baryonic components. We find that galaxy-galaxy\ninteractions can enrich the surrounding intergalatic medium with metals very\nefficiently up to distances of several 100 kpc. This enrichment can be\nexplained in terms of indirect processes like thermal driven galactic winds or\ndirect processes like 'kinetic' spreading of baryonic matter. In the case of\nequal mass mergers the direct -kinetic- redistribution of gaseous matter (after\n5 Gyr) is less efficient than the environmental enrichment of the same isolated\ngalaxies by a galactic wind. In the case of non-equal mass mergers however, the\ndirect -kinetic- process dominates the redistribution of gaseous matter.\nCompared to the isolated systems, the integrated star formation rates (ISFRs)\n($\\int_{t = 0 Gyr}^{t = 5 Gyr}\\textnormal{SFR(t)}dt$) in the modelled\ninteracting galaxies are in extreme cases a factor of 5 higher and on average a\nfactor of 2 higher in interacting galaxies. Co-rotating and counter-rotating\ninteractions do not show a common trend for the enhancement of the ISFRs\ndepending on the interaction being edge-on or face-on. The latter case shows an\nincrease of the ISFRs for the counter-rotating system of about 100%, whereas\nthe edge-on counter-rotating case results in a lower increase ($\\sim$ 10%).",

    "summary": "A specific class of gauge theories is geometrically described in terms of\nfermions. In particular, it is shown how the geometrical frame presented\nnaturally includes spontaneous symmetry breaking of Yang-Mills gauge theories\nwithout making use of a Higgs potential. In more physical terms, it is shown\nthat the Yukawa coupling of fermions, together with gravity, necessarily yields\na symmetry reduction provided the fermionic mass is considered as a globally\nwell-defined concept. The structure of this symmetry breaking is shown to be\ncompatible with the symmetry breaking that is induced by the Higgs potential of\nthe minimal Standard Model. As a consequence, it is shown that the fermionic\nmass has a simple geometrical interpretation in terms of curvature and that the\n(semi-classical)\"fermionic vacuum\" determines the intrinsic geometry of\nspace-time. We also discuss the issue of \"fermion doubling\" in some detail and\nintroduce a specific projection onto the \"physical sub-space\" that is motivated\nfrom the Standard Model.",

    "summary": "Recently, Bercovici has introduced multiplicative convolutions based on\nMuraki's monotone independence and shown that these convolution of probability\nmeasures correspond to the composition of some function of their Cauchy\ntransforms. We provide a new proof of this fact based on the combinatorics of\nmoments. We also give a new characterisation of the probability measures that\ncan be embedded into continuous monotone convolution semigroups of probability\nmeasures on the unit circle and briefly discuss a relation to Galton-Watson\nprocesses.",

This object was detected as an overdensity of red,\nresolved stars in Sloan Digital Sky Survey data. The color-magnitude diagram of\nthe Ursa Major dwarf looks remarkably similar to that of Sextans, the lowest\nsurface brightness Milky Way companion known, but with approximately an order\nof magnitude fewer stars. Deeper follow-up imaging confirms this object has an\nold and metal-poor stellar population and is $\\sim$ 100 kpc away. We roughly\nestimate M$_V =$ -6.75 and $r_{1/2} =$ 250 pc for this dwarf. Its luminosity is\nseveral times fainter than the faintest known Milky Way dwarf. However, its\nphysical size is typical for dSphs. Even though its absolute magnitude and size\nare presently quite uncertain, Ursa Major is likely the lowest luminosity and\nlowest surface brightness galaxy yet known.",

The cavity appears to be embedded in\nthis plume, and we interpret the structure as being entrained gas drawn out of\nthe galaxy core during previous episodes of AGN activity. The end of the plume\nis marked by a well defined edge, with significant falls in surface brightness,\ntemperature and abundance, indicating a boundary between galaxy and\ngroup/cluster gas.

Within 9 galaxies with ~6\narcsec CO and RC data available, the CO and RC emission is as tightly\ncorrelated as its global value; the radially averaged correlation is nearly\nlinear, extends over four order of magnitude and holds down to the smallest\nlinear resolution of the observations, which is ~100 pc. We define qco as the\nlog of the ratio of the CO to RC flux as a way to characterize the CO-RC\ncorrelation. Combining 6 arcsec pixel-by-pixel comparisons across all sources\nyields an average small-scale correlation of qco = 1.1 +/- 0.28; that is, the\nspatially resolved correlation has a dispersion that is less than a factor of\n2. There are however systematic variations in the CO/RC ratio; the strongest\norganized structures in qco tend to be found along spiral arms and on size\nscales much larger than the resolution of the observations. We do not measure\nany systematic trend in CO/RC ratio as a function of radius in galaxies. The\nconstancy of the CO/RC ratio stands in contrast to the previously measured\ndecrease in the FIR/RC ratio as a function of radius in galaxies.

These UCDs are found to obey the extrapolated scaling relations of\ngalaxies more closely than those of Galactic globular clusters. There appears\nto be a transition between the two types of stellar systems at a mass of about\ntwo million solar masses. If the UCDs are gravitationally bound, then we\nsuggest that the presence of dark matter is the fundamental property\ndistinguishing globular clusters from UCDs. More than half of the UCD\ncandidates uncovered in the ACS Virgo Cluster Survey are associated with a\nsingle galaxy -- M87 -- which suggests that proximity to the Virgo center may\nbe of critical importance for the formation of these objects. These results\nshow that distinguishing bonafide UCDs from bright globular clusters requires a\ncareful analysis of their detailed structural and dynamical properties,\nparticularly their mass-to-light ratios.

    "summary": "What might be the most appropriate set of interstellar reference abundances\nof chemical elements (both in gas and in dust) relative to hydrogen has been a\nsubject of much discussion in the past decade. While historically the Sun has\nbeen taken as the reference standard, it has recently been suggested that the\ninterstellar abundances might be better represented by those of B stars\n(because of their young ages) which are just ~60--70% of the widely adopted\nsolar values (``subsolar''). On the other hand, the most recent estimates of\nthe solar carbon and oxygen abundances are also close to those of B stars. If\nthe interstellar abundances are indeed ``subsolar'' like B stars or the\nnewly-determined solar C,O values, there might be a lack of raw material to\nform the dust to account for the interstellar extinction. In literature it has\nbeen argued that this problem could be solved if interstellar grains have a\nfluffy, porous structure since fluffy grains are more effective in absorbing\nand scattering optical and ultraviolet starlight than compact grains (on a per\nunit mass basis). However, we show in this work that, using the Kramers-Kronig\nrelation, fluffy dust is not able to overcome the abundance shortage problem. A\nlikely solution is that the abundances of refractory elements in stellar\nphotospheres may under-represent the composition of the interstellar material\nfrom which stars are formed, resulting either from the possible underestimation\nof the degree of heavy-element settling in stellar atmospheres, or from the\nincomplete incorporation of heavy elements in stars during the star formation\nprocess.",

In such a gedanken universe it is possible to compute the deceleration\nparameter $q_0$ measured by comoving observers using local covariant Taylor\nexpansions rather than using second order perturbation theory. The result\nindicates that second order corrections to $q_0$ are present, but shows that if\n$q_0$ is negative then its magnitude is constrained to be less than or of the\norder of the square of the peculiar velocity on Hubble scales today.

Here we reformulate this harmonic\nfunction ansatz in terms of quaternionic notation, and we show that it arises\nnaturally from the Levi-Civita connection of a conformally Euclidean metric.\n  To simplify the construction, we introduce an SO(3)-action on S^4, and we\nshow by dimensional reduction that the symmetric self-duality equation on S^4\nis equivalent to the vortex equations over hyperbolic space H^2. We thus obtain\na similar harmonic function ansatz for hyperbolic vortices, which we also\nderive using conformal transformations of H^2. Using this ansatz, we construct\nthe vortex equivalents of the symmetric 't Hooft instantons, and we prove using\nthe equivariant ADHM construction that they provide a complete description of\nall hyperbolic vortices.

    "summary": "Recent X-ray and radio observations have identified a transient low-mass\nX-ray binary (LMXB) located only 0.1 pc in projection from the Galactic center,\nCXOGC J174540.0-290031. In this paper, we report the detailed analysis of X-ray\nand infrared observations of the transient and its surroundings. Chandra\nbservations detect the source at a flux of F_X = 2e-12 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (2-8\nkeV). After accounting for absorption both in the interstellar medium and in\nmaterial local to the source, the implied luminosity of the source is only L_X\n= 4e34 erg/s (2-8 keV; D=8 kpc). However, the diffuse X-ray emission near the\nsource also brightened by a factor of 2. The enhanced diffuse X-ray emission\nlies on top of a known ridge of dust and ionized gas that is visible infrared\nimages. We interpret the X-ray emission as scattered flux from the outburst,\nand determine that the peak luminosity of CXOGC J174540.0-290031 was >2e36\nerg/s. We suggest that the relatively small observed flux results from the fact\nthat the system is observed nearly edge-on, so that the accretion disk\nintercepts most of the flux emitted along our line of sight. We compare the\ninferred peak X-ray luminosity to that of the radio jet. The ratio of the X-ray\nto radio luminosities, L_X/L_R<1e4, is considerably smaller than in other known\nLMXBs (> 1e5). This is probably because the jets are radiating with unusually\nhigh efficiency at the point where they impact the surrounding interstellar\nmedium. This hypothesis is supported by a comparison with mid-infrared images\nof the surrounding dust. Finally, we find that the minimum power required to\nproduce the jet, L_jet~1e37 erg/s, is comparable to the inferred peak X-ray\nluminosity. This is the most direct evidence yet obtained that LMXBs accreting\nat low rates release about half of their energy as jets.",

The 850 micron results\nagree with those at longer wavelengths that show a brighter flux ~7 days after\nthe burst, right at the time of the break.

The peak of\nthe afterglow emission was at ~90 GHz in the days before the break in the light\ncurve.

Any method that could make this process more efficient by\nsomehow identifying the best candidates and eliminating the worst would\ntherefore be very useful. Seager and Mallen-Ornelas (2003) demonstrated that it\nwas possible to discern between blends and exoplanets using only the\nphotometric characteristics of the transits. However, these techniques are\ncritically dependent on the shape of the transit, characterization of which\nrequires very high precision photometry of a sort that is atypical for\ncandidates identified from transit searches. We present a method relying only\non transit duration, depth, and period, which require much less precise\nphotometry to determine accurately. The numerical tool we derive, the exoplanet\ndiagnostic \\eta, is intended to identify the subset of candidates from a\ntransit search that is most likely to contain exoplanets, and thus most worthy\nof subsequent follow-up studies. The effectiveness of the diagnostic is\ndemonstrated with its success in separating modeled exoplanetary transits and\ninterlopers, and by applying it to actual OGLE transit candidates.",

Many things happened during the 15 years since the\ntime when it was written. In particular, we have learned a lot about the high\ntemperature behavior in the electroweak theory and about baryogenesis. A\ndiscovery of the acceleration of the universe has changed the way we are\nthinking about the problem of the vacuum energy: Instead of trying to explain\nwhy it is zero, we are trying to understand why it is anomalously small. Recent\ncosmological observations have shown that the universe is flat, or almost\nexactly flat, and confirmed many other predictions of inflationary theory. Many\nnew versions of this theory have been developed, including hybrid inflation and\ninflationary models based on string theory. There was a substantial progress in\nthe theory of reheating of the universe after inflation, and in the theory of\neternal inflation. It's clear, therefore, that some parts of the book should be\nupdated, which I might do sometimes in the future. I hope, however, that this\nbook may be of some interest even in its original form. I am using it in my\nlectures on inflationary cosmology at Stanford, supplementing it with the\ndiscussion of the subjects mentioned above. I would suggest to read this book\nin parallel with the book by Liddle and Lyth \"Cosmological Inflation and Large\nScale Structure,'' with the book by Mukhanov \"Physical Foundations of\nCosmology,'' to be published soon, and with my review article hep-th/0503195,\nwhich contains a discussion of some (but certainly not all) of the recent\ndevelopments in inflationary theory.",

    "summary": "Quasilinear perpendicular diffusion of charged particles in fluctuating\nelectromagnetic fields is the focus of this paper. A general transport\nparameter for perpendicular diffusion is presented being valid for an arbitrary\nturbulence geometry and a plasma wave dispersion relation varying arbitrarily\nin wavevector. The new diffusion coefficient is evaluated in detail for slab\nturbulence geometry for two special cases: (1) Alfv\\'enic turbulence and (2)\ndynamical magnetic turbulence. Furthermore, perpendicular diffusion in 2D\ngeometry is considered for a purely dynamical magnetic turbulence. The\nderivations and numerical calculations presented here cast serious doubts on\nthe applicability of quasilinear theory for perpendicular diffusion.\nFurthermore, they emphasize that nonlinear effects play a crucial role in the\ncontext of perpendicular diffusion.",

A number and a character of ties\ndetermine now an internal symmetry group, while in the supersymmetrical models\nthis one is determined by an extension degree N. Such a model can be\nconstructed for no less than 4 generations of the two-component fundamental\nfermions. Analogues of the Higgs fields appear in the model naturally after\ntransition to the Grassmannian extra coordinates. The connection between\ndiscrete and continues internal symmetries of the model is discussed. If one\nconsiders gravity as embedding the curved 4-space into a 12-dimensional flat\nspace, a U(1)-symmetry appears transformations of which should be connected\nwith the ones of SU(2)-group. If super-strong interacting gravitons are\nconstituents of the composite fermions, all this may open us another way to\nunify the known interactions. The main feature of this new approach may be the\nexternal see of gravitons underlying an internal structure of particles; the\nlack of any divergencies would be due the Planckian spectrum of external\ngravitons.",

Rather than maintaining and updating the global\nstate of the system, the algorithm tries to examine only essential events,\ni.e., component interactions. The events are processed in a non-decreasing\norder of time; new interactions are scheduled on the basis of the examined\ninteractions using preintegrated equations of the evolutions of the components.\nIf the components are distributed uniformly enough in the evolution space, so\nthat this space can be subdivided into small sectors such that only O(1)\nsectors and O(1)$components are in the neighborhood of a sector, then the\nalgorithm spends time O (log N) for processing an event which is the\nasymptotical minimum. The algorithm uses a simple strategy for handling data:\nonly two states are maintained for each simulated component. Fast data access\nin this strategy assures the practical efficiency of the algorithm.

We compare the\nabundances of He, N, O, Ne, and S obtained from emission line strengths and [O\nIII] and [N II] temperatures to those in our models. We consider stellar\ntemperatures in the range 37.5 -- 45kK and ionizing luminosities from 10^{48}\nto 10^{51} photons/s.\n  Clumped models have different ionic abundances than uniform. For hot stars,\nHe^0/He^+ is 2 -- 3%, much larger than with uniform models. This amount of He I\nis independent of metallicity and so impacts the determination of the\nprimordial abundance of He. The total abundances of O, Ne, and S obtained by\nthe usual methods of analysis, using T([OIII) for high stages of ionization and\nT([NII]) for low, are about as accurate for clumped models as for uniform and\nwithin about 20% of the true values. If T([OIII]) is used for analyzing all\nions, the derived (O/H) is 40 to 60% too large for cool stars but is good for\nhot stars. Uniform models have similar errors, so the clumping does not change\nthe accuracy of abundance analysis.\n  The physical causes of the ionic abundance errors are present in real\nnebulae. In clumped models, helium ionizing radiation from zones of high\nionization (low He^0 and low UV opacity) can penetrate nearby regions near the\nedge of the ionized zone. This effect allows He^0 to absorb more stellar\nphotons than in uniform or radially symmetrical geometries. In turn, these\nabsorptions compete with O+, etc., for those energetic stellar photons.",

Our construction starts from the\nobservation that the fermions of the continuum theory can be mapped into the\ncomponent fields of a single real anticommuting Kahler-Dirac field. The\noriginal supersymmetry algebra then implies the existence of a nilpotent scalar\nsupercharge $Q$ and a corresponding set of bosonic superpartners. Using this\nfield content we write down a $Q$-exact action and show that, with an\nappropriate change of variables, it reduces to a well-known twist of ${\\cal\nN}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory due to Marcus. Using the discretization\nprescription developed in an earlier paper on the ${\\cal N}=2$ theory in two\ndimensions we are able to translate this geometrical action to the lattice.",

The resonances were most likely established by\nconverging differential migration of the planets leading to capture into the\nresonances. A problem with this scenario is that continued migration of the\nsystem while it is trapped in the resonances leads to orbital eccentricities\nthat rapidly exceed the observational upper limits of e_1 = 0.31 and e_2 =\n0.05. As seen in forced 3-body simulations, lower eccentricities would persist\nduring migration only for an applied eccentricity damping.\n  Here we explore the evolution of the GJ 876 system using two-dimensional\nhydrodynamical simulations that include viscous heating and radiative effects.\nWe find that a hydrodynamic evolution within the resonance, where only the\nouter planet interacts with the disk, always rapidly leads to large values of\neccentricities that exceed those observed.\n  Only if mass is removed from the disk on a time scale of the order of the\nmigration time scale (before there has been extensive migration after capture),\nas might occur for photoevaporation in the late phases of planet formation, can\nwe end up with eccentricities that are consistent with the observations.",

By taking\ninto account the renormalization of both the anisotropy and the Euclidean\ncoupling, we calculate the string tension and masses of the scalar, axial\nvector and tensor states using standard Wilson action on increasingly\nanisotropic lattices, and make an extrapolation to the Hamiltonian limit. The\nresults are compared with estimates from various other Hamiltonian and\nEuclidean studies. We find that more accurate determination of the glueball\nmasses and the mass ratios has been achieved and the results are a significant\nimprovement upon previous Hamiltonian estimates. The continuum predictions are\nthen found by extrapolation of results obtained from smallest values of spatial\nlattice spacing. For the lightest scalar, tensor and axial vector states we\nobtain masses of $m_{0^{++}}=1654 \\pm 83$ MeV, $m_{2^{++}}=2272\\pm 115$ MeV and\n$m_{1^{+-}}=2940\\pm 165$ MeV, respectively. These are consistent with the\nestimates obtained in the previous studies in the Euclidean limit. The\nconsistency is a clear evidence of universality between Euclidean and\nHamiltonian formulations.

We begin by showing how\nthe application of Raychaudhuri equation to inhomogeneous cosmologies results\nin several ``no go'' theorems for accelerated expansion. Next we derive an\nexact solution for a specific case of initial perturbations, for which\napplication of the Kolb et al. expressions leads to an acceleration, while the\nexact solution reveals that no acceleration is present. We show that the\ndiscrepancy can be traced to higher order terms that were dropped in the Kolb\net al. analysis. We proceed with the analysis of initial value formulation of\ngeneral relativity to argue that causality severely limits what observable\neffects can be derived from superhorizon perturbations. By constructing a\nRiemann normal coordinate system on initial slice we show that no infrared\ndivergence terms arise in this coordinate system. Thus any divergences found\npreviously can be eliminated by a local rescaling of coordinates and are\nunobservable. We perform an explicit analysis of the variance of the\ndeceleration parameter for the case of single field inflation using usual\ncoordinates and show that the infrared divergent terms found by Barausse et al.\nand Kolb et al. cancel against several additional terms not considered in their\nanalysis.

Our results show that the conductance and the\ndensity of states (DOS) are strongly dependent on the configurations of the\nmagnetic electrodes. In parallel configuration of magnetic electrodes the\nconductance is affected by the spin-flip process and the Coulomb repulsion on\nthe dot. The Kondo peak for spin-dependent transport is splitted into two peaks\nby the spin-flip process. The locations of the two peaks are symmetric about no\nspin-flip peak and the separation of the splitting is dependent on the strength\nof the spin-flip parameter $R$. This effect may be useful to realize the\nspin-filter device.",

The ground and thermal state entanglement properties of the\ntetramer are calculated analytically in the various limiting cases.

The magnetic properties of a S = 1/2 AFM polyoxovanadate\ncompound, V12, are well explained by spin tetramers with only nearest-neighbour\nexchange interactions. Treating the magnetic susceptibility chi as an\nentanglement witness (EW), an estimate of the lower bound of the critical\nentanglement temperature, T_c, above which the multipartite entanglement\ndisappears in the experimental compound, is determined. A second EW based on\nenergy provides an estimate of the entanglement temperature T_E, below which\nbipartite entanglement is certainly present in the system, is determined.

The background\nsources are assumed to follow a uniform ellipticity distribution from 0 to 0.5\nand to have an area identical to a circular source with diameter $1\\arcsec$. We\nfind that the optical depth scales as the source redshift approximately as\n$\\tau_{1''} = 2.25 \\times 10^{-6}/[1+(\\zs/3.14)^{-3.42}]$ ($0.6<\\zs<7$).

The differences can be mostly explained by different power spectrum\nnormalizations ($\\sigma_8$) used and different ways of determining the $L/W$\nratio.

In this paper the observed emission is assumed to be\ndue to a population of relativistic, non-thermal electrons (e.g. produced in a\nflare) injected at the top of an accretion disk magnetic loop. While electrons\nstream along magnetic field lines their energy distribution evolves in time\nessentially because of inverse Compton and synchrotron losses. The\ncorresponding time dependent emission due, in the X-ray energy range, to the\ninverse Compton mechanism, has been computed. Since the typical decay time of a\nflare is shorter than the integration time for data acquisition in the X-ray\ndomain, the resulting spectrum is derived as the temporal mean of the real,\ntime-dependent, emission, as originated by a series of consecutive and\nidentical flares. The model outcome is compared to both the broad band BeppoSAX\nX-ray data of the bright Seyfert 1 NGC 5548, and to a few general X-ray\nspectral properties of Seyfert 1s as a class. The good agreement between model\nand observations suggests that the presently proposed non-thermal,\nnon-stationary model could be a plausible explanation of AGN X-ray emission, as\nan alternative to thermal coronae models.",

The set of measurements was\nperformed for an optimally doped sample (y = 7), then the oxygen content in the\nthe same crystal was reduced to y = 6.65, and the measurements were repeated.\nFor both cases Lxy's are about two times larger than the Sommerfeld's value of\nthe Lorenz number and depend weakly on temperature in a range 300 - 160 K.\nBelow T = 160 K the Hall-Lorenz number for the optimally doped sample slowly\ndrops, while the value of Lxy for the oxygen reduced sample begins to rise.\nSuch results suggest that the electronic system in the investigated compound\nmay be considered as a metallic one with pseudo-gaps that open at the Fermi\nlevel.",

The chiral symmetry is found to be broken if\nthe influx of substrate lies within a finite interval.

    "summary": "New measurements of the stellar-mass deficits at the centers of luminous\nelliptical galaxies are presented. These were derived considering the following\nobservational facts. Firstly, ``core'' galaxies, which are thought to have had\ntheir inner region depleted from the coalesence of supermassive black holes,\nshow an abrupt downward deviation of their inner light-profile relative to\ntheir outer Sersic profile. Second, ``power-law'' galaxies, having undisturbed\nprofiles and no partially depleted core, have inner light-profiles that display\nno departure from the inward extrapolation of their outer Sersic profile. The\ncentral stellar deficits have therefore been derived from the difference in\nflux between the HST-observed galaxy light-profiles and the inward\nextrapolation of each galaxy's outer Sersic profile. This approach gives flux\ndeficits ~0.1% of the total galaxy light, and mass deficits that are ~2 times\neach galaxy's central supermassive black hole mass. These results are in\nagreement with the theoretical expectations of mass ejection from binary black\nhole mergers and also with popular LCDM models of hierarchical galaxy\nformation. It is also explained why this result is some 10 times smaller than\ncurrent observational estimates of the central mass deficit, and therefore\nimplies a merger history for giant elliptical galaxies that is one order of\nmagnitude less violent than previously suggested.",

These Doublets make a\nsignificatively strong use of the hybridization terms of the Hamiltonian, and\nhave a much larger Kondo-like correlation energy than a single impurity (the\nKondo energy). Furthermore, these Doublets combine to form a Super-Singlet.\nThis Super-Singlet makes use of the remaining hybridization probability to\nimprove its energy with respect to the Doublets energy, but for low-Dimensional\nsystems and at the inter-impurity distances where the Doublets are full\ndeveloped, its energy gain is exponentially small. The interaction behind the\nDoublets is a first-order (in the effective Kondo coupling) one, it also\ngenerates a parallel alignment of the impurity-spins. This ferromagnetic\nimpurity-impurity response is thus generated without resort to the RKKY\ninteraction.

The subsystems represent\nparticles of arbitrary spin j which transform according to an irreducible\nrepresentation of the rotation group. A positive map theta is introduced which\ndescribes the time reversal symmetry of the local states and which is unitarily\nequivalent to the transposition of matrices. It is shown that the partial time\nreversal transformation theta_2 = (I tensor theta) acting on the composite\nsystem can be expressed in terms of the invariant 6-j symbols introduced by\nWigner into the quantum theory of angular momentum. This fact enables a\ncomplete geometrical construction of the manifold of states with positive\npartial transposition and of the sets of separable and entangled states of (4\ntensor 4) systems. The separable states are shown to form a three-dimensional\nprism and a three-dimensional manifold of bound entangled states is identified.\nA positive maps is obtained which yields, together with the time reversal, a\nnecessary and sufficient condition for the separability of states of (4 tensor\n4) systems.

We derive the maximum density of the caustics\nand show that it depends on the velocity dispersion and the caustic location.\nWe show that both the absolute and relative thickness of the caustic\nmonotonically decrease toward the center of the halo while the maximum density\ngrows. This indicates that the radial component of the thermal velocities\ndecreases in the inner streams, i.e. the collisionless medium cools down in the\nradial direction descending to the center of the halo.

Our results indicate that the distribution of galaxies shows a\nsignificant anti-bias at highly non-linear small cluster-centric distances\n(b_cg(r) ~ 0.7), irrespective of the group/cluster virial mass or X-ray\nluminosity and galaxy characteristics, which show that a generic process\ncontrols the efficiency of galaxy formation and evolution in high density\nregions. On larger scales b_cg(r) rises to a nearly constant value of order\nunity, the transition occuring at approximately 2 Mpch^(-1) for 2dF groups and\n5 Mpch^(-1) for REFLEX clusters.",

Either selecting BLCCs by their (B-V) colors or by the\nstrength of their Hbeta index the cluster sample turns out to be distributed\nonto the outskirts of M31 disc, sharing the kinematical properties of the thin,\nrapidly rotating disc component.\n  If confirmed to be young and not metal-poor, these clusters indicate the\noccurrence of a significant recent star formation in the thin disc of M31,\nalthough they do not set constraints on the epoch of its early formation.",

Our recent work (Bournaud et al. 2004) shows that the\nabove range of mass ratio results in hybrid systems with spiral-like luminosity\nprofiles but with elliptical-like kinematics, as observed in the data analysis\nfor a sample of mergers by Jog & Chitre (2002). In this paper, we study the\nmerger-remnants for mass ratios from 1:1 to 10:1 while systematically covering\nthe parameter space. We obtain the morphological and kinematical properties of\nthe remnants, and also discuss the robustness and the visibility of disks in\nthe merger remnants with a random line-of-sight. We show that the mass ratios\n1:1-3:1 give rise to elliptical remnants whereas the mass ratios 4.5:1-10:1\nproduce the hybrid systems with mixed properties. We find that the transition\nbetween disk-like and elliptical remnants occurs between a narrow mass-range of\n4.5:1-3:1. The unequal-mass mergers are more likely to occur than the standard\nequal-mass mergers studied in the literature so far, and we discuss their\nimplications for the evolution of galaxies.",

For this reason, we explore\nalternative oscillation approaches that would still succeed even if theta_13\nvanishes. We identify several alternatives that require neither a nonzero\n|U_e3| nor the presence of significant matter effects.

We used an automated clump-finding algorithm to identify 67 clumps\nin the 450 micron image and 77 in the 850 micron image. Contrary to previous\nstudies, we find a positive correlation between high spectral index, alpha, and\nhigh submillimeter flux, with the difference being accounted for by different\ntreatments of the error beam. We interpret the higher spectral index at\nsubmillimeter peaks as a reflection of elevated dust temperature, particularly\nwhen there is an embedded infrared source, though it may also reflect changing\ndust properties. The clump mass-radius relationship is well-fit by a power law\nof the form M \\propto R^(-x) with x = 1.5-2.1, consistent with theories of\nturbulently-supported clumps. According to our most reliable analysis, the\nhigh-mass end (approx. 100-2700 M_sun) of the submillimeter clump mass function\nin NGC 7538 follows a Salpeter-like power law with index 2.0 +/- 0.3. This\nresult agrees well with similar studies of lower-mass regions rho Oph and Orion\nB. We interpret the apparent invariance of the shape of the clump mass function\nover a broad range of parent cloud masses as evidence for the self-similarity\nof the physical processes which determine it.

A new nonadiabatic code, that adopts the so-called\n`traditional approximation' to treat the Coriolis force, is used to investigate\nthe influence exerted by rotation over the stability of stellar models covering\nthe mass range 2.5 M_sun <= M_* <= 13.0 M_sun. The principal finding is that,\nfor all modes considered apart from the prograde sectoral class, rotation\nshifts the kappa-mechanism instability toward higher luminosities and effective\ntemperatures; these shifts are accompanied by broadenings in the extent of\ninstability strips. Such behaviour is traced to the shortening of mode periods\nunder the action of the Coriolis force. Instability strips associated with\nprograde sectoral modes behave rather differently, being shifted to marginally\nlower luminosities and effective temperatures under the influence of rotation.\n  The implications of these results are discussed in the context of the\nobservational scarcity of pulsation in B-type stars having significant\nrotation; various scenarios are explored to explain the apparent dichotomy\nbetween theory and observations. Furthermore, the possible significance of the\nfindings to Be stars is briefly examined.",

The modified fragmentation\nfunctions for dihadrons are found to follow closely that of single hadrons\nleading to a weak nuclear suppression of their ratios as measured by HERMES in\nDIS experiments. Meanwhile, a moderate medium enhancement of the near-side\ncorrelation of two high $p_T$ hadrons is found in central heavy-ion collisions,\npartially due to trigger bias caused by the competition between parton energy\nloss and the initial Cronin effect.",

We find that the power spectrum of the induced CMB\nanisotropies depends sensitively on the character of the reionization epoch.\nModels that differ in the extent of the \"patchy phase\" could be distinguished\nby future experiments such as the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the\nSouth Pole Telescope (SPT). In our models, the patchy signal peaks at $l\\simeq\n2000$, where it can be four times larger than the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich\n(kSZ)/Ostriker-Vishniac (OV) signal ($\\Delta T_{\\rm tot} \\simeq 2.6 \\mu K$). On\nscales beyond $l \\simeq 4000$ the total Doppler signal is dominated by kSZ/OV,\nbut the patchy signal can contribute up to 30% to the power spectrum. The\neffect of patchy reionization is largest on scales where the primordial CMB\nanisotropies dominate.

Under appropriate conditions,\ncrystals were found to form layered systems. The system's structural phase\ntransitions, including transitions between crystals with differing numbers of\nlayers and the same number of layers but different intralayer structures, were\ninvestigated and found to agree with previous theoretical and experimental\nresearch results. One- to two-layer transitions were examined in detail and\nshown to start at the point where the out-of-plane lattice instability appears.\nThe resulting three layer system caused by this instability was observed at the\ncenter of the system. Finally, growth rates for this out-of-plane lattice\ninstability were obtained using the BOXITREE simulation with these results\nshown to agree with those obtained from analytical theory.",

Jean-Claude Guedon argues against the efficacy of author\nself-archiving of peer-reviewed journal articles (the \"Green\" road to OA). He\nsuggests instead that we should convert to Open Access Publishing (the \"Golden\"\nroad to OA) by \"mixing and matching\" Green and Gold as follows: o First,\nself-archive dissertations (not published, peer-reviewed journal articles). o\nSecond, identify and tag how those dissertations have been evaluated and\nreviewed. o Third, self-archive unrefereed preprints (not published,\npeer-reviewed journal articles). o Fourth, develop new mechanisms for\nevaluating and reviewing those unrefereed preprints, at multiple levels. The\nresult will be OA Publishing (Gold). I argue that rather than yet another 10\nyears of speculation like this, what is actually needed (and imminent) is for\nOA self-archiving to be mandated by research funders and institutions so that\nthe self-archiving of published, peer-reviewed journal articles (Green) can be\nfast-forwarded to 100% OA.",

Bands of 12C16O also are present but no\nbands of 13C16O or 12C17O are seen. We estimate an isotopic ratio 16O/18O ~1.\nThe Solar value of this ratio is ~500. Neither He-core burning nor He-shell\nflash burning can produce the isotopic ratios of oxygen and carbon observed in\nHD 137613. However, a remarkable similarity exists between the observed\nabundances and those found in the outer layers of the broad He-shell of\nearly-AGB stars, soon after the end of He-core burning. It is not known how the\nouter envelope down to the He-shell could be lost but some mechanism of\nenhanced mass loss must be involved. HD 137613 may be a post-early-AGB star\nwith the outer layers of the former He-burning shell as its photosphere.\n  The unusual elemental abundances of the HdC stars resemble those of the R\nCoronae Borealis (RCB) stars, but HdC stars do not produce clouds of dust that\nproduce declines in brightness.

This adds a new puzzle in the origin of X-ray\nemission which cannot be easily explained within the standard model in\naccordance of which X-rays are result of synchrotron radiation of multi-TeV\nelectrons accelerated by supernova shock waves. We explore an alternative\norigin of the X-ray emission assuming that it is produced by secondary\nelectrons resulting from high energy hadronic interactions in the molecular\ngas. Such a scenario could explain in a quite natural way the apparent\ncorrelation between the X-ray and CO morphologies. However, the TeV gamma-ray\nemission recently reported by H.E.S.S. significantly constrains the parameter\nspace of this model. Namely, this mechanism cannot reproduce the bulk of the\nobserved X-ray flux unless one postulates existence of a PeV cosmic-ray\ncomponent penetrating with an unusually hard spectrum into the dense cloud.",

We find a pronounced central spike\n(r<0.5 Mpc), followed by a depletion region at about 1.5 Mpc, and a broad\nsecondary excess centered at approximately the virial radius of the host\nclusters (~2.5 Mpc).

The nanorods, largely\nisolated from but perfectly aligned with the sustaining matrix, are grown in\nexcellent epitaxy with the Si substrates.",

In the present work,\nsimilar behavior is found for double tearing modes (DTM) on resonant surfaces\nwith q >= 1. A detailed analysis of linear instability characteristics of DTMs\nwith various mode numbers m is performed using numerical simulations. The mode\nstructures and dispersion relations for linearly unstable modes are calculated.\nComparisons between low- and higher-m modes are carried out, and the roles of\nthe inter-resonance distance and of the magnetic Reynolds number S_Hp are\ninvestigated. High-m modes are found to be destabilized when the distance\nbetween the resonant surfaces is small. They dominate over low-m modes in a\nwide range of S_Hp, including regimes relevant for tokamak operation.

Very few molecules have convenient properties,\nthe simplest one being atomic hydrogen in 2S and 2P states (called H* here).\n  The interaction increases the entropy of a set of beams without a permanent\nexcitation of H*, a loss of energy by a beam having a high Planck's temperature\nproducing a decrease of its frequency, and the thermal radiation getting\nenergy.\n  Atomic hydrogen in its ground state is pumped to H* by Lyman alpha\nabsorptions, producing a redshift of the light. The combination of the Lyman\nabsorptions and the redshifts they produce, induce oscillations which generate\na spectrum in which the lines deduce from each other by relative frequency\nshifts which are products of an integer by a constant z_b=0.062.\n  These purely physical results may be applied in astrophysics, searching where\nH* may appear. In particular, the computed spectra of the accreting neutron\nstars, remarkably identical to the spectra of the quasars, may explain that\nthese stars seem never observed. The too high frequencies of the radio signals\nfrom the Pioneer probes may result from a transfer of energy from the solar\nlight allowed by a cooling of the solar wind able to produce H*.

Based on this picture, the Fano interference in the\nconductance spectra of the DQD system is readily explained. The possibility of\nmanipulating the Fano lineshape in the tunnelling spectra of the DQD system is\nexplored by tuning the dot-lead coupling, the inter-dot coupling, the magnetic\nflux threading the ring connecting dots and leads, and the flux difference\nbetween two sub-rings. It has been found that by making use of various tuning,\nthe direction of the asymmetric tail of Fano lineshape may be flipped by\nexternal fields, and the continuous conductance spectra may be magnetically\nmanipulated with lineshape retained. More importantly, by adjusting the\nmagnetic flux, the function of two molecular states can be exchanged, giving\nrise to a swap effect, which might play a role as a qubit in the quantum\ncomputation.",

Our analysis of synthetic photometric colors of\nlate-type giants based on PHOENIX, MARCS and ATLAS model atmospheres indicates\na general agreement between the current theoretical predictions and\nobservations in the framework of stationary 1-D model atmospheres. Presently\navailable models allow temperature determinations of RGB/AGB stars to an\naccuracy of ~\\pm100 K.

Using\nNBODY6 which takes into account the two-body relaxation correctly, we\ninvestigate general evolution of globular clusters in galactic tidal field. For\nsimplicity, we have employed only spherical components (bulge and halo) of the\ngalaxy. Total number of stars in our simulations was about 20,000. All\nsimulations were done for several orbital periods in order to understand the\ndevelopment of the tidal tails. In our scaled down models, the relaxation time\nis sufficiently short to show the mass segregation effect, but we did not go\nfar enough to see the core-collapse, and the fraction of stars lost from the\ncluster at the end of simulation is only about 10%. The radial distribution of\nextra-tidal stars can be described by a power law with a slope around -3. The\ndirection of tidal tails are determined by the orbits and locations of the\nclusters. We find that the length of tidal tails increases towards the\napogalacticon and decreases towards the perigalacticon. This is an\nanti-correlation with the strength of the tidal field, caused by the fact that\nthe the time-scale for the stars to respond to the potential is similar to the\norbital time-scale of the cluster. When the length of tidal tails decreases\nsome of the stars in the tidal tails are recaptured by the host cluster. From\nthe investigation of velocity anisotropy of the model clusters, we find that in\nthe early stages of globular cluster evolution the clusters have radial\nanisotropy in the outermost parts, while clusters are nearly isotropic in the\ncental region. The radial anisotropy decreases with time.",

The\ndistribution of traps in this extended trap model (ETM) is fully determined by\nthe thermodynamics of the glass-former.

Comparing molecular dynamics simulations of the Lennard-Jones system\nwith Monte Carlo calculations of the ETM allows one to determine the adjustable\nparameters.

We find that there are three\ndistinct processes which can possibly contribute to the black-hole spin\nmagnitude: a birth spin for the black hole, imparted at either (i) the collapse\nof a massive progenitor star to a black hole or (ii) the accretion-induced\ncollapse of a neutron star to a black hole; and (iii) an accretion spin-up when\nthe already formed black hole [via (i) or (ii)] goes through an accretion\nepisode (through an accretion disk or a common-envelope phase). Our results\nshow that, with regard to accretion-induced spinup in merging BH-NS binaries\n[method (iii) above], only\n  {\\em accretion episodes associated with common-envelope phases and\nhypercritical accretion rates} occur in the formation history of merging black\nhole/neutron star binaries. Lacking unambiguous experimental information about\nBH birth spins [i.e., regarding the results of processes (i) and (ii)], we\nchoose two fiducial values for the BH birth angular momentum parameter a=J/M^2,\nconsistent with observations of (i) NS birth spins (a roughly 0) and (ii) X-ray\nbinaries (a=0.5). Using these two fiducial values and a conservative upper\nbound on the specific angular momentum of accreted matter, we discuss the\nexpected range of black hole spins in the binaries of interest. We conclude\nwith comments on the significance of these results for ground-based\ngravitational-wave searches of inspiral signals from black hole binaries.",

This leaves the NF intergable and its\nsolutons retain the character of the solutions of the unperturbed equation. We\nexploit the freedom in the expansion to construct canonical obstacles which are\nconfined to te interaction region of the waves. Fo soliton solutions, e.g., in\nthe KdV equation, the interaction region is a finite domain around the origin;\nthe canonical obstacles then do not generate secular terms in the homological\nequation. When the interaction region is infifnite, or semi-infinite, e.g., in\nwave-front solutions of the Burgers equation, the obstacles may contain\nresonant terms. The obstacles generate waves of a new type, which cannot be\nwritten as functionals of the solutions of the NF. When an obstacle contributes\na resonant term to the NF, this leads to a non-standard update of th wave\nvelocity.",

Applying the\nappropriate non-homogeneous Maxwell equation to both operations, we have\nrevealed an additional symmetric term in the tensor, named as \"compensating\nterm\". Analyzing the structure of this \"compensating term\", we suggested a\nmethod of \"gauge renormalization, which allows transforming the divergent terms\nof classical electrodynamics (infinite self-force, self-energy and\nself-momentum) to converging integrals. The motional equation obtained for a\nnon-radiating charged particle does not contain its self-force, and the mass\nparameter includes the sum of mechanical and electromagnetic masses. The\nmotional equation for a radiating particle also contains the sum of mechanical\nand electromagnetic masses, and does not yield any \"runaway solutions\". It has\nbeen shown that the energy flux in a free electromagnetic field is guided by\nthe Poynting vector, whereas the energy flux in a bound EM field is described\nby the generalized Umov vector, defined in the paper. The problem of \"Poincare\nstresses\" is also examined. It has been shown that the presence of the\n\"compensating term\" in the electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor allows a\nsolution of the \"4/3 problem\", where the total observable mass of the electron\nis completely determined by the Poincare stresses and hence the conventional\nrelativistic relationship between the energy and momentum is recovered.",

    "summary": "Reaction theory is an essential ingredient when performing studies of nuclei\nfar from stability. One approach for the calculation of breakup reactions of\nexotic nuclei into two fragments is to consider inelastic excitations into the\nsingle particle continuum of the projectile. Alternatively one can also\nconsider the transfer to the continuum of a system composed of the light\nfragment and the target. In this work we make a comparative study of the two\napproaches, underline the different inputs, and identify the advantages and\ndisadvantages of each approach. Our test cases consist of the breakup of\n$^{11}$Be on a proton target at intermediate energies, and the breakup of $^8$B\non $^{58}$Ni at energies around the Coulomb barrier. We find that, in practice\nthe results obtained in both schemes are in semiquantitative agreement. We\nsuggest a simple condition that can select between the two approaches.",

We find\nthat changes in $\\mu $ will be driven by the electronic energy density after\nthe electron mass threshold is crossed. Particle production in this scenario is\nnegligible. The cosmological constraints imposed by recent astronomical\nobservations are very weak, due to the low mass density in electrons. Unlike in\nsimilar theories for spacetime variation of the fine structure constant, the\nobservational constraints on variations in $\\mu $ imposed by the weak\nequivalence principle are much more stringent constraints than those from\nquasar spectra. Any time-variation in the electron-proton mass ratio must be\nless than one part in $10^{9}$since redshifts $z\\approx 1.$This is more than\none thousand times smaller than current spectroscopic sensitivities can\nachieve. Astronomically observable variations in the electron-proton must\ntherefore arise directly from effects induced by varying fine structure\n'constant' or by processes associated with internal proton structure.

Especially for larger values of the nonlinear\ninteraction term and larger barrier heights, results from this model produce\nbetter agreement with numerical solutions of the time-dependent\nGross-Pitaevskii equation in 1D and 3D, as compared with previous models with\nconstant tunneling, and better agreement with experimental results for the\ntunneling oscillation frequency [Albiez et al., cond-mat/0411757].

    "summary": "Nowadays, tiered architectures are widely accepted for constructing large\nscale information systems. In this context application servers often form the\nbottleneck for a system's efficiency. An application server exposes an object\noriented interface consisting of set of methods which are accessed by\npotentially remote clients. The idea of method caching is to store results of\nread-only method invocations with respect to the application server's interface\non the client side. If the client invokes the same method with the same\narguments again, the corresponding result can be taken from the cache without\ncontacting the server. It has been shown that this approach can considerably\nimprove a real world system's efficiency.\n  This paper extends the concept of method caching by addressing the case where\nclients wrap related method invocations in ACID transactions. Demarcating\nsequences of method calls in this way is supported by many important\napplication server standards. In this context the paper presents an\narchitecture, a theory and an efficient protocol for maintaining full\ntransactional consistency and in particular serializability when using a method\ncache on the client side. In order to create a protocol for scheduling cached\nmethod results, the paper extends a classical transaction formalism. Based on\nthis extension, a recovery protocol and an optimistic serializability protocol\nare derived. The latter one differs from traditional transactional cache\nprotocols in many essential ways. An efficiency experiment validates the\napproach: Using the cache a system's performance and scalability are\nconsiderably improved.",

When this function is the sum of constant node weights,\nthe problem is trivially solved in linear time. When the objective is the sum\nof weights that are linear functions of a parameter, we show how to list all\noptima for all possible parameter values in O(n log n) time; this parametric\noptimization problem can be used to solve many bicriterion optimizations\nproblems, in which each node has two values xi and yi associated with it, and\nthe objective function is a bivariate function f(SUM(xi),SUM(yi)) of the sums\nof these two values. A special case, when f is the ratio of the two sums, is\nthe Weighted Maximum-Mean Subtree Problem, or equivalently the Fractional\nPrize-Collecting Steiner Tree Problem on Trees; for this special case, we\nprovide a linear time algorithm for this problem when all weights are positive,\nimproving a previous O(n log n) solution, and prove that the problem is\nNP-complete when negative weights are allowed.",

The method is used for deriving criteria for\nthe minimum and maximum resolvable sizes of a template. The minimum resolvable\nsize of a template is determined by the ratio of (SNR-1)/SNR, and the maximum\ndetectable size is determined by the ratio of 1/SNR. Application of these\ncriteria is discussed in connection to data from filled-aperture instruments\nand interferometers, accounting for different aperture shapes and the effects\nof Fourier sampling, tapering, apodization and visibility weighting. Specific\nresolution limits are derived for four different templates of brightness\ndistribution: (1) two-dimensional Gaussian, (2) optically thin spherical shell,\n(3) disk of uniform brightness, and (4) ring. The limiting resolution for these\ntemplates changes with SNR similarly to the quantum limit on resolution.\nPractical application of the resolution limits is discussed in two examples\ndealing with measurements of maximum brightness temperature in compact\nrelativistic jets and assessments of morphology of young supernova remnants.",

    "summary": "Many quantum algorithms, including Shor's celebrated factoring and discrete\nlog algorithms, proceed by reduction to a Hidden Subgroup problem, in which an\nunknown subgroup H of a group G must be determined from a uniform superposition\non a left coset of H. These hidden subgroup problems are typically solved by\nFourier sampling. When G is nonabelian, two important variants of Fourier\nsampling have been identified: the weak standard method, where only\nrepresentation names are measured, and the strong standard method, where full\nmeasurement (i.e., the row and column of the representation, in a suitably\nchosen basis) occurs. It has remained open whether the strong standard method\nis indeed stronger. In this article, we settle this question in the\naffirmative. We show that hidden subgroups H of the q-hedral groups, i.e.,\nsemidirect products Z_q \\ltimes Z_p where q | (p-1), and in particular the\naffine groups A_p, can be information-theoretically reconstructed using the\nstrong standard method. Moreover, if |H| = p/ \\polylog(p), these subgroups can\nbe fully reconstructed with a polynomial amount of quantum and classical\ncomputation. We show that, for some q, neither the ``forgetful'' abelian method\nnor measuring in a random basis succeeds, even information-theoretically. Thus,\nat least for some groups, it is crucial to use the full power of representation\ntheory: namely, to measure the high-dimensional representations in an adapted\nbasis that respects the group's subgroup structure. We apply our algorithm for\nthe hidden subgroup problem to new families of cryptographically motivated\nHidden Shift problems, generalizing work of van Dam, Hallgren and Ip on shifts\nof multiplicative characters.",

The antiferromagnetic phase is unstable to\nhole or electron doping of at most 15%, yielding to two distinct \"tau\" phases:\nfor large coupling U/t, one such phase occurs between 30-35% hole or electron\ndoping, and for small to intermediate coupling U/t another such phase occurs\nbetween 10-18% doping. Both tau phases are distinguished by non-zero hole or\nelectron hopping expectation values at all length scales.

The low-temperature\nspecific heat of the weak-coupling tau phase shows a BCS-type exponential\ndecay, indicating a gap in the excitation spectrum, and a cusp singularity at\nthe phase boundary.

The simulations include\nradiative cooling, a density-dependent star formation recipe and a model for\nfeedback from massive stars. The feedback model stores supernova feedback\nenergy within individual gas particles and dissipates this energy on a\ntime-scale specified by two free parameters; tau_fb, which sets the dissipative\ntime-scale, and n, which sets the effective equation of state in star-forming\nregions. Using a self-consistent disc galaxy, modelled after a local Sbc\nspiral, in both isolated and major-merger simulations, we investigate\nparametrizations of the feedback model that are selected with respect to the\nquiescent disc stability. These models produce a range of star formation\nhistories that are consistent with the star formation relation found by\nKennicutt. All major mergers produce a population of new stars that is highly\ncentrally concentrated, demonstrating a distinct break in the r1/4 surface\ndensity profile, consistent with previous findings. The half-mass radius and\none-dimensional velocity dispersion are affected by the feedback model used.\nFinally, we compare our results to those of previous simulations of star\nformation in disc-galaxy major mergers, addressing the effects of star\nformation normalization, the version of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH)\nemployed and assumptions about the interstellar medium.",

Together with previous detections we\nfind that X-ray emission is detected from at least one radio lobe in ~75\npercent of the sample. For all of the lobe detections, we find that the\nmeasured X-ray flux can be attributed to inverse-Compton scattering of the\ncosmic microwave background radiation, with magnetic field strengths in the\nlobes between (0.3 - 1.3) B_eq, where the value B_eq corresponds to\nequipartition between the electrons and magnetic field assuming a filling\nfactor of unity. There is a strong peak in the magnetic field strength\ndistribution at B ~ 0.7 B_eq. We find that > 70 percent of the radio lobes are\neither at equipartition or electron dominated by a small factor. The\ndistribution of measured magnetic field strengths differs for narrow-line and\nbroad-line objects, in the sense that broad-line radio galaxies and quasars\nappear to be further from equipartition; however, this is likely to be due to a\ncombination of projection effects and worse systematic uncertainty in the X-ray\nanalysis for those objects. Our results suggest that the lobes of classical\ndouble radio sources do not contain an energetically dominant proton\npopulation, because this would require the magnetic field energy density to be\nsimilar to the electron energy density rather than the overall energy density\nin relativistic particles.",

For random curves in the interior we show that the\ninduced random motion on the boundary is not Markov if the domain is multiply\nconnected, but that the random motion on the boundary together with the random\nmotion of the moduli forms a Markov process. In the chordal case, we show that\nthis Markov process satisfies Brownian scaling and discuss how this limits the\npossible conformally invariant random non-self-crossing curves.

This is significant to the geometry of the broad absorption\nline (BAL) outflow. In particular, such an X-ray shield also shields equatorial\naccretion disk winds from the UV, thereby preventing high velocity equatorial\noutflows from being launched. By contrast, bipolar winds initiated by continuum\nradiation pressure from the funnel of a slim accretion disk flare outward (like\na trumpet) and offer vastly different absorbing columns to the X-ray and UV\nemission which are emitted from distinct regions of the disk, $\\sim 6M$ and\n$\\sim 10M-40M$, respectively (where $M$ is the radius of the black hole).\nRecent numerical work indicates that it is also possible to launch bipolar\noutflows from the inner regions of a thin disk. The recent discovery with VLBI\nthat the Galactic analog of a BALQSO, the X-ray binary Circinus X-1 (with high\nvelocity P Cygni X-ray absorption lines) is viewed virtually along the radio\njet axis (and therefore along the spin axis of the black hole and the normal to\nthe accretion disk) has rekindled interest in the bipolar models of BALQSOs. We\nexplore this possibility by studying the nearest BAL QSO, MRK 231. High\nresolution 2-D optical spectroscopy and VLBI mappings of the radio jet axis\nindicates that the BAL outflow is parallel to the parsec scale radio jet.",

The p-test measures the\nconfidence level to which the parameter values corresponding to LCDM are\nexcluded from the viewpoint of the parametrization tested. For example, for a\nlinear equation of state parametrization $w(z)=w_0 + w_1 z$ the LCDM parameter\nvalues ($w_0=-1$, $w_1=0$) are excluded at 75% confidence level. We use a flat\nprior and $\\Omega_{0m}=0.3$. All parametrizations tested are consistent with\nthe Gold dataset at their best fit. According to both statistical tests, the\nworst fits among the 10 parametrizations, correspond to the Chaplygin gas, the\nbrane world and the Cardassian parametrizations. The best fit is achieved by\noscillating parametrizations which can exclude the parameter values\ncorresponding to LCDM at 85% confidence level. Even though this level of\nsignificance does not provide a statistically significant exclusion of LCDM (it\nis less than $2\\sigma$) and does not by itself constitute conclusive evidence\nfor oscillations in the cosmological expansion, when combined with similar\nindependent recent evidence for oscillations coming from the CMB and matter\npower spectra it becomes an issue worth of further investigation.",

The MGC is a\nlocal survey spanning 30.9 sq deg and probing approximately one--two mag/sq\narcsec deeper than either the Two-Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS)\nor the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The MGC contains 10,095 galaxies to\nB_mgc < 20 mag with 96 per cent spectroscopic completeness. We implement a\njoint luminosity-surface brightness step-wise maximum likelihood method to\nrecover the bivariate brightness distribution (BBD) inclusive of most selection\neffects. Integrating the BBD over surface brightness we recover the following\nSchechter function parameters: phi* = (0.0177 +/- 0.0015) h^3 Mpc^{-3}, M_{B}*\n- 5 log h = (-19.60 +/- 0.04) mag and alpha =-1.13 +/- 0.02. Compared to the\n2dFGRS (Norberg et al 2002) we find a consistent M* value but a slightly\nflatter faint-end slope and a higher normalisation, resulting in a final\nluminosity density j_{b_J} = (1.99 +/- 0.17) x 10^8 h L_{odot} Mpc^{-3}.

Although the\nKlein-Nishina effects are well known, the properties of the electron and\nemission spectra have not been studied in detail in the environment of blazars.\nWe solve the kinetic equation of electrons with the spatial escape term of the\nelectrons to obtain the electron energy spectrum in the jet and calculated the\nobserved emission spectrum. In calculations of the Compton losses in the\nKlein-Nishina regime, we use the discrete loss formalism to take into account\nthe significant energy loss in a single scattering. Although the scattering\ncross section decreases because of the Klein-Nishina effects, ample gamma rays\nare emitted by inverse Compton scattering. When the injection spectrum of\nelectrons obeys a power law, the electron spectrum does not follow a broken\npower law, as a result of the Klein-Nishina effects, and a large number of\nhigh-energy electrons remain in the emitting region.",

    "summary": "Flow instability and turbulent transition can be well explained using a new\nproposed theory--Energy gradient theory [1]. In this theory, the stability of a\nflow depends on the relative magnitude of energy gradient in streamwise\ndirection and that in transverse direction, if there is no work input. In this\nnote, it is shown based on the energy gradient theory that inviscid non-uniform\nflow is unstable if the energy in transverse direction is not constant. This\nnew finding breaks the classical linear theory from Rayleigh that inviscid flow\nis unstable if the velocity profile has an inflection point in parallel flows\nand inviscid flow is stable if the velocity profile has no inflection point in\nparallel flow. Then, stability of rotating viscous and inviscid flows is\nstudied, and two examples of rotating flows (rotating rigid body motion and\nfree vortex motion) are shown, respectively.",

All 24 sources were detected and imaged at 5 GHz with a typical dynamic\nrange of 500:1, and 21 of 24 sources were detected and imaged at 15 GHz. Linear\npolarization was detected in 8 sources at both 5 and 15 GHz, allowing for the\ncreation of Faraday rotation measure (RM) images.

    "summary": "The clustering pattern in high redshift HI maps is expected to be anisotropic\ndue to two distinct reasons, the\n  Alcock-Paczynski effect and the peculiar velocities, both of which are\nsensitive to the cosmological parameters. The signal is also expected to be\nsensitive to the details of the HI distribution at the epoch when the radiation\noriginated. We use simple models for the HI distribution at the epoch of\nreionizaation and the post-reionization era to investigate exactly what we hope\nto learn from future observations of the anisotropy pattern in HI maps. We find\nthat such observations will probably tell us more about the HI distribution\nthan about the background cosmological model. Assuming that reionization can be\ndescribed by spherical, ionized bubbles all of the same size with their centers\npossibly being biased with respect to the dark matter, we find that the\nanisotropy pattern at small angles is expected to have a bump at the\ncharacteristic angular size of the individual bubbles whereas the large scale\nanisotropy pattern will reflect the size and the bias of the bubbles. The\nanisotropy also depends on the background cosmological parameters, but the\ndependence is much weaker. Under the assumption that the HI in the\npost-reionization era traces the dark matter with a possible bias, we find that\nchanging the bias and changing the background cosmology has similar effects on\nthe anisotropy pattern. Combining observations of the anisotropy with\nindependent estimates of the bias, possibly from the bi-spectrum, may allow\nthese observations to constrain cosmological parameters.",

For the case of two flavour oscillations,\nP_{ee} has a measurable slope in the 5-8 MeV range but the solar spectrum\nmeasurements in this range find P_{ee} to be flat. The predicted values of\nP_{ee}, even for the best fit value of theta_{sol}, differ by 2 to 3 sigma from\nthe Super-K measured values in each of the three energy bins of the 5-8 MeV\nrange. If future measurements of solar neutrinos by Super-K and SNO find a flat\nspectrum with reduced error bars (by a factor of 2), it will imply that two\nflavour oscillations can no longer explain both KamLAND data and the solar\nspectrum.

From the study of dissipative\nmidperipheral collisions, it has been possible to detect events in which\nIntermediate Mass Fragments (IMF) production takes place. The decay of a\nquasi-projectile has been identified; its excitation energy leads to a\nmultifragmentation totally described in terms of a statistical disassembly of a\nthermalized system (T$\\simeq$4 MeV, E$^*\\simeq$4 MeV/nucleon). Moreover, for\nthe systems Ni+Ni, Ni+Ag, in the same nuclear reaction, a source with velocity\nintermediate between that of the quasi-projectile and that of the quasi-target,\nemitting IMF, is observed. The fragments produced by this source are more\nneutron rich than the average matter of the overall system, and have a charge\ndistribution different, with respect to those statistically emitted from the\nquasi-projectile. The above features can be considered as a signature of the\ndynamical origin of the midvelocity emission. The results of this analysis show\nthat IMF can be produced via different mechanisms simultaneously present within\nthe same collision. Moreover, once fixed the characteristics of the\nquasi-projectile in the three considered reactions (in size, excitation energy\nand temperature), one observes that the probability of a partner IMF production\nvia dynamical mechanism has a threshold (not present in the Ni+Al case) and\nincreases with the size of the target nucleus.",

Assuming that the deposited energy quickly\nthermalizes, we simulate the subsequent hydrodynamic evolution of the QGP\nfluid. For partons moving at supersonic speed, v_p > c_s, and sufficiently\nlarge energy loss, a shock wave forms leading to conical flow [1]. The PHENIX\nCollaboration recently suggested that observed structures in the azimuthal\nangle distribution [2] might be caused by conical flow. We show here that\nconical flow produces different angular structures than predicted in [1] and\nthat, for phenomenologically acceptable values of parton energy loss, conical\nflow effects are too weak to explain the structures seen by PHENIX [2].",

We only consider cosmological models with zero\nspatial curvature. We show that if the quintessence scalar field decays into\ncold dark matter at a rate that brings the ratio of matter to dark energy\nconstant at late times,the cosmological parameters required to fit the CMB data\nare: \\Omega_x = 0.43 \\pm 0.12, baryon fraction \\Omega_b = 0.08 \\pm 0.01, slope\nof the matter power spectrum at large scals n_s = 0.98 \\pm 0.02 and Hubble\nconstant H_0 = 56 \\pm 4 km/s/Mpc. The data prefers a dark energy component with\na dimensionless decay parameter c^2 =0.005 and non-interacting models are\nconsistent with the data only at the 99% confidence level. Using the Bayesian\nInformation Criteria we show that this exra parameter fits the data better than\nmodels with no interaction. The quintessence equation of state parameter is\nless constrained; i.e., the data set an upper limit w_x \\leq -0.86 at the same\nlevel of significance. When the WMAP anisotropy data are combined with\nsupernovae data, the density parameter of dark energy increases to \\Omega_x\n\\simeq 0.68 while c^2 augments to 6.3 \\times 10^{-3}. Models with quintessence\ndecaying into dark matter provide a clean explanation for the coincidence\nproblem and are a viable cosmological model, compatible with observations of\nthe CMB, with testable predictions. Accurate measurements of baryon fraction\nand/or of matter density independent of the CMB data, would support/disprove\nthese models.",

The measured surface spectra at onset are in good\nagreement with the predictions from a linear stability analysis. For the\nnonlinear state our measurements show in a direct manner how energy is\ntransferred from lower to higher harmonics and we quantify the nonlinear\ncoupling coefficients. Furthermore we find that the nonlinear coupling\ngenerates constant components in the spatial Fourier spectrum leading to a\ncontribution of a non oscillating permanent sinusoidal deformed surface state.\nA comparison of a hexagonal and a rectangular pattern reveals that spatial\nresonances only can give rise to a spectrum that violates the temporal\nresonance conditions given by the weakly nonlinear theory.",

The main\nimprovements in the current experiment are a significant suppression of the\nsurface roughness of the Au layers deposited on the interacting surfaces, and a\ndecrease in the experimental error in the measurement of the absolute\nseparation. A metrological analysis of all data permitted us to determine both\nthe random and systematic errors, and to find the total experimental error as a\nfunction of separation at the 95% confidence level. In contrast to all previous\nexperiments on the Casimir effect, our smallest experimental error ($\\sim\n0.5$%) is achieved over a wide separation range. The theoretical Casimir\npressures in the experimental configuration were calculated by the use of four\ntheoretical approaches suggested in the literature. All corrections to the\nCasimir force were calculated or estimated. All theoretical errors were\nanalyzed and combined to obtain the total theoretical error at the 95%\nconfidence level. Finally, the confidence interval for the differences between\ntheoretical and experimental pressures was obtained as a function of\nseparation. Our measurements are found to be consistent with two theoretical\napproaches utilizing the plasma model and the surface impedance over the entire\nmeasurement region. Two other approaches to the thermal Casimir force,\nutilizing the Drude model or a special prescription for the determination of\nthe zero-frequency contribution to the Lifshitz formula, are excluded on the\nbasis of our measurements at the 99% and 95% confidence levels, respectively.\nFinally, constraints on Yukawa-type hypothetical interactions are strengthened\nby up to a factor of 20 in a wide interaction range.",

In\nparticular, we describe the coupling of the supergravity multiplet to the\nlowest massive spin-3/2 multiplet which contains 256 physical degrees of\nfreedom and includes the moduli of the theory. The effective theory is realized\nas the broken phase of a particular gauging of the maximal three-dimensional\nsupergravity with gauge group SO(4) x SO(4).

Based on extensive radiative transfer modelling of both\nCO line emission and dust continuum radiation for all objects with known\ndetached molecular shells, we present compelling evidence that these shells\nshow clear signs of interaction with a surrounding medium. The derived masses\nof the shells increase with radial distance from the central star while their\nvelocities decrease. A simple model for interacting winds indicate that the\nmass-loss rate producing the faster moving wind has to be almost two orders of\nmagnitudes higher (~10^-5 solar masses per year) than the slower AGB wind (a\nfew 10^-7 solar masses per year) preceding this violent event. At the same\ntime, the present-day mass-loss rates are very low indicating that the epoch of\nhigh mass-loss rate was relatively short, on the order of a few hundred years.\nThis, together with the number of sources exhibiting this phenomenon, suggests\na connection with He-shell flashes (thermal pulses). We report the detection of\na detached molecular shell around the carbon star DR Ser, as revealed from new\nsingle-dish CO (sub-)millimetre line observations. The properties of the shell\nare similar to those characterising the young shell around U Cam.",

However, unlike its FE analogue, the\nconventional BaTiO3 based IBLC ceramics, our samples showed weaker temperature\ndependence of relative permittivity which spans over a wide temperature range.\nA Maxwell-Wagner type relaxation in the FE state was observed. Moreover,\nanother relaxation mode appears from the vicinity of FE phase transition\ntemperature TC, and extends over a narrow temperature range, with unusual\nslowing down of relaxation rate as temperature rises, which is contrary to what\nis commonly observed.

Nine pointings were observed with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio\nTelescope to determine the physical parameters of these objects and to find\nclues to their origin. One additional pointing was directed at a similar object\nnear M33. At 2' resolution we detect 16 individual HVCs around M31 and 1 HVC\nnear M33 with typical HI masses of a few times 10^5 solar masses and sizes of\nthe order of 1 kpc. Estimates of the dynamical and virial masses of some of the\nHVCs indicate that they are likely gravitationally dominated by additional mass\ncomponents such as dark matter or ionised gas. Twelve of the clouds are\nconcentrated in an area of only 1 by 1 degree at a projected separation of less\nthan 15 kpc from the disk of M31. This HVC complex has a rather complicated\nmorphological and kinematical structure and partly overlaps with the giant\nstellar stream of M31, suggesting a tidal origin. Another detected feature is\nin close proximity, in both position and velocity, with NGC 205, perhaps also\nindicative of tidal processes. Other HVCs in our survey are isolated and might\nrepresent primordial, dark-matter dominated clouds.",

    "summary": "In 1971 Feynman, Kislinger and Ravndal [1] proposed Lorentz-invariant\ndifferential equation capable to describe relativistic particle with mass and\ninternal space-time structure. By making use of new variables that\ndifferentiate between space-time particle position and its space-time\nseparations, one finds this wave equation to become separable and providing the\ntwo kinds of solutions endowed with different physical meanings. The first kind\nconstitutes the running waves that represent Klein-Gordon-like particle. The\nsecond kind, widely discussed by Kim and Noz [4], constitutes standing waves\nwhich are normalizable space-time wave functions. To fully appreciate how\nvaluable theses solutions are it seems necessarily, however, to verify a\ngeneral outlook on relativity issue that (still) is in force. It was explained\n[5] that Lorentz symmetry should be perceived rather as the symmetry of\npreferred frame quantum description (based on the freedom of choice of\ncomparison scale) than classical Galilean idea realized in a generalized form.\nCurrently we point to some basic consequences that relate to solutions of\nFeynman equation framed in the new approach. In particular (i) Lorentz symmetry\ngroup appears to describe energy-dependent geometry of extended quantum objects\ninstead of relativity of space and time measure, (ii) a new picture of\nparticle-wave duality involving running and standing waves emerges, (iii)\nspace-time localized quantum states are shown to provide a new way of\ndescription of particle kinematics, and (iv) proposed by Witten [14]\ngeneralized form of Heisenberg uncertainty relation is derived and shown be the\nintegral part of overall non-orthodox approach.",

    "summary": "The semileptonic decays of Lambda_c and Lambda_b are treated in the framework\nof a constituent quark model. Both nonrelativistic and semirelativistic\nHamiltonians are used to obtain the baryon wave functions from a fit to the\nspectra, and the wave functions are expanded in both the harmonic oscillator\nand Sturmian bases. The latter basis leads to form factors in which the\nkinematic dependence on q^2 is in the form of multipoles, and the resulting\nform factors fall faster as a function of q^2 in the available kinematic\nranges. As a result, decay rates obtained in the two models using the Sturmian\nbasis are significantly smaller than those obtained using the harmonic\noscillator basis. In the case of the Lambda_c, decay rates calculated using the\nSturmian basis are closer to the experimentally reported rates. However, we\nfind a semileptonic branching fraction for the Lambda_c to decay to excited\nLambda* states of 11% to 19%, in contradiction with what is assumed in\navailable experimental analyses. Our prediction for the Lambda_b semileptonic\ndecays is that decays to the ground state Lambda_c provide a little less than\n70% of the total semileptonic decay rate. For the decays Lambda_b to Lambda_c,\nthe analytic form factors we obtain satisfy the relations expected from\nheavy-quark effective theory at the non-recoil point, at leading and\nnext-to-leading orders in the heavy-quark expansion. In addition, some features\nof the heavy-quark limit are shown to naturally persist as the mass of the\nheavy quark in the daughter baryon is decreased.",

We find that\nthe quadrupole moment of point-particle binaries in harmonic coordinates\ncontains a pole when epsilon = d-3 -> 0 at the 3PN order. It is proved that the\npole can be renormalized away by means of the same shifts of the particle\nworld-lines as in our recent derivation of the 3PN equations of motion. The\nresulting renormalized (finite when epsilon -> 0) quadrupole moment leads to\nunique values for the ambiguity parameters xi, kappa and zeta, which were\nintroduced in previous computations using Hadamard's regularization. Several\nchecks of these values are presented.

The final flux state of each ring in the\narrays was determined using scanning SQUID microscopy. In the 1D arrays,\nfabricated as a single junction with facets alternating between alignment\nparallel to a [100] axis of the YBCO and rotated 90 degrees to that axis,\nhalf-fluxon Josephson vortices order strongly into an arrangement with\nalternating signs of their magnetic flux. We demonstrate that this ordering is\ndriven by phase coupling and model the cooling process with a numerical\nsolution of the Sine-Gordon equation. The 2D ring arrays couple to each other\nthrough the magnetic flux generated by the spontaneous supercurrents. Using\npi-rings for the 2D flux coupling experiments eliminates one source of disorder\nseen in similar experiments using conventional superconducting rings, since\npi-rings have doubly degenerate ground states in the absence of an applied\nfield. Although anti-ferromagnetic ordering occurs, with larger negative bond\norders than previously reported for arrays of conventional rings, long-range\norder is never observed, even in geometries without geometric frustration.

This situation changes abruptly if one turns on the Chern-Simons\nterm for the Maxwell field. First, the flux integral at infinity becomes equal\nto the topological charge. Second, demanding regularity of the black hole\nhorizon, it is found that the Coulomb charge (whose associated potential now\ndecays by a power law) must vanish identically. Hence, in 2+1 topologically\nmassive electrodynamics coupled to gravity, the black hole can only support\nholonomies for the Maxwell field. This means that the charged black hole, as\nthe uncharged one, is constructed from the vacuum by means of spacetime\nidentifications.",

The\ndirac mass does not affect the so-called \"UV insensitivity\" of the other soft\nparameters to running or supersymmetric thresholds and thus flavor physics at\nintermediate scales would not reintroduce the flavor problem.

Two-parameter fits in the spectral and\nredshift evolution indices show that a standard Fermi $E_i^{-2}$ source\nspectrum is excluded at larger than 95% confidence level (CL). Armed with the\nprimordial emissivity, we follow Waxman and Bahcall to derive the associated\nneutrino flux on the basis of optically thin sources. For $pp$ interactions as\nthe generating mechanism, the neutrino flux exceeds the AMANDA-B10 90%CL upper\nlimits. In the case of $p\\gamma$ dominance, the flux is marginally consistent\nwith AMANDA-B10 data. In the new scenario the source neutrino flux dominates\nover the cosmogenic flux at all energies. Thus, should data from AMANDA-II\nprove consistent with the model, we show that IceCube can measure the\ncharacteristic power law of the neutrino spectrum, and thus provide a window on\nthe source dynamics.",

We use 50 smooth continuum fitted quasar spectra\n(0.14 < z < 1.04) taken by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Faint Object\nSpectrograph. Three weak emission lines in the Ly alpha forest are identified\nas FeII 1070.95A, FeII+FeIII 1123.17A, and CIII* 1175.88A.

By actively using PCS, we can generate artificial quasar spectra which\nare useful to test the detection of quasars, DLAs, and the continuum\ncalibration. We provide 10,000 artificially generated spectra. We show that the\npower-law extrapolated continuum is inadequate to perform precise measurements\nof the mean flux in the Ly alpha forest because of the weak emission lines and\nthe extended tails of Ly alpha and Ly beta/OVI emission lines.

This survey encompasses 324 arcmin^2 to an rms\nnoise level (filtered for point sources) of 1.4 mJy/beam and includes the\nentire regions surveyed by the published 8 mJy 850 micron JCMT SCUBA and 1.2 mm\nIRAM MAMBO surveys.

In total, 17 source candidates were\ndetected at a significance > 3.0 sigma, with six expected false detections.\nNine candidates are new detections, while eight candidates have coincident\nSCUBA 850 micron and/or MAMBO 1.2 mm detections. From our observed number\ncounts, we estimate the underlying differential number count distribution of\nsubmillimeter galaxies and find it to be in general agreement with previous\nsurveys.

Just as in the flat space case,\nin a completely vector-like gauge theory defined after discretizing this extra\ndimension, the spectrum contains a very light charged fermion whose chiral\ncomponents are localized at the ends of the extra dimensional interval. The\ncomponent on the IR boundary of the AdS space can be given a large mass by\ncoupling it to a neutral fermion via the Higgs mechanism. In this theory, gauge\ninvariance can be restored either by taking the limit of infinite proper length\nof the extra dimension or by reducing the AdS curvature radius towards zero. In\nthe latter case, the Kaluza-Klein modes stay heavy and the resulting classical\ntheory approaches a chiral gauge theory, as we verify numerically. Potential\ndifficulties for this approach could arise from the coupling of the\nlongitudinal mode of the light gauge boson, which has to be treated\nnon-perturbatively.",

With increasing\ncoupling strength, we show that the stress on the superfluid phase to\naccommodate a number asymmetry increases. Near the infinite-scattering length\nlimit, we calculate the single-particle excitation spectrum and the\nground-state energy at various polarizations. A picture of weakly-interacting\nquasi-particles emerges for modest polarizations. In this regime near infinite\nscattering length, and for modest polarizations, a homogeneous phase with a\nfinite population of excited quasi-particle states characterized by a gapless\nspectrum should be favored over the phase separated state.

The time evolution of the Lorentz factor of the shock\nfront is assumed to follow a power law when the time is measured from the\nmoment at which the shock front reaches the surface. The power index is found\nto be determined by the condition for the flow to extend through a critical\npoint.

In each case, a constrained form of the Tsallis entropy\nfunction exists, which at q=1 reduces to its Shannon equivalent. Since they are\nfully constrained, each constrained Tsallis function can be \"dismembered\" to\ngive its partial or local form, providing the means to independently examine\neach state i relative to its local stationary (maximum entropy) position. The\nMark II and III functions depend on q, the probability, the stationary\nprobability, and the respective q-partition function; in contrast the Mark I\nform depends only on the first three parameters.

For structures in which the\nfast electrons are predominantly backscattered, the Lorentz force assists in\nthe transport producing an initial increase of the corresponding oscillation\namplitude. Furthermore, we discuss the effect of elastic scattering on a\npotential cavity within one of the arms of the ring. For the cavity tuned to\nshift maximally the phase of the maximum of the wave packet we observe a $\\pi$\nshift of the Aharonov-Bohm oscillations. For other cavity depths the\noscillations with a period of half of the flux quantum are observed.",

    "summary": "Two hypothesizes concerning interaction of neutrons with nanoparticles and\nhaving applications in the physics of ultracold neutron (UCN) were recently\nconsidered in ref. [Physics of Atomic Nuclei 65(3): 400 (2002)]; they were\nmotivated by the experimental observation of small changes in energy of UCN\nupon their collisions with surface. The first hypothesis explaines the nature\nof the observed phenomenon by inelastic coherent scattering of UCN on\nnanoparticles weakly attached at surface, in a state of permanent thermal\nmotion. It got experimental confirmed in ref. [Physics of Atomic Nuclei 65(11):\n1996 (2002)]. The second hypothesis inverts the problem of neutron interaction\nwith nanoparticles in the following sence. In all experiments with UCN, the\ntrap-wall temperature was much higher than a temperature of about 1 mK, which\ncorresponds to the UCN energy. Therefore, UCN preferentially increased their\nenergy. The surface density of weakly attached nanoparticles was low. If,\nhowever, the nanoparticles temperature is lower than the neutron temperature\nand if the nanoparticles density is high, the problem of interaction of\nneutrons with nanoparticles is inverted. In this case, the neutrons can cool\ndown, under certain conditions, owing tot heir scattering on\nultracold-heavy-water, deuterium, and oxigen nanoparticles to their temperature\nof about 1 mK, with result that the UCN density increases by many orders of\nmagnitude. In the present article we repeat the argumentation given in the\nfirst mentioned article and formulate in a very general way the research\nprogram in order to verify validity of this hypothesis. Both the theoretical\nand the experimental investigation of the problem are going to intensify in the\nnear future.",

A\nlarge temperature-induced and wavelength-dependent frequency shift of the\nphonon frequency is observed, of which only a small fraction can be associated\nwith the thermal volume change. The main contribution to the temperature\ndependence of the phonon frequency is rather attributed to non-adiabatic\neffects in the electron-phonon interaction, which explains also the observation\nof an increasing phonon line width upon cooling.

In such a way the complicated transport problem is\nreduced to a set of M first order integro-differential equations in time, which\ncan be solved efficiently by the algorithm presented here. The workings of the\nmethod have been demonstrated on a couple of examples: networks involving\nthree, four and seven containers, and one network with a three-point junction.\nAlready simple networks with relatively few containers exhibit interesting\ntransport behavior.

    "summary": "The Rieger periods are solar cycles with a time scale of months, which are\npresent in both flaring activity and sunspot occurrence. These short-term\nperiodicities, tentatively explained by equatorially trapped Rossby-type waves\nmodulating the emergence of magnetic flux at the surface, are considered a\npeculiar and not yet fully understood solar phenomenon. We chose a stellar\nsystem with solar characteristics, UX Arietis, and performed a timing analysis\nof two 9-year datasets of radio and optical observations. The analysis reveals\na 294-day cycle. When the two 9-year datasets are folded with this period, a\nsynchronization of the peak of the optical light curve (i.e., the minimum spot\ncoverage) with the minimum radio flaring activity is observed. This close\nrelationship between two completly independent curves makes it very likely that\nthe 294-day cycle is real. We conclude that the process invoked for the Sun of\na periodical emergence of magnetic flux may also be applied to UX Arietis and\ncan explain the cyclic flaring activity triggered by interactions between\nsuccessive cyclic emergences of magnetic flux.",

We then calculate an effective\naction for $N$ D-instantons by integrating out one D-instanton (which we call a\nmean-field D-instanton) with an appropriate wave function and show that various\nterms can be induced corresponding to the choice of the wave functions. In\nparticular, a Chern-Simons-like term is induced when the mean-field D-instanton\nhas a wave function of the antisymmetric tensor field. A fuzzy sphere becomes a\nclassical solution to the equation of motion for the effective action.\n  We also give an interpretation of the above wave functions from the string\ntheory side as overlaps of the D-instanton boundary state with closed string\nmassless states in the Green-Schwarz formalism.",

Bo 158 was the first dipping LMXB to be discovered in M31. Periodic\nintensity dips were previously seen to occur on a 2.78-hr period, due to\nabsorption in material that is raised out of the plane of the accretion disc.\nThe report of these observations stated that the dip depth was anti-correlated\nwith source intensity. However, our new observations do not favour a strict\nintensity dependance, but rather suggest that the dip variation is due to\nprecession of the accretion disc. This is to be expected in LMXBs with a mass\nratio <~ 0.3 (period <~ 4 hr), as the disc reaches the 3:1 resonance with the\nbinary companion, causing elongation and precession of the disc. A smoothed\nparticle hydrodynamics simulation of the disc in this system shows retrograde\nrotation of a disc warp on a period of ~11 P_orb, and prograde disc precession\non a period of ~29 P_orb. This is consistent with the observed variation in the\ndepth of the dips. We find that the dipping behaviour is most likely to be\nmodified by the disc precession, hence we predict that the dipping behaviour\nrepeats on a 81+/-3 hr cycle.",

Ionization in liquid helium results in the copious production of\nmetastable helium molecules, which can be detected by laser-induced\nfluorescence.

Although the\napproximation is not controlled by a small parameter, its accuracy can be\nsystematically improved.

The method is to construct the partition function in terms of the\nFeynman evolution kernel in the Euclidean time variable associated with the\ncoordinate normal to the surfaces defining the layered structure. The theory is\napplicable to cylindrical systems and its development is motivated by the\npossibility that a static van der Waals or thermal Casimir force could provide\nan attractive force stabilising a dielectric tube formed from a lipid bilayer,\nan example of which are t-tubules occurring in certain muscle cells. In this\ncontext, we apply the theory to the calculation of the thermal Casimir effect\nfor a dielectric tube of radius $R$ and thickness $\\delta$ formed from such a\nmembrane in water. In a grand canonical approach we find that the leading\ncontribution to the Casimir energy behaves like $-k_BTL\\kappa_C/R$ which gives\nrise to an attractive force which tends to contract the tube radius. We find\nthat $\\kappa_C \\sim 0.3$ for the case of typical lipid membrane t-tubules. We\nconclude that except in the case of a very soft membrane this force is\ninsufficient to stabilise such tubes against the bending stress which tend to\nincrease the radius.

For metal\nnanoparticle ensembles, we show analytically and numerically that femtosecond\nsecond- or third-harmonic-generation (THG) experiments together with linear\nextinction measurements generally do not allow to determine the homogeneous\nlinewidth. This is in contrast to claims of previous work in which we identify\na technical mistake. For metallic photonic crystal slabs, we introduce a simple\nclassical model of two coupled Lorentz oscillators, corresponding to the\nplasmon and waveguide modes. This model describes very well the key\nexperimental features of linear optics, particularly the Fano-like lineshapes.\nThe derived nonlinear-optical THG spectra are shown to depend on the underlying\nsource of the optical nonlinearity. We present corresponding THG experiments\nwith metallic photonic crystal slabs. In contrast to previous work, we\nspectrally resolve the interferometric THG signal, and we additionally obtain a\nhigher temporal resolution by using 5 fs laser pulses. In the THG spectra, the\ndistinct spectral components exhibit strongly different behaviors versus time\ndelay. The measured spectra agree well with the model calculations.",

However, the implied constraints also require the\nfield change in the atmosphere to be so small that it has only a tiny dynamical\neffect on p-mode frequencies. For p-modes, the most plausible explanation of\nthe frequency increase is a less than 2 percent decrease in the radial\ncomponent of the turbulent velocity in the outer layers.

Different solutions\nsuch as left- and right-going solitons are classified according to the\nsymmetries of the 5th roots of exp(i epsilon). Furthermore, we show that the\nsoliton solutions of the n-reduction of the BKP and CKP hierarchies with n= 2 j\n+1, j=1, 2, 3, ..., can propagate along j directions in the 1+1 space-time\ndomain. Each such direction corresponds to one symmetric distribution of the\nnth roots of exp(i epsilon). Based on this classification, we detail the\nexistence of two-peak solitons of the n-reduction from the Grammian tau\nfunction of the sub-hierarchies BKP and CKP. If n is even, we again find\ntwo-peak solitons. Last, we obtain the \"stationary\" soliton for the\nhigher-order KP hierarchy.",

Different modes of adiabatic phonons are added to the\nHamiltonian:breathing, shear and half-breathing modes. Diagonal and\noff-diagonal electron-phonon couplings are considered. It is observed that\nstrong diagonal EPI generate stripes in previously homogeneous states, while in\nstriped ground states an increase in the diagonal couplings tends to stabilize\nthe stripes, inducing a gap in the density of states (DOS) and rendering the\nground state insulating. The off-diagonal terms, on the other hand, destabilize\nthe stripes creating inhomogeneous ground states with a pseudogap at the\nchemical potential in the DOS. The breathing mode stabilizes static diagonal\nstripes; while the half-breathing (shear) modes stabilize dynamical (localized)\nvertical and horizontal stripes.

One of those\nis a degeneration of the_commuting variety_ of pairs of commuting matrices.\n  The_Brauer loop model_ is a quantum integrable stochastic process introduced\nin [de Gier--Nienhuis '04], and some of the entries of its Perron-Frobenius\neigenvector were observed (conjecturally) to match the degrees of the\ncomponents of the upper-upper scheme.

In that paper, the entries of the Perron-Frobenius eigenvector were\ngeneralized from numbers to polynomials, which allowed them to be calculated\ninductively using divided difference operators.

    "summary": "Embedding a double barrier resonant tunnelling diode (RTD) in an unipolar\nInGaAlAs optical waveguide gives rise to a very low driving voltage\nelectroabsorption modulator (EAM) at optical wavelengths around 1550 nm. The\npresence of the RTD within the waveguide core introduces high non-linearity and\nnegative differential resistance in the current-voltage (I-V) characteristic of\nthe waveguide. This makes the electric field distribution across the waveguide\ncore strongly dependent on the bias voltage: when the current decreases from\nthe peak to the valley there is an increase of the electric field across the\ndepleted core. The electric field enhancement in the core-depleted layer causes\nthe Franz-Keldysh absorption band-edge to red shift, which is responsible for\nthe electroabsorption effect. High frequency ac signals as low as 100 mV can\ninduce electric field high speed switching, producing substantial light\nmodulation (up to 15 dB) at photon energies slightly lower than the waveguide\ncore band-gap energy. The key difference between this device and conventional\np-i-n EAMs is that the tunnelling characteristics of the RTD are employed to\nswitch the electric field across the core depleted region; the RTDEAM has in\nessence an integrated electronic amplifier and therefore requires considerably\nless switching power.",

Recently, some authors raised the question as to\nwhether post-processing the Fourier spectrum by measuring in a random\northonormal basis helps for solving the HSP. Several negative results on the\nshortcomings of this random strong method are known. In this paper however, we\nshow that the random strong method can be quite powerful under certain\nconditions on the group G. We define a parameter r(G) for a group G and show\nthat O((\\log |G| / r(G))^2) iterations of the random strong method give enough\nclassical information to identify a hidden subgroup in G. We illustrate the\npower of the random strong method via a concrete example of the HSP over finite\nHeisenberg groups. We show that r(G) = \\Omega(1) for these groups; hence the\nHSP can be solved using polynomially many random strong Fourier samplings\nfollowed by a possibly exponential classical post-processing without further\nqueries. The quantum part of our algorithm consists of a polynomial computation\nfollowed by measuring in a random orthonormal basis. This gives the first\nexample of a group where random representation bases do help in solving the HSP\nand for which no explicit representation bases are known that solve the problem\nwith (\\log G)^O(1) Fourier samplings.

    "summary": "The recently emerging conviction that thick disks are prevalent in disk\ngalaxies, and their seemingly ubiquitous old ages, means that the formation of\nthe thick disk, perhaps more than any other component, holds the key to\nunravelling the evolution of the Milky Way, and indeed all disk galaxies. In\nPaper I, we proposed that the thick disk was formed in an epoch of gas rich\nmergers, at high redshift. This hypothesis was based on comparing N-body/SPH\nsimulations to a variety of Galactic and extragalactic observations, including\nstellar kinematics, ages and chemical properties.Here examine our thick disk\nformation scenario in light of the most recent observations of extragalactic\nthick disks. In agreement, our simulted thick disks are old and relatively\nmetal rich, with V-I colors that do not vary significantly with distance from\nthe plane. Further, we show that our proposal results in an enhancement of\nalpha-elements in thick disk stars as compared with thin disk stars, consistent\nwith observations of the relevant populations of the Milky Way. We also find\nthat our scenario naturally leads to the formation of an old metal weak stellar\nhalo population with high alpha-element abundances.",

Previous radio\nobservations did not detect any radio emission coming from the interior of the\nX-ray holes. We present new low frequency radio observations of Abell 2597. At\n330 MHz, radio emission extends into the interior of the western ghost bubble,\nbut not the northeast one. Our re-analysis of the archival Chandra data shows\nevidence for an X-ray tunnel (elongated region of reduced X-ray emission)\nextending from near the center of the cD out to the west ghost bubble. We also\ndetect a smaller X-ray hole to the northeast of the center of the cD and closer\nthan the outer ghost bubbles. Radio observations at 1.3 GHz show extensions to\nthe west along the X-ray tunnel toward the west ghost bubble, to the northeast\ninto the new X-ray hole, and to the northwest. All of these structures are much\nlarger than the two inner radio lobes seen previously at 8 GHz. The X-ray\ntunnel suggests that the west ghost bubble is part of a continuous flow of\nradio plasma out from the active galactic nucleus, rather than a detached\nbuoyant old radio lobe, and thus it may be an intermediate case between an\nactive radio galaxy and a buoyant lobe.",

This\nmodel has an anisotropic limit, when the dimensionless ratio of two exchange\nconstants, J_\\times/J << 1, in which it consists of one-dimensional spin chains\ncoupled weakly together in a frustrated fashion. Using recently developed\ntechniques combining renormalization group ideas and one-dimensional\nbosonization and current algebra methods, we show that in this limit the model\nenters a crossed dimer state with two-fold spontaneous symmetry breaking but no\nmagnetic order. We complement this result by an approximate ``quadrumer triplet\nboson'' calculation, which qualitatively captures the physics of the\n``plaquette valence bond solid'' state believed to obtain for J_\\times/J = 1.\nUsing these known points in parameter space, the instabilities pointed to by\nthe quadrumer boson calculation, and the simple limit J_\\times/J >> 1, we\nconstruct a few candidate global phase diagrams for the model, and discuss the\nnature of the quantum phase transitions contained therein.

    "summary": "Pulsars are rapidly rotating neutron stars and are the outcome of the\ncollapse of the core of a massive star with a mass of the order of or larger\nthan eight solar masses. This process releases a huge gravitational energy of\nabout 10^{53} erg, mainly in the form of neutrinos. During the collapse the\ndensity increases, and so does the magnetic field due to the trapping of the\nflux lines of the progenitor star by the high conductivity plasma. When the\ndensity reaches a value of around 10^{12} g cm^{-3} neutrinos become trapped\nwithin the protoneutron star and a neutrinosphere, characterized inside by a\ndiffusive transport of neutrinos and outside by a free streaming of neutrinos,\nis formed and lasts for a few seconds. Here we focus on the structure of the\nneutrinosphere, the resonant flavor conversion that can happen in its interior,\nand the neutrino flux anisotropies induced by this phenomena in the presence of\na strong magnetic field. We present a detailed discussion in the context of the\nspherical Eddington model, which provides a simple but reasonable description\nof a static neutrino atmosphere, locally homogenous and isotropic. Energy and\nmomentum are transported by neutrinos and antineutrinos flowing through an\nideal gas of nonrelativistic, nondegenerate nucleons and relativistic,\ndegenerate electrons and positrons. We examine the details of the asymmetric\nneutrino emission driven by active-sterile neutrino oscillations in the\nmagnetized protoneutron star, and the possibility for this mechanism to explain\nthe intrinsic large velocities of pulsars respect to nearby stars and\nassociated supernova remnants.",

Using this description, we make predictions about\nturbulent flow in a rapidly rotating laboratory annulus. Measurements on the\ncontinuously forced, weakly dissipative flow reveal coherent vortices in a mean\nzonal flow. Statistical mechanics has two crucial requirements for equilibrium:\nstatistical independence of macro-cells (subsystems) and additivity of\ninvariants of macro-cells. We use additivity to select the appropriate Casimir\ninvariants from the infinite set available in vortex dynamics, and we do this\nin such a way that the exchange of micro-cells within a macro-cell does not\nalter an invariant of a macro-cell. A novel feature of the present study is our\nchoice of macro-cells, which are continuous phase space curves based on mean\nvalues of the streamfunction. Quantities such as energy and enstrophy can be\ndefined on each curve, and these lead to a local canonical distribution that is\nalso defined on each curve. Our approach leads to the prediction that on a mean\nstreamfunction curve there should be a linear relation between the\nensemble-averaged potential vorticity and the time-averaged streamfunction, and\nour laboratory data are in good accord with this prediction. Further, the\napproach predicts that although the probability distribution function for\npotential vorticity in the entire system is non-Gaussian, the distribution\nfunction of micro-cells should be Gaussian on the macro-cells, i.e., for curves\ndefined by mean values of the streamfunction. This prediction is also supported\nby the data. While the statistical mechanics approach used was motivated by and\napplied to experiments on turbulence in a rotating annulus, the approach is\nquite general and is applicable to a large class of Hamiltonian systems.",

The\ncriterion defining the bound species is not arbitrary; i.e., the cutoff\nseparation distance in the configuration integral used to calculate K arises\ndirectly from the definition of W. For a one-component dense fluid, W permits\nthe derivation of the phase-condensation temperature, which for a gas is the\ncritical temperature and for a liquid the freezing temperature. For ionic A and\nB (e.g., Sodium and Chloride ions in molten NaCl), an expression for the\nfreezing temperature is obtained, which is similar to the expression for the\nmelting temperature derived by Kosterlitz and Thouless for two-dimensional\nsystems.",

The method entails choosing\na large of pairs of foreground lens galaxies and constructing a mean shear map\nwith respect to their axis, by averaging the ellipticities of background source\ngalaxies. An average mass map can be reconstructed from this shear map and this\nwill represent the average mass distribution around pairs of galaxies. We show\nhow this mass map is related to the projected galaxy-galaxy-mass three-point\ncorrelation function. Using a large N-body dark matter simulation populated\nwith galaxies using the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) bias prescription,\nwe compute these correlation functions, mass maps, and shear maps. The\nresultant mass maps are distinctly bimodal, tracing the galaxy centers and\nremaining anisotropic up to scales much larger than the galaxy separation. At\nlarger scales, the shear is approximately tangential about the center of the\npair but with small azimuthal variation in amplitude. We estimate the\nsignal-to-noise ratio of the reconstructed mass maps for a survey of similar\ndepth to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and conclude that the\ngalaxy-galaxy-mass three-point function should be measurable with the current\nSDSS weak lensing data. Measurements of this three-point function, along with\ngalaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy auto-correlation functions, will provide new\nconstraints on galaxy bias models. The anisotropic shear profile around close\npairs of galaxies is a prediction of cold dark matter models and may be\ndifficult to reconcile with alternative theories of gravity without dark\nmatter.",

    "summary": "We study thick brane world models as Z_2-symmetric domain walls supported by\na scalar field with an arbitrary potential V(\\phi) in 5D general relativity.\nUnder the global regularity requirement, such configurations (i) have always an\nAdS asymptotic far from the brane, (ii) are only possible if V(\\phi) has an\nalternating sign and (iii) V(\\phi) should satisfy a certain fine-tuning type\nequality. Thus a thick brane with any admissible V(\\phi) is a regularized\nversion of the RS2 brane immersed in the AdS_5 bulk. The thin brane limit is\nrealized in a universal manner by including an arbitrary thick brane model in a\none-parameter family, where the parameter \"a\" is associated with brane\nthickness; the asymptotic value of V(\\phi) (related to \\Lambda_5, the effective\ncosmological constant) remains a-independent. The problem of ordinary matter\nconfinement on the brane is discussed for a test scalar field. Its\nstress-energy tensor is found to diverge at the AdS horizon for both thin and\nthick branes, making a serious problem for this class of brane world models.",

The globular cluster luminosity function can be followed\nroughly 1 mag beyond the turn-over magnitude. This corresponds to a distance\nmodulus of m-M=31.24+-0.17, 0.4 mag larger than the distance determined from\nsurface brightness fluctuations. The high specific frequency is confirmed, yet\nthe exact value remains uncertain because of the uncertain distance: it varies\nbetween 5.6+-1.2 and 8.9+-1.2. The globular cluster system has a clearly\nbimodal color distribution. The color peak positions show no radial dependence\nand are in good agreement with the values found for other galaxies studied in\nthe same filter system. However, a luminosity dependence is found: brighter\nclusters with an ``intermediate'' color exist. The clusters exhibit a shallow\nradial distribution within 7'.Within the same radial interval, the galaxy light\nhas a distinctly steeper profile. Because of the difference in the cluster and\nlight distribution the specific frequency increases considerably with radius.\nAt 7' and 9' the density profiles of the red and blue clusters, respectively,\nchange strongly which indicates that we reach the outer rim of the cluster\nsystem at approximately 11'. This feature is seen for the first time in a\nglobular cluster system. While the radial distribution of the cluster and field\npopulations are rather different, this is not true for the ellipticity of the\nsystem: the elongation as well as the position angle of the cluster system\nagree well with the galaxy light. We compare the radial distribution of\nglobular clusters with the light profiles for a sample of elliptical galaxies.\nThe difference observed in NGC 4636 is typical of an elliptical galaxy of this\nluminosity.",

The significant temporal\nPSF variations on timescales of minutes inhibited a straightforward scaled PSF\nremoval from the quasar images.

It was followed\nby a very bright, fading radio afterglow. Extensive follow-up radio\nobservations provided a wealth of information with unprecedented astrometric\nprecision, revealing the temporal evolution of the source size, along with\ndensely sampled light curves and spectra. Here we expand on our previous work\non this source, by explaining these observations within one self-consistent\ndynamical model. In this scenario, the early radio emission is due to the\noutflow ejected during the GF energizing a thin shell surrounding a\npre-existing cavity, where the observed steep temporal decay of the radio\nemission seen beginning on day 9 is attributed to the adiabatic cooling of the\nshocked shell. The shocked ejecta and external shell move outward together,\ndriving a forward shock into the ambient medium, and are eventually decelerated\nby a reverse shock. As we show in Gelfand et al. (2005), the radio emission\nfrom the shocked external medium naturally peaks when significant deceleration\noccurs, and then decays relatively slowly. The dynamical modeling of the\ncollision between the ejecta and the external shell together with the observed\nevolution of the source size (which is nicely reproduced in our model) suggest\nthat most of the energy in the outflow was in mildly relativistic material,\nwith an initial expansion velocity $v/c \\lesssim 0.7d_{15}$, for a distance of\n$15d_{15}$ kpc to SGR 1806-20. An initially highly relativistic outflow would\nnot have produced a long coasting phase at a mildly relativistic expansion\nvelocity, as was observed.",

The majority of the AGNs in our sample (155\nobjects) have been selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) in an\nunbiased way, rendering the sample results representative of all SDSS AGNs. The\naddition of two heterogeneous samples of 36 high-redshift and 37 low-redshift\nAGNs further supports and extends our conclusions. We confirm that the X-ray\nemission from AGNs is correlated with their UV emission, and that the ratio of\nthe monochromatic luminosity emitted at 2keV compared to 2500A decreases with\nincreasing luminosity (a_ox=-0.136 l_uv+2.616, where l_uv is in log units), but\ndoes not change with cosmic time. These results apply to intrinsic AGN\nemission, as we correct or control for the effects of the host galaxy, UV/X-ray\nabsorption, and any X-ray emission associated with radio emission in AGNs. We\ninvestigate a variety of systematic errors and can thereby state with\nconfidence that (1) the a_ox-l_uv anti-correlation is real and not a result of\naccumulated systematic errors and (2) any a_ox dependence on redshift is\nnegligible in comparison.

HD-line cooling dominates the thermal balance of clouds when Z\n\\~ 10^{-5}-10^{-3} Z_sun and density ~10^{5} cm^{-3}. Early on, CMB radiation\nprevents the gas temperature to fall below T_CMB, although this hardly alters\nthe cloud thermal evolution in low-metallicity gas. From the derived\ntemperature evolution, we assess cloud/core fragmentation as a function of\nmetallicity from linear perturbation theory, which requires that the core\nelongation E := (b-a)/a > E_NL ~ 1, where a (b) is the short (long) core axis\nlength. The fragment mass is given by the thermal Jeans mass at E = E_NL. Given\nthese assumptions and the initial (gaussian) distribution of E we compute the\nfragment mass distribution as a function of metallicity. We find that: (i) For\nZ=0, all fragments are very massive, > 10^{3}M_sun, consistently with previous\nstudies; (ii) for Z>10^{-6} Z_sun a few clumps go through an additional high\ndensity (> 10^{10} cm^{-3}) fragmentation phase driven by dust-cooling, leading\nto low-mass fragments; (iii) The mass fraction in low-mass fragments is\ninitially very small, but at Z ~ 10^{-5}Z_sun it becomes dominant and continues\nto grow as Z is increased; (iv) as a result of the two fragmentation modes, a\nbimodal mass distribution emerges in 0.01 < Z/Z_sun < 0.1. (v) For > 0.1Z_sun,\nthe two peaks merge into a singly-peaked mass function which might be regarded\nas the precursor of the ordinary Salpeter-like IMF.",

We demonstrate that depending on the distance of this region\nfrom the star and the magnetic field strength, the frequency of the field line\nresonance can range from several Hz (weaker field, farther from star), to\napproximately kHz frequencies (stronger field, ~ 2-10 stellar radii from the\nstar).

It seems that either the choice of vector along which one projects\nthe spin of the first particle influences at superluminal speed the state of\nthe second particle, or naive realism holds true i.e., the projections of the\nspin of any EPR particle along all the vectors are determined before any\nmeasurement occurs). Naive realism is negated by Bell's theory that originated\nand is still most often presented as related to non-locality, a relation whose\nnecessity has recently been proven to be false. I advocate here that the\nsolution of the apparent paradox lies in the fact that the spin of the second\nparticle is determined along any vector, but not along all vectors. Such an\nany-all distinction was already present in quantum mechanics, for instance in\nthe fact that the spin can be measured along any vector but not at once along\nall vectors, as a result of the Uncertainty Principle. The time symmetry of the\nany-all distinction defended here is in fact reminiscent of (and I claim, due\nto) the time symmetry of the Uncertainty Principle described by Einstein,\nTolman, and Podolsky in 1931, in a paper entitled ``Knowledge of Past and\nFuture in Quantum Mechanics\" that is enough to negate naive realism and to hint\nat the any-all distinction. A simple classical model is next built, which\ncaptures aspects of the any-all distinction: the goal is of course not to have\na classical exact model, but to provide a caricature that might help some\npeople.",

The time and the length scales of the\ninstability are significantly longer and larger than the estimated formation\ntime and the observed mean separation of the GMCs, respectively. This paper\nexamines whether a replacement of the driving agent from the external to the\nself gravity might remove these obstacles by activating the gravitational\ninstability in the Galactic ISM disk. The self gravity can suppress the\nconvective motions, and a cooperative action of the Jeans and the Parker\ninstabilities can remove all the obstacles confronting the classical version of\nthe Parker instability. The mass and mean separation of the structures\nresulting from the odd-parity undular mode solution are shown to agree better\nwith the HI superclouds than with the GMCs.

    "summary": "In order to simplify and optimize the operation of our home made torque\nmagnetometer we created a new software system. The architecture is based on\nparallel, independently running instrument handlers communicating with a main\ncontrol program. All programs are designed as command driven state machines\nwhich greatly simplifies their maintenance and expansion. Moreover, as the main\nprogram may receive commands not only from the user interface, but also from\nother parallel running programs, an easy way of automation is achieved. A\nprogram working through a text file containing a sequence of commands and\nsending them to the main program suffices to automatically have the system\nconduct a complex set of measurements. In this paper we describe the system's\narchitecture and its implementation in LabVIEW.",

The spin-pulse profile shows a prominent (with a duty cycle of 14%) and\nbroad (with a FWHM of ~ 51 s) peak and a secondary peak which becomes more\nevident above 20 keV. The pulsed fraction increases with energy from ~ 45% at\n5--40 keV to ~ 80% at 40--80 keV. The morphology of the pulse profile also\nchanges as a function of energy, consistent with variations in the spectral\ncomponents that are visible in the pulse phase resolved spectra.

If the\nphonons are treated as classical variables, there is a critical value of the\nspin-phonon coupling above which a static distortion occurs. This is a good\napproximation if the zero point energy is small compared to the energy gain due\nto the distortion, which is true for large exchange interactions compared to\nthe phonons energy ($J\\gg\\hbar\\omega$). In the opposite limit, one can\nintegrate out the phonon degrees of freedom and get an effective spin\nhamiltonian. Using exact diagonalizations to include the quantum nature of both\nspins and phonons, we obtain the spectrum in the whole range of parameters and\nexplicit the crossover between the classical and quantum regimes. We then\nestablish quantitatively the limits of validity of two widely used approaches\n(one in the quantum and one in the classical limits) and show that they are\nquite poor for small magnetic clusters.

Although a vast number of\nmodels have been developed in order to extract biological knowledge from\ncomplex systems composed of basic elements as proteins, genes and chemical\ncompounds, a need remains for improving our understanding of dynamical features\nof the systems (i.e., temporal-dependence).\n  In this article, we analyze the gene expression dynamics (i.e., how the genes\nexpression fluctuates in time) by using a new constructive approach. This\napproach is based on only two fundamental ingredients: symmetry and the Markov\nproperty of dynamics. First, by using experimental data of human and yeast gene\nexpression time series, we found a symmetry in short-time transition\nprobability from time $t$ to time $t+1$. We call it self-similarity symmetry\n(i.e., surprisingly, the gene expression short-time fluctuations contain a\nrepeating pattern of smaller and smaller parts that are like the whole, but\ndifferent in size). Secondly, the Markov property of dynamics reflects that the\nshort-time fluctuation governs the full-time behaviour of the system. Here, we\nsucceed in reconstructing naturally the global behavior of the observed\ndistribution of gene expression (i.e., scaling-law) and the local behaviour of\nthe power-law tail of this distribution, by using only these two ingredients:\nsymmetry and the Markov property of dynamics.

    "summary": "Recent OGLE (Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment) and GLITP\n(Gravitational Lens International Time Project) monitoring data for QSO\n2237+0305 (Huchra et al.) have been analyzed through a newly optimized N-body\nmicrolensing analysis method, the Local HAE Caustic Modeling (LOHCAM). This\nmethod simultaneously solves for the size of the source and N-body HAE (High\nAmplification Events) caustic shapes in the source plane and determines those\nsizes only as a function of the projected transverse velocity of the source. By\napplying this method to the light curves of the A & C lensed components in the\nEinstein Cross, these data are accurately reconstructed for the first time.\n  From these modeling studies, we report several interesting results: the\nminimum number of microlenses required for possible caustic models, the\npossible evidence of an accretion disk with a central hole at the heart of the\nquasar, the size of the UV-continuum source, the masses of the microlenses\nbeing directly responsible for the observed HAEs, the estimated mass range of a\nsuper massive black hole (SMBH) in QSO 2237+0305 and finally some clues for the\ndirection of the source motion in the sky.",

    "summary": "Recently it has been proposed to construct quantum error-correcting codes\nthat embed a finite-dimensional Hilbert space in the infinite-dimensional\nHilbert space of a system described by continuous quantum variables [D.\nGottesman et al., Phys. Rev. A 64, 012310 (2001)]. The main difficulty of this\ncontinuous variable encoding relies on the physical generation of the quantum\ncodewords. We show that ponderomotive interaction suffices to this end. As a\nmatter of fact, this kind of interaction between a system and a meter causes a\nfrequency change on the meter proportional to the position quadrature of the\nsystem. Then, a phase measurement of the meter leaves the system in an\neigenstate of the stabilizer generators, provided that system and meter's\ninitial states are suitably prepared. Here we show how to implement this\ninteraction using trapped ions, and how the encoding can be performed on their\nmotional degrees of freedom. The robustness of the codewords with respect to\nthe various experimental imperfections is then analyzed.",

Few and realistic assumptions are necessary on the\nquasar photometric variations (peak-to-peak amplitude and time-scale of the\nvariations) and on the accuracy of the individual photometric points. The\noutput of the simulations is the (statistical) relative error made on the time\ndelay measurement, as a function of 1- the object visibility over the year, 2-\nthe temporal sampling of the light curves and 3- the time delay. Also\ninvestigated is the effect of long term microlensing variations which must be\nbelow the 5 % level (either intrinsically or by subtraction) if the goal is to\nmeasure time delays with an accuracy of 1-2 %. However, while microlensing\nincreases the random error on the time delay, it does not significantly\nincrease the systematic error, which is always a factor 5 to 10 smaller than\nthe random error. Finally, it is shown that, when the time delay is comparable\nto the visibility window of the object, a logarithmic sampling can\nsignificantly improve the time delay determination.

This is a formidable task since the FX market\nis characterized by a web of fluctuating exchange rates, with subtle\ninter-dependencies which may change in time. In practice, traders talk of\nparticular currencies being 'in play' during a particular period of time -- yet\nthere is no established machinery for detecting such important information.\nHere we apply the construction of Minimum Spanning Trees (MSTs) to the FX\nmarket, and show that the MST can capture important features of the global FX\ndynamics. Moreover, we show that the MST can help identify momentarily dominant\nand dependent currencies.",

    "summary": "The measurement of the close-to-the-carrier noise of rf and microwave devices\nis a relevant issue in time and frequency metrology and in some fields of\nelectronics, physics and optics. While phase noise is the main concern,\namplitude noise is often of interest. The highest sensitivity is achieved with\nthe bridge (interferometric) method, which consists of the amplification and\nsynchronous detection of the noise sidebands after suppressing the carrier by\nvector subtraction of an equal signal. A substantial progress in understanding\nthe flicker noise mechanism of the interferometer results in new schemes that\nimprove by 20--30 dB the sensitivity at low Fourier frequencies.\n  The article provides the complete theory and detailed design criteria, and\nreports on the implementation of a prototype. In real-time measurements, a\nbackground noise of -175 -180 dBrad^2/Hz has been obtained at f=1 Hz off the\n100 MHz carrier. Exploiting correlation and averaging in similar conditions,\nthe sensitivity exceeds -185 dBrad^2/Hz at f=1 Hz. A residual noise of -203\ndBrad^2/Hz at f=250 Hz off the carrier has been obtained, while the ultimate\nnoise floor is still limited by the averaging capability of the correlator.\nThis is equivalent to a S/N ratio of 2E20 with a frequency spacing of 2.5E-6.\n  Applications include the measurement of the properties of materials and the\nobservation of weak flicker-type physical phenomena, out of reach for other\ninstruments. We measured the flicker noise of a by-step attenuator (-171\ndB[rad^2]/Hz at f=1 Hz) and of the ferrite noise of a reactive power divider\n(-173.7 dB[rad^2]/Hz at f=1 Hz) without need of correlation.",

Based on the properties of the Lie group of\nrotations of S^3 it is shown that the spectrum and its variance may be computed\nsolely from the matrix elements of the group-averaging operator, for each of\nthe manifolds S^3/I^*, S^3/O^* and S^3/T^*. Further, it is proved that the\nspectrum of the CMB may be calculated solely from the radial function, due to\nthe symmetry properties of the Lie-algebra, which is rigorously proven. It is\nshown, that if the topology of the universe is S^3/I^* the uncertainty on the\nestimates for the total energy density of the universe may be reduced by an\norder of magnitude.

We perform a numerical\nanalysis to solve both the radial and angular parts of the scalar field\nequation, and derive exact results for the radial wavefunction and angular\neigenvalues, respectively. We then determine the Hawking radiation energy\nemission rate, and find that, as the angular momentum increases, it is\nsuppressed in the low-energy regime but enhanced in the intermediate and\nhigh-energy regimes. Our results agree with previous analytical studies,\nderived in the low-angular momentum and low-energy approximation, and\ngeneralize them to include angular momentum and energy regimes that were until\nnow unexplored. We also investigate the energy amplification due to\nsuper-radiance and we find that, in the presence of extra dimensions, the\neffect is significantly enhanced.",

The potential destruction of Li7 is strongly constrained by\nobservations of Deuterium (D), He3 and Li6.

However, in these regions either the D\nabundance is unacceptably low or the ratio He3/D is unacceptably large. We\nconclude that late particle decay is unable to explain both the discrepancy of\nthe calculated Li7 abundance and the observed Li7 plateau.

We find that VSe in the\nchalcopyrite materials is amphoteric having two \"negative-U\" like transitions,\ni.e. a double-donor transition e(2+/0) close to the valence band and a\ndouble-acceptor transition e(0/2-) closer to the conduction band. We introduce\na classification scheme that distinguishes two types of defects (e.g., donors):\ntype-alpha, which have a defect-localized-state (DLS) in the gap, and\ntype-beta, which have a resonant DLS within the host bands (e.g., conduction\nband). In the latter case, the introduced carriers (e.g., electrons) relax to\nthe band edge where they can occupy a perturbed-host-state (PHS). Type alpha is\nnon-conducting, whereas type beta is conducting. We identify the neutral anion\nvacancy as type-alpha and the doubly positively charged vacancy as type-beta.\nWe suggest that illumination changes the charge state of the anion vacancy and\nleads to a crossover between alpha- and beta-type behavior, resulting in\nmetastability and PPC. In CuInSe2, the metastable behavior of VSe is carried\nover to the (VSe-VCu) complex, which we identify as the physical origin of PPC\nobserved experimentally.

In situations where the gravitational wave\nbackground is described by an `almost' Friedmann-Lema{\\^i}tre-Robertson-Walker\n(FLRW) cosmology we find that the magnitude of the original magnetic field is\namplified by an amount proportional to the magnitude of the gravitational wave\ninduced shear anisotropy and the square of the field's initial co-moving scale.\nWe apply this mechanism to the case where the seed field and gravitational wave\nbackground are produced during inflation and find that the magnitude of the\ngravitational boost depends significantly on the manner in which the estimate\nof the shear anisotropy at the end of inflation is calculated. Assuming a seed\nfield of $10^{-34}$ $\\rm{G}$ spanning a comoving scale of about $10 \\rm{kpc}$\ntoday, the shear anisotropy at the end of inflation must be at least as large\nas $10^{-40}$ in order to obtain a generated magnetic field of the same order\nof magnitude as the original seed.

We use VLA radio observations, as well\nas HST imaging and polarimetry data, to examine the jet's broad-band spectrum\nand inquire as to the nature of particle acceleration in the jet. As shown in\nprevious papers, a simple continuous injection model for synchrotron-emitting\nknots, in which both the filling factor, $f_{acc}$, of regions within which\nparticles are accelerated and the energy spectrum of the injected particles are\nconstant, cannot account for the X-ray flux or spectrum. Instead, we propose\nthat $f_{acc}$ is a function of position and energy and find that in the inner\njet, $f_{acc} \\propto E_\\gamma^{-0.4 \\pm 0.2} \\propto E_e^{-0.2 \\pm 0.1}$, and\nin knots A and B, $f_{acc} \\propto E_\\gamma^{-0.7 \\pm 0.2} \\propto E_e^{-0.35\n\\pm 0.1}$, where $E_\\gamma$ is the emitted photon energy and and $E_e$ is the\nemitting electron energy. In this model, the index $p$ of the injected electron\nenergy spectrum ($n(E_{e}) \\propto E_{e}^{-p}$) is $p=2.2$ at all locations in\nthe jet, as predicted by models of cosmic ray acceleration by ultrarelativistic\nshocks. There is a strong correlation between the peaks of X-ray emission and\nminima of optical percentage polarization, i.e., regions where the jet magnetic\nfield is not ordered. We suggest that the X-ray peaks coincide with shock waves\nwhich accelerate the X-ray emitting electrons and cause changes in the\ndirection of the magnetic field; the polarization is thus small because of beam\naveraging.",

    "summary": "The designation of the customary restricted three-body disturbing potential\n$\\Phi$ as the perturbation Hamiltonian is believed to be the cause of Neptune\nring arcs' radial offset between theories and observations. To identify the\nappropriate perturbation Hamiltonian, the energy integral in the fixed frame of\na restricted three-body system, consisting of the central, primary, and test\nbodies, is reconsidered. It is shown that the perturbation energy includes the\ndisturbing potential $\\Phi$ and the potential arising from the angular momentum\nterms of the test body. Both potentials happen to be singular as the test body\ngoes to infinity contradicting to the perturbation nature. These two potentials\ncan be combined to an energy relevant disturbing potential $\\Phi^{*}=\\beta\\Phi$\nwhich is regular at infinity because of the cancellation of the singularities.\nFor circular orbits of the primary, the energy equation is conservative, and\n$\\Phi^{*}$ is identified as the perturbation Hamiltonian. Applying this result\nto evaluate the backgrund effect of Triton to the arc-Galatea system of\nNeptune, it is shown that there is a small difference\n$\\Delta\\Phi=(\\Phi^{*}-\\Phi)$ which amounts to an outward radial offset of the\ncorotation location of Galatea by 0.3 Km. The mismatch between the pattern\nspeed of Galatea's corotation potential and the mean motion velocity of the\narcs could be resolved by considering the finite mass of Fraternite. However,\nby using $\\Phi^{*}$, Galatea's eccentricity could be reassessed in terms of the\nmass of Fraternite.",

Spatially resolved STIS spectra constrain the neutral-gas column\ndensity to be LogN(HI)=20.5 in both Aand B. UVES spectra (spectral resolution\nFWHM=9.8 km/s) show, in contrast, significant line-of-sight differences in the\ncolumn densities of MnII and FeII; these are not due to observational\nsystematics. We find that [Mn/H]=-1.44 and [Fe/H]=-1.52 in damped Lya system A,\nwhile [Mn/H]=-0.98 and [Fe/H]>-1.32, and possibly as high as [Fe/H] approx. -1\nin damped Lya system B. A careful assessment of possible systematic errors\nleads us to conclude that these transverse differences are significant at a 5\nsigma level or greater. Although nucleosynthesis effects may also be at play,\nwe favor differential dust-depletion as the main mechanism producing the\nobserved abundance gradient. The transverse separation is 5 kpc at the redshift\nof the absorber, which is also likely to be the lensing galaxy. The derived\nabundances therefore probe two opposite sides of a single galaxy hosting both\ndamped Lya systems. This is the first time firm abundance constraints have been\nobtained for a single damped system probed by two lines-of-sight.

This is particularly appropriate when the\ndisk is optically thick to its own IR radiation, as in the central regions of\nULIRGs. Because the disk radiates at its Eddington limit, the Schmidt-law for\nstar formation changes in the optically-thick limit, with the star formation\nrate per unit area scaling as Sigma_g/kappa, where Sigma_g is the gas surface\ndensity and kappa is the mean opacity.

We compare our predictions with\nobservations and find good agreement. We extend our model from many-hundred\nparsec scales to sub-parsec scales and address the problem of fueling AGN. We\nassume that angular momentum transport proceeds via global torques rather than\na local viscosity. We account for the radial depletion of gas due to star\nformation and find a strong bifurcation between two classes of disk models: (1)\nsolutions with a starburst on large scales that consumes all of the gas with\nlittle fueling of a central AGN and (2) models with an outer large-scale\nstarburst accompanied by a more compact starburst on 1-10 pc scales and a\nbright central AGN. The luminosity of the latter models is in many cases\ndominated by the AGN. We show that the vertical thickness of the starburst disk\non pc scales can approach h ~ r, perhaps accounting for the nuclear obscuration\nin some Type 2 AGN.

Key ingredients in our proof are the identification of\nsymmetries enjoyed by the extremal functions correrresponding to the best\nconstant in half-space, as well as a fine analysis of the asymptotic behaviour\nof appropriate minimizing sequences. The result holds true also in dimension 3\nbut the more involved proof will be dealt with in a forthcoming paper [17].",

Our estimate of $R_0$ is 1.83 (SD 0.06) for Congo (1995)\nand 1.34 (SD 0.03) for Uganda (2000). We model the course of the outbreaks via\nan SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed) epidemic model that includes a\nsmooth transition in the transmission rate after control interventions are put\nin place. We perform an uncertainty analysis of the basic reproductive number\n$R_0$ to quantify its sensitivity to other disease-related parameters. We also\nanalyze the sensitivity of the final epidemic size to the time interventions\nbegin and provide a distribution for the final epidemic size. The control\nmeasures implemented during these two outbreaks (including education and\ncontact tracing followed by quarantine) reduce the final epidemic size by a\nfactor of 2 relative the final size with a two-week delay in their\nimplementation.",

    "summary": "This paper presents a unique approach to connecting requirements engineering\n(RE) activities into a process framework that can be employed to obtain quality\nrequirements with reduced expenditures of effort and cost. We propose a\ntwo-phase model that is novel in that it introduces the concept of verification\nand validation (V&V) early in the requirements life cycle. In the first phase,\nwe perform V&V immediately following the elicitation of requirements for each\nindividually distinct system function. Because the first phase focuses on\ncapturing smaller sets of related requirements iteratively, each corresponding\nV&V activity is better focused for detecting and correcting errors in each\nrequirement set. In the second phase, a complementary verification activity is\ninitiated; the corresponding focus is on the quality of linkages between\nrequirements sets rather than on the requirements within the sets.\nConsequently, this approach reduces the effort in verification and enhances the\nfocus on the verification task. Our approach, unlike other models, has a\nminimal time delay between the elicitation of requirements and the execution of\nthe V&V activities. Because of this short time gap, the stakeholders have a\nclearer recollection of the requirements, their context and rationale; this\nenhances the stakeholder feedback. Furthermore, our model includes activities\nthat closely align with the effective RE processes employed in the software\nindustry. Thus, our approach facilitates a better understanding of the flow of\nrequirements, and provides guidance for the implementation of the RE process.",

XA is the counterpart\nof the near-infrared source IRS 7, whereas XB has no K-band counterpart above\n19.4 mag. This indicates that XB is younger than typical Class I protostars,\nprobably a Class 0 protostar or in an intermediate phase between Class 0 and\nClass I. The X-ray luminosity of XB varied between 29<log LX <31.2 ergs s-1 on\ntimescales of 3-30 months. XB also showed a monotonic increase in X-ray\nbrightness by a factor of two in 30 ksec during an XMM-Newton observation. The\nXMM-Newton spectra indicate emission from a hot plasma with kT ~3-4 keV and\nalso show fluorescent emission from cold iron. Though the X-ray spectrum from\nXB is similar to flare spectra from Class I protostars in luminosity and\ntemperature, the light curve does not resemble the lightcurves of magnetically\ngenerated X-ray flares because the variability timescale of XB is too long and\nbecause variations in X-ray count rate were not accompanied by variations in\nspectral hardness. The short-term variation of XB may be caused by the partial\nblocking of the X-ray plasma, while the month-long flux enhancement may be\ndriven by mass accretion.",

    "summary": "Ever since Karl Schwarzschild's 1916 discovery of the spacetime geometry\ndescribing the interior of a particular idealized general relativistic star --\na static spherically symmetric blob of fluid with position-independent density\n-- the general relativity community has continued to devote considerable time\nand energy to understanding the general-relativistic static perfect fluid\nsphere. Over the last 90 years a tangle of specific perfect fluid spheres has\nbeen discovered, with most of these specific examples seemingly independent\nfrom each other. To bring some order to this collection, in this article we\ndevelop several new transformation theorems that map perfect fluid spheres into\nperfect fluid spheres. These transformation theorems sometimes lead to\nunexpected connections between previously known perfect fluid spheres,\nsometimes lead to new previously unknown perfect fluid spheres, and in general\ncan be used to develop a systematic way of classifying the set of all perfect\nfluid spheres.",

In addition, using\nsub-arcsecond radio image of the Mouse, we identify modulations in the\nbrightness distribution of the Mouse that may be associated with the unshocked\npulsar wind behind the pulsar.

The leading twist is determined\nwith remarkably good accuracy and is compared with the predictions obtained\nusing various polarized parton distribution sets available in the literature.\nThe contribution of higher twists to the g1 moments is found to be\nsignificantly larger than in the case of the unpolarized structure function F2.",

The preparation\nof the chromium condensate requires novel cooling strategies that are adapted\nto its special electronic and magnetic properties. The final step to reach\nquantum degeneracy is forced evaporative cooling of 52Cr atoms within a crossed\noptical dipole trap. At a critical temperature of T~700nK, we observe\nBose-Einstein condensation by the appearance of a two-component velocity\ndistribution.

We observe critical behavior of the condensate\nfraction as a function of temperature and more than 50,000 condensed 52Cr\natoms.",

A robust test of the standard model vs.\nnew physics is its prediction of equal direct CP violation in $B_s \\to K^-\n\\pi^+$ decay. CPT invariance requires the observed CP violation to arise from\nthe interference between the dominant penguin amplitude and another amplitude\nwith a different weak phase and a different strong phase. The penguin\ncontribution to $B_d \\to K^+ \\pi^-$ is known to be reduced by a CKM factor in\n$B_s \\to K^- \\pi^+$. Thus the two branching ratios are very different and a\ndifferent CP violation is expected. But in the standard model a miracle occurs\nand the interfering tree diagram is enhanced by the same CKM factor that\nreduces the penguin to give the predicted equality. This miracle is not\nexpected in new physics; thus a search for and measurement of the predicted CP\nviolation in $B_s \\to K^- \\pi^+$ decay is a sensitive test for a new physics\ncontribution. A detailed analysis shows this prediction to be robust and\ninsensitive to symmetry breaking effects and possible additional contributions.",

First, we extract the CMB component\nfrom simulated Planck data (in small patches of the sky) using the maximum\nentropy method (MEM), Wiener filter (WF) and a method based on the subtraction\nof foreground templates plus a linear combination of frequency channels (LCFC).\nWe then apply a wavelet-based method to study the Gaussianity of the recovered\nCMB and compare it with the same analysis for the input map. When the original\nCMB map is Gaussian (and assuming that point sources have been removed), we\nfind that none of the methods introduce non-Gaussianity (NG) in the CMB\nreconstruction. On the contrary, if the input CMB map is non-Gaussian, all the\nstudied methods produce a reconstructed CMB with lower detections of NG than\nthe original map. This effect is mainly due to the presence of instrumental\nnoise. In this case, MEM tends to produce slightly higher non-Gaussian\ndetections in the reconstructed map than WF whereas the detections are lower\nfor the LCFC. We have also studied the effect of point sources in the MEM\nreconstruction. If no attempt to remove point sources is performed, they\nclearly contaminate the CMB reconstruction, introducing spurious NG. When the\nbrightest point sources are removed from the data using the Mexican Hat\nWavelet, the Gaussian character of the CMB is preserved. However, when\nanalysing larger regions of the sky, the variance of our estimators will be\nappreciably reduced and, in this case, we expect the point source residuals to\nintroduce spurious NG in the CMB. Thus, a careful subtraction (or masking) of\npoint source emission is crucial when studying the Gaussianity of the CMB.",

In this paper, we\npropose a simple model for studying bottleneck effects of lane-changing traffic\nand aggregate traffic dynamics of a roadway with lane-changing areas. Based on\nthe observation that, when changing its lane, a vehicle affects traffic on both\nits current and target lanes, we propose to capture such lateral interactions\nby introducing a new lane-changing intensity variable. With a modified\nfundamental diagram, we are able to study the impacts of lane-changing traffic\non overall traffic flow. In addition, the corresponding traffic dynamics can be\ndescribed with a simple kinematic wave model. For a location-dependent\nlane-changing intensity variable, we discuss kinematic wave solutions of the\nRiemann problem of the new model and introduce a supply-demand method for its\nnumerical solutions. With both theoretical and empirical analysis, we\ndemonstrate that lane-changes could have significant bottleneck effects on\noverall traffic flow. In the future, we will be interested in studying\nlane-changing intensities for different road geometries, locations,\non-ramp/off-ramp flows, as well as traffic conditions.

The first three are very close, possibly detached, early-type binaries and\nall three require further investigation. Particularly interesting is V395 And\nwhose spectral type is as early as B7/8 for a 0.685 day orbit binary. KS Peg\nand IW Per are single-line binaries, with the former probably hosting a very\nlow mass star. We have detected a low-mass secondary in an important\nsemi-detached system FO Vir at q=0.125+/-0.005. The contact binary FP Boo is\nalso a very small mass-ratio system, q=0.106+/-0.005. The other contact\nbinaries in this group are V592 Per, TU UMi and the well known SW Lac. V592 Per\nand TU UMi have bright tertiary companions; for these binaries, and for V395\nAnd, we used a novel technique of the broadening functions arranged into a\n2-dimensional image in phase. The case of TU UMi turned out intractable even\nusing this approach and we have not been able to derive a firm radial velocity\norbit for this binary. Three systems of this group were observed\nspectroscopically before: HS Aqr, SW Lac, KS Peg.",

The original scheme has its weakness in letting quantifiably more\ninformation gain to an eavesdropper during public announcement of unencrypted\nbases lists. The security of the secret key comes at the expense of the final\nkey length. We aim at exploiting the randomness of preparation (measurement)\nbasis and the bit values encoded (observed), so as to randomize the bases lists\nbefore they are communicated over the public channel. A proof of security is\ngiven for our scheme and proven that our protocol results in lesser information\ngain by Eve in comparison with BB84 and its other extensions. Moreover, an\nanalysis is made on the feasibility of our proposal as such and to support\nentanglement based QKD. The performance of our protocol is compared in terms of\nthe upper and lower bounds on the tolerable bit error rate. We also quantify\nthe information gain (by Eve) mathematically using the familiar approach of the\nconcept of Shannon entropy. The paper models the attack by Eve in terms of\ninterference in a multi-access quantum channel. Besides, this paper also hints\nat the invalidation of a separate privacy amplification step in the\n\"prepare-and-measure\" protocols in general.",

Hence existing\nresults fail in the more general case when the subsystems are uniformly\nsemiglobally practically asymptotically stable (USPAS). This situation is often\nencountered in control practice, e.g., in control of physical systems with\nexternal perturbations, measurement noise, unmodelled dynamics, etc. This paper\ngeneralizes previous results for cascades by establishing that, under a uniform\nboundedness condition, the cascade of two USPAS systems remains USPAS. An\nanalogous result can be derived for USAS systems in cascade.

This is in\ncontrast to the standard stability analysis in which small scale perturbations\nare stabilized by pressure. In the limit of small scales the dispersion\nrelation for the growth rate reduces to that of thermal instabilities in a\nfluid without gravity. If instabilities lead to star formation, then our\nresults imply a secondary mode of star formation which operates on small scales\nand feeds on the existence of a primary mode on intermediate scales. This may\nbe interpreted as a positive feedback. Further, the standard stability\ncriterion on intermediate scales is significantly modified.",

The 2\\degr X 2\\degr field, centred in\n(\\alpha=5^h,\\delta=-49\\degr), is located in the region observed by the\nBOOMERanG experiment. Our observations has been carried out with the Parkes\nRadio telescope and represent the highest frequency detection done to date in\nlow emission areas. Because of a weaker Faraday rotation action, the high\nfrequency allows an estimate of the Galactic synchrotron contamination of the\nCosmic Microwave Background Polarization (CMBP) that is more reliable than that\ndone at 1.4 GHz. We find that the angular power spectra of the E- and B-modes\nhave slopes of \\beta_E = -1.46 +/- 0.14 and \\beta_B = -1.87 +/- 0.22,\nindicating a flattening with respect to 1.4 GHz. Extrapolated up to 32 GHz, the\nE-mode spectrum is about 3 orders of magnitude lower than that of the CMBP,\nallowing a clean detection even at this frequency. The best improvement\nconcerns the B-mode, for which our single-dish observations provide the first\nestimate of the contamination on angular scales close to the CMBP peak (about 2\ndegrees). We find that the CMBP B-mode should be stronger than synchrotron\ncontamination at 90 GHz for models with T/S > 0.01.

It follows from our analysis that throughout most of the phase\ndiagram the spectrum consists of degenerate quartets of kinks and anti-kinks\nand a multiplet of vector particles split according to the symmetry of the\nproblem as 3 + 2 +1. This basic picture experiences corrections when one moves\nthrough the phase diagram. In some regions the splitting may become very small\nand in others it is so large that some multiplets are pushed in the continuum\nand become unstable. At second order transition lines masses of certain\nparticles vanish. Very close to the first order transition line additional\ngenerations of particles emerge. Strong interactions in some sectors may\ngenerate additional bound states (like breathers) in the asymmetric charge\nsector. We briefly describe the properties of various correlation functions in\ndifferent phases.",

    "summary": "The build up of the stress whose relaxation is presumed to account for pulsar\nfrequency glitches can be attributed to various mechanisms, of which the most\nefficient involve differential rotation of the neutron superfluid in the inner\nlayers of the (magnetically braked) solid crust of a rotating neutron star. In\nsuch a case it is usually supposed that the stress is attributable to pinning\nof superfluid vortices to crust nuclei, but it has been suggested that, even if\nthe pinning effect is too weak, a comparably large stress might still arise\njust from the deficit of centrifugal buoyancy in the slowed down crust. The\npresent work is a re-examination that investigates the way such processes may\nbe affected by considerations that were overlooked in the previous work --\nnotably uncertainties about the ``effective'' masses that have to be attributed\nto the ``free'' superfluid neutrons to allow for their entrainment by the ionic\ncrust material. Though restricted to a Newtonian formulation, this analysis\ndistinguishes more carefully than has been usual between true velocities, which\nare contravariantly vectorial, and so called ``superfluid velocities'' that are\nproportional to momenta, which are essentially covectorial, a technicality that\nis important when more than one independent current is involved. The results\ninclude a Proudman type theorem to the effect that the superfluid angular\nvelocity must be constant on slightly deformed Taylor cylinders in the force\nfree case, and it is shown how to construct a pair of integral constants of the\nmotion that determine the solution for the pinned case assuming beta\nequilibrium.",

Direct\nmeasurements of sigma_* at high redshift are difficult, and the width of the\nnarrow emission lines of AGN has been proposed as a surrogate. We investigate\nthe utility of using sigma_[OIII] for sigma_* by examining host galaxy\nmagnitudes and [OIII] line widths for low redshift QSOs. For radio-quiet QSOs,\nsigma_[OIII] is consistent in the mean with the value of sigma_* predicted by\nthe Faber-Jackson relation. For our limited range of host luminosity, scatter\nobscures the expected increase of sigma_[OIII] with host luminosity.

Radio-loud QSOs on\naverage have sigma_* smaller by ~0.1 dex than radio-quiet QSOs of similar host\nluminsotiy, at least for luminosities typical of PG QSOs.

This metric is obtained by\nasymptotically matching a post-Newtonian metric for a binary system to a\nperturbed Schwarzschild metric for each hole. In the inner zone near each hole,\nthe metric is given by the Schwarzschild solution plus a quadrupolar\nperturbation corresponding to an external tidal gravitational field. In the\nnear zone, well outside each black hole but less than a reduced wavelength from\nthe center of mass of the binary, the metric is given by a post-Newtonian\nexpansion including the lowest-order deviations from flat spacetime. When the\nnear zone overlaps each inner zone in a buffer zone, the post-Newtonian and\nperturbed Schwarzschild metrics can be asymptotically matched to each other. By\ndemanding matching (over a 4-volume in the buffer zone) rather than patching\n(choosing a particular 2-surface in the buffer zone), we guarantee that the\nerrors are small in all zones. The resulting piecewise metric is made formally\n$C^\\infty$ with smooth transition functions so as to obtain the finite\nextrinsic curvature of a 3-slice. In addition to the metric and extrinsic\ncurvature, we present explicit results for the lapse and the shift, which can\nbe used as initial data for numerical simulations. This initial data is not\naccurate all the way to the asymptotically flat ends inside each hole, and\ntherefore must be used with evolution codes which employ black hole excision\nrather than puncture methods.

Moreover, the ratio between the moduli is found to be\nlarger than the prediction of the elastic theory by a constant value. The\nunderstanding of these discrepancies has been a longstanding question in the\nfield of granular matter. Here we perform a test of the applicability of\nelasticity theory to granular materials. We perform sound propagation\nexperiments, numerical simulations and theoretical studies to understand the\nelastic response of a deforming granular assembly of soft spheres under\nisotropic loading. Our results for the behavior of the elastic moduli of the\nsystem agree very well with experiments. We show that the elasticity partially\ndescribes the experimental and numerical results for a system under\ncompressional loads. However, it drastically fails for systems under shear\nperturbations, particularly for packings without tangential forces and\nfriction. Our work indicates that a correct treatment should include not only\nthe purely elastic response but also collective relaxation mechanisms related\nto structural disorder and nonaffine motion of grains.",

In this\nsecond paper, we present a deeper analysis of the morphological properties of\nthese systems, including both the host galaxies and their surrounding aligned\nemission. The host galaxies of our 6C subsample are well described as de\nVaucouleurs ellipticals, with typical scale sizes of ~10kpc. This is comparable\nto the host galaxies of low-z radio sources of similar powers, and also the\nmore powerful 3CR sources at the same redshift. The contribution of nuclear\npoint source emission is also comparable, regardless of radio power. The 6C\nalignment effect is remarkably similar to that seen around more powerful 3CR\nsources at the same redshift in terms of extent and degree of alignment with\nthe radio source axis, although it is generally less luminous. The bright,\nknotty features observed in the case of the z~1 3CR sources are far less\nfrequent in our 6C subsample; neither do we observe such strong evidence for\nevolution in the strength of the alignment effect with radio source size/age.\nHowever, we do find a very strong link between the most extreme alignment\neffects and emission line region properties indicative of shocks, regardless of\nsource size/age or power. In general, the 6C alignment effect is still\nconsiderably stronger than that seen around lower redshift galaxies of similar\nradio powers. (abridged)",

Studies are carried out for several\ncombinations of the ordering of the Curie temperatures of the austenite and\nmartensite phases and, the martensite transformation temperature. We find that\nthe orientation of the magnetic order which generally points along the short\naxis of the rectangular variant, changes as one crosses the twin or the\nmartensite-austenite interface. The model shows the possibility of a subtle\ninterplay between the growth of strain and magnetic order parameters as the\ntemperature is decreased. In some cases, this leads to qualitatively different\nmagnetization curves from those predicted by earlier mean field models.\nFurther, we find that strain morphology can be substantially altered by the\nmagnetic order. We have also studied the dynamic hysteresis behavior.\n  The corresponding dissipation during the forward and reverse cycles has\nfeatures similar to the Barkhausen's noise.",

With quantum mechanical and classical simulations and theory we\npresent a scheme using a dipole force barrier to select the coldest atoms from\na magnetically trapped atom cloud. The dipole and magnetic potentials create a\nlocal minimum which traps the coldest atoms. A unique advantage of this\ntechnique is the sharp cut-off in the velocity distribution of the sample of\nselected atoms. Such a non-thermal distribution should prove useful for a\nvariety of experiments, including proposed studies of atomic tunneling and\nscattering from quantum potentials. We show that when the rms size of the atom\ncloud is smaller than the local minimum in which the selected atoms are\ntrapped, the velocity selection technique can be more efficient in 1-D than\nsome common techniques such as evaporative cooling. For example, one simulation\nshows nearly 6% of the atoms retained at a temperature 100 times lower than the\nstarting condition.",

There\nare, however, anomalous natural and artificial systems that violate the basic\nrequirements for its applicability. Different physical entropies, other than\nthe standard one, appear to be necessary in order to satisfactorily deal with\nsuch anomalies. One of such entropies is $S_q \\equiv k (1-\\int dx\n[f(x)]^q)/(1-q)$ (with $S_1=S_{BG}$), where the entropic index $q$ is a real\nparameter. It has been proposed as the basis for a generalization, referred to\nas {\\it nonextensive statistical mechanics}, of the $BG$ theory. $S_q$ shares\nwith $S_{BG}$ four remarkable properties, namely {\\it concavity} ($\\forall\nq>0$), {\\it Lesche-stability} ($\\forall q>0$), {\\it finiteness of the entropy\nproduction per unit time} ($q \\in \\Re$), and {\\it additivity} (for at least a\ncompact support of $q$ including $q=1$).

Consequently, the dynamic radio sky\nis poorly sampled, in contrast to the situation in the X- and gamma-ray bands\nin which wide-field instruments routinely detect transient sources. Here we\nreport a new transient source, GCRT J1745-3009, detected in 2002 during a\nmoderately wide-field radio transient monitoring program of the Galactic center\n(GC) region at 0.33 GHz. The characteristics of its bursts are unlike those\nknown for any other class of radio transient. If located in or near the GC, its\nbrightness temperature (~10^16 K) and the implied energy density within GCRT\nJ1745-3009 vastly exceeds that observed in most other classes of radio\nastronomical sources, and is consistent with coherent emission processes rarely\nobserved. We conclude that GCRT J1745-3009 is the first member of a new class\nof radio transient sources, the first of possibly many new classes to be\nidentified through current and upcoming radio surveys.",

In the limit of weak anisotropy, that is, weak large-scale\nmagnetic field, our model reproduces the Goldreich-Sridhar spectrum, while the\nlimit of strong anisotropy, that is, strong large-scale magnetic field,\ncorresponds to the Iroshnikov-Kraichnan scaling of the spectrum.

Five sources in the redshift range z~1-3.5 were\ndetected, nearly doubling the number of SMGs detected in CO. We summarise the\nproperties of all 12 CO-detected SMGs, as well as 6 sources not detected in CO\nby our survey, and use this sample to explore the bulk physical properties of\nthe SMG population as a whole. The median CO line luminosity of the SMGs is\n<L_CO> = (3.8 +- 2.0) x 10^10 K km/s pc^2. Using a CO-to-H_2 conversion factor\nappropriate for starburst galaxies, this corresponds to a molecular gas mass\n<M(H_2)> = (3.0 +- 1.6) x 10^10 Msun within a ~2kpc radius, about four times\ngreater than the most luminous local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs)\nbut comparable to that of the most extreme high-redshift radio galaxies and\nQSOs. The median CO fwhm linewidth is broad, <fwhm> = 780 +- 320 km/s, and the\nSMGs often have double peaked line profiles, indicative of either a merger or a\ndisk. From their median gas reservoirs (~3 x 10^10 Msun) and star-formation\nrates (>700 Msun/yr) we estimate a lower limit on the typical gas-depletion\ntime scale of >40Myr in SMGs. This is marginally below the typical age expected\nfor the starbursts in SMGs, and suggests that negative feedback processes may\nplay an important role in prolonging the gas consumption time scale. We find a\nstatistically-significant correlation between the far-infrared and CO\nluminosities of the SMGs which extends the observed correlation for local\nULIRGs to higher luminosities and higher redshifts.

The goal of this article is to broaden the foundations of\ncombinatorial rigidity theory by replacing G with an arbitrary representable\nmatroid M. The ideas of rigidity independence and parallel independence, as\nwell as Laman's and Recski's combinatorial characterizations of 2-dimensional\nrigidity for graphs, can naturally be extended to this winder setting. As we\nexplain, many of these fundamental concepts really depend only on the matroid\nassociated with G (or its Tutte polynomial) and have little to do with the\nspecial nature of graphic matroids or the field R.\n  Our main result is a \"nesting theorem\" relating the various kinds of\nindependence. Immediate corollaries include generalizations of Laman's Theorem,\nas well as the equality of 2-rigidity and 2-parallel independence. A key tool\nin our study is the space of photos of M, a natural algebraic variety whose\nirreducibility is closely related to the notions of rigidity independence and\nparallel independence.\n  The number of points on this variety, when working over a finite field, turns\nout to be an interesting Tutte polynomial evaluation.",

This remnant has been known for some time to exhibit a turnover in\nits integrated radio continuum spectrum at frequencies < 100 MHz, indicative of\nfree-free absorption from thermal ionized gas along the line of sight. For the\nfirst time, our data reveal the spatially resolved morphology of the low\nfrequency free-free absorption with a resolution of ~70 arcsec. Contrary to the\nexpectation that such absorption arises from unrelated low density HII regions\n(or their envelopes) along the line of sight, these data suggest that in this\ncase the absorbing medium is directly linked to the SNR itself. 3C~391 has been\nshown in a number of recent papers to be interacting with a molecular cloud.\nIndeed, it exhibits a number of signposts of SNR/molecular cloud shocks\nincluding OH (1720 MHz) masers and broad molecular emission lines. Comparison\nof the regions of strongest 74 MHz absorption with existing X-ray, IR, and\nmolecular data suggests that the free-free absorption originates from the\nSNR/molecular cloud shock boundaries due to ionized gas created from the\npassage of a J-type shock with a speed of ~100 km/s.

Previous integrated spectroscopy of all these\ngalaxies by Couch & Sharples (1987) had shown them to have strong Balmer line\nabsorption and an absence of [OII 3727] emission -- the defining\ncharacteristics of the``E+A'' spectral signature, indicative of an abrupt halt\nto a recent episode of quite vigorous star formation. We have used our spectral\ndata to determine the radial variation in the strength of Hdelta absorption in\nthese galaxies and hence map out the distribution of this recently formed\nstellar population. Such information provides important clues as to what\nphysical event might have been responsible for this quite dramatic change in\nstar formation activity in these galaxies' recent past. We find a diversity of\nbehaviour amongst these galaxies in terms of the radial variation in Hdelta\nabsorption: Four galaxies show little Hdelta absorption across their entire\nextent; it would appear they were misidentified as E+A galaxies in the earlier\nintegrated spectroscopic studies. The remainder show strong Hdelta absorption,\nwith a gradient that is either negative (Hdelta equivalent width decreasing\nwith radius), flat, or positive. By comparing with numerical simulations we\nsuggest that the first of these different types of radial behaviour provides\nevidence for a merger/interaction origin, whereas the latter two types of\nbehaviour are more consistent with the truncation of star formation in normal\ndisk galaxies. It would seem therefore that more than one physical mechanism is\nresponsible for E+A formation in the same environment.",

Extending to formal linear combinations x=Sum_i(a_i M_i) yields a\nsesquilinear pairing p=<,> with values in (formal linear combinations of)\nclosed manifolds. Topological quantum field theory (TQFT) represents this\nuniversal pairing p onto a finite dimensional quotient pairing q with values in\nC which in physically motivated cases is positive definite. To see if such a\n\"unitary\" TQFT can potentially detect any nontrivial x, we ask if <x,x> is\nnon-zero whenever x is non-zero. If this is the case, we call the pairing p\npositive. The question arises for each dimension d=0,1,2,.... We find p(d)\npositive for d=0,1, and 2 and not positive for d=4. We conjecture that p(3) is\nalso positive. Similar questions may be phrased for (manifold, submanifold)\npairs and manifolds with other additional structure. The results in dimension 4\nimply that unitary TQFTs cannot distinguish homotopy equivalent simply\nconnected 4-manifolds, nor can they distinguish smoothly s-cobordant\n4-manifolds. This may illuminate the difficulties that have been met by several\nauthors in their attempts to formulate unitary TQFTs for d=3+1. There is a\nfurther physical implication of this paper. Whereas 3-dimensional Chern-Simons\ntheory appears to be well-encoded within 2-dimensional quantum physics, eg in\nthe fractional quantum Hall effect, Donaldson-Seiberg-Witten theory cannot be\ncaptured by a 3-dimensional quantum system. The positivity of the physical\nHilbert spaces means they cannot see null vectors of the universal pairing;\nsuch vectors must map to zero.",

    "summary": "Geometric phases have stimulated researchers for its potential applications\nin many areas of science. One of them is fault-tolerant quantum computation. A\npreliminary requisite of quantum computation is the implementation of\ncontrolled logic gates by controlled dynamics of qubits. In controlled\ndynamics, one qubit undergoes coherent evolution and acquires appropriate\nphase, depending on the state of other qubits. If the evolution is geometric,\nthen the phase acquired depend only on the geometry of the path executed, and\nis robust against certain types of errors. This phenomenon leads to an\ninherently fault-tolerant quantum computation.\n  Here we suggest a technique of using non-adiabatic geometric phase for\nquantum computation, using selective excitation. In a two-qubit system, we\nselectively evolve a suitable subsystem where the control qubit is in state\n|1>, through a closed circuit. By this evolution, the target qubit gains a\nphase controlled by the state of the control qubit. Using these geometric phase\ngates we demonstrate implementation of Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm and Grover's\nsearch algorithm in a two-qubit system.",

    "summary": "In a series of recent papers Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard introduce an\nattractive class of continuous time stochastic volatility models for financial\nassets where the volatility processes are functions of positive\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck(OU) processes. This models are known to be substantially\nmore flexible than Gaussian based models. One current problem of this approach\nis the unavailability of a tractable exact analysis of likelihood based\nstochastic volatility models for the returns of log prices of stocks.\n  With this point in mind, the likelihood models of Barndorff-Nielsen and\nShephard are viewed as members of a much larger class of models. That is\nlikelihoods based on n conditionally independent Normal random variables whose\nmean and variance are representable as linear functionals of a common\nunobserved Poisson random measure. The analysis of these models is facilitated\nby applying the methods in James (2005, 2002), in particular an Esscher type\ntransform of Poisson random measures; in conjunction with a special case of the\nWeber-Sonine formula. It is shown that the marginal likelihood may be expressed\nin terms of a multidimensional Fourier-cosine transform. This yields tractable\nforms of the likelihood and also allows a full Bayesian posterior analysis of\nthe integrated volatility process. A general formula for the posterior density\nof the log price given the observed data is derived, which could potentially\nhave applications to option pricing. We extend the models to include leverage\neffects in section 5. It is shown that inference does not necessarily require\nsimulation of random measures. Rather, classical numerical integration can be\nused in the most general cases.",

The BNS models produce\nlikelihoods for aggregate returns which can be viewed as a subclass of latent\nregression models where one has n conditionally independent Normal random\nvariables whose mean and variance are representable as linear functionals of a\ncommon unobserved Poisson random measure. James (2005b) recently obtains an\nexact analysis for such models yielding expressions of the likelihood in terms\nof quite tractable Fourier-Cosine integrals. Here, our idea is to analyze a\nclass of likelihoods, which can be used for similar purposes, but where the\nlatent regression models are based on n conditionally independent models with\ndistributions belonging to a subclass of the generalized hyperbolic\ndistributions and whose corresponding parameters are representable as linear\nfunctionals of a common unobserved Poisson random measure. Our models are\nperhaps most closely related to the Normal inverse Gaussian/GARCH/A-PARCH\nmodels of Brandorff-Nielsen (1997) and Jensen and Lunde (2001), where in our\ncase the GARCH component is replaced by quantities such as INT-OU processes. It\nis seen that, importantly, such likelihood models exhibit quite different\nfeatures structurally. One nice feature of the model is that it allows for more\nflexibility in terms of modelling of external regression parameters.",

Detailed analysis of the two organisms also shows that\nthe evolutionary rates of interacting proteins are not sufficiently similar to\nbe mutually predictive.\n  It appears that meaningful inferences about the evolution of protein\ninteraction networks require comparative analysis of reasonably closely related\nspecies.

The author has developed a\ngeneral systems theory for the observed self-organized criticality applicable\nto dynamical systems of all space-time scales based on the concept that spatial\nintegration of enclosed small-scale fluctuations results in the formation of\nlarge eddy circulation. The eddy energy spectrum therefore represents the\nstatistical normal distribution according to the Central Limit Theorem. The\nadditive amplitudes of eddies, when squared (variance or eddy kinetic energy),\nrepresent the statistical normal (probability) distribution, a result observed\nin the subatomic dynamics of quantum systems. The model predicts Kepler's laws\nof planetary motion for eddy circulation dynamics. Inverse square law of\ngravitation therefore applies to the eddy continuum ranging from subatomic to\nmacro-scale dynamical systems, e.g. weather systems. The model is similar to a\nsuperstring model for subatomic dynamics which unifies quantum mechanical and\nclassical concepts and manifestation of matter is visualised as vibrational\nmodes in string-like energy flow patterns. The cumulative sum of centripetal\nforces in a hierarchy of vortex circulations may result in the observed inverse\nsquare law form for gravitational attraction between inertial masses of the\neddies.",

The validity of this approach is studied in detail for a uniform\ndistribution of hollow spheres where the fractional volume of the central\ninclusion is varied. We apply the results to two different areas of interest,\ni) infrared spectroscopy and ii) polarization of scattered light. The effects\nof particle size and shape on the optical characteristics are discussed. We\ncompare the results using the distribution of hollow spheres with those\nobtained by using randomly oriented spheroids. Also we compare the results with\nobservations and laboratory measurements. The distribution of hollow spheres is\nvery successful in reproducing laboratory measurements of the scattering angle\ndistribution of the degree of linear polarization for incident unpolarized\nlight of randomly oriented irregular quartz particles. Furthermore, we show\nthat we are able to derive the size distribution of dust grains by fitting the\nmeasured degree of linear polarization using computational result for hollow\nspheres. It is shown that the distribution of hollow spheres is a powerful tool\nfor studying light scattering, absorption and emission by cosmic dust grains\nand in particular when large numbers of particle parameters need to be\nconsidered since the computational demand of the distribution of hollow spheres\nis small.",

For NGC 185 we deduce that star formation was probably\nstill active about 4 x 10^8 yr ago. Key abundance-related results are: (1) We\nidentify ancient stars with [Fe/H] <~ -1.5 dex by a well-defined horizontal\nbranch (HB). (2) We find a prominent RGB/ faint-AGB clump/ bump- like feature\nwith the same mean V-band magnitude as the HB, within uncertainties; from a\ncomparison with theory, ancient stars have [Fe/H] ~ -1.5 dex, with a higher\nabundance level for intermediate-age stars. (3) From colour information we\ninfer that the median [Fe/H] > -1.11 +/- 0.08 dex for ancient stars. For NGC\n205, we record (m-M)o = 24.76 +/- 0.1 mag, based on the RGB I-band tip\nmagnitude method. We find that stars were probably still forming less than 3 x\n10^8 yr ago, which is compatible with star formation triggered by an\ninteraction with M31. Key abundance-related results are: (1) The RGB/ faint-AGB\nis significantly skewed to redder values than that of a control field in the\noutskirts of M31; it probably results from a relatively narrow metallicity and\nor age range for a significant fraction of the dwarf's stars. (2) For ancient\nstars we infer from colour information that the median [Fe/H] > -1.06+/-0.04\ndex. We briefly compare the stellar populations of NGC 205, NGC 185 and NGC\n147.\n  Finally, we find an apparent blue excess in the outer region of the nuclear\nstar cluster in NGC 205. It is as compact as a typical galactic globular\ncluster, but is quite bright (10^6 L_solar,R); and by matching its blue colour\nwith models, its stellar population is young, up to a few times 10^8 yr old.",

    "summary": "An experimental setting for the polarimetric study of optically induced\ndynamical behavior in nematic liquid crystal films has allowed to identify most\nnotably some behavior which was recognized as gluing bifurcations leading to\nchaos. This analysis of the data used a comparison with a model for the\ntransition to chaos via gluing bifurcations in optically excited nematic liquid\ncrystals previously proposed by G. Demeter and L. Kramer. The model of these\nlast authors, proposed about twenty years before, does not have the central\nsymmetry which one would expect for minimal dimensional models for chaos in\nnematics in view of the time series. What we show here is that the simplest\ntruncated normal forms for gluing, with the appropriate symmetry and minimal\ndimension, do exhibit time signals that are embarrassingly similar to the ones\nfound using the above mentioned experimental settings. The gluing bifurcation\nscenario itself is only visible in limited parameter ranges and substantial\naspect of the chaos that can be observed is due to other factors. First, out of\nthe immediate neighborhood of the homoclinic curve, nonlinearity can produce\nexpansion leading to chaos when combined with the recurrence induced by the\nhomoclinic behavior. Also, pairs of symmetric homoclinic orbits create extreme\nsensitivity to noise, so that when the noiseless approach contains a rich\nbehavior, minute noise can transform the complex damping into sustained chaos.\nLeonid Shil'nikov taught us that combining global considerations and local\nspectral analysis near critical points is crucial to understand the\nphenomenology associated to homoclinic bifurcations. Here this helps us\nconstruct a phenomenological approach to modeling experiments in nonlinear\ndissipative contexts.",

Spectroscopic identifications have\nbeen obtained for 80 (44%); some additional ones are secure based on radio\ndetections or optical morphology, although yet unobserved spectroscopically.\nThese spectroscopic identifications include 13 Sy 1 galaxies, 17 Sy 2 Seyferts,\n29 starbursts, 7 LINER systems, and 13 emission-line galaxies so heavily\nreddened as to remain of ambiguous classification. The optical magnitudes range\nfrom R=12.0-20.5; counts suggest that incompleteness is important fainter than\nR=15.5. Redshifts extend to z=0.51, with a significant part of the sample at\nz>0.2. The sample includes slightly more AGN than star-forming systems among\nthose where the spectra contain enough diagnostic feature to make the\ndistinction. The active nuclei include several broad-line objects with strong\nFe II emission, and composite objects with the absorption-line signatures of\nfading starbursts. These AGN with warm far-IR colors have little overlap with\nthe \"red AGN\" identified with 2MASS; only a single Sy 1 was detected by 2MASS\nwith J-K > 2. Some reliable IRAS detections have either very faint optical\ncounterparts or only absorption-line galaxies, potentially being deeply\nobscured AGN. The IRAS detections include a newly identified symbiotic star,\nand several possible examples of the \"Vega phenomenon\", including dwarfs as\ncool as type K. Appendices detail these candidate stars, and the\noptical-identification content of a particularly deep set of high-latitude IRAS\nscans (probing the limits of optical identification from IRAS data alone).",

In the regime where these memory-lengths\nare all small, the average winnings per agent exceed those obtained for either\n(1) a pure population where all agents have equal memory-length, or (2) a mixed\npopulation comprising sub-populations of equal-memory agents with each\nsub-population having a different memory-length. Agents who consistently play\nstrategies of a given memory-length, are found to win more on average --\nswitching between strategies with different memory lengths incurs an effective\npenalty, while switching between strategies of equal memory does not. Agents\nemploying short-memory strategies can outperform agents using long-memory\nstrategies, even in the regime where an equal-memory system would have favored\nthe use of long-memory strategies. Using the many-body `Crowd-Anticrowd'\ntheory, we obtain analytic expressions which are in good agreement with the\nobserved numerical results.

Within DMFT we study the density of states and the dc-resistivity,\nwhich are strongly parameter dependent such as temperature, doping, density of\nthe carriers, and the strength of the carrier-local impurity spin exchange\ncoupling. Characteristic qualitative features are found distinguishing weak,\nintermediate, and strong carrier-spin coupling and allowing quantitative\ndetermination of important parameters defining the underlying ferromagnetic\nmechanism. We find that spin-disorder scattering, formation of bound state, and\nthe population of the minority spin band are all operational in DMFT in\ndifferent parameter range. We also develop a complementary Boltzmann transport\ntheory for scattering by screened ionized impurities. The difference in the\nscreening properties between paramagnetic ($T>T_c$) and ferromagnetic ($T<T_c$)\nstates gives rise to the temperature dependence (increase or decrease) of\nresistivity, depending on the carrier density, as the system goes from the\nparamagnetic phase to the ferromagnetic phase.

Then, for each positive integer $k$, the map $j_g$\ninduces a restriction map $$R_g \\colon H^{k}(S, {\\Bbb C})\\to H^{k}(S(H,g),\n{\\Bbb C}).$$ In this paper we focus on symmetric spaces associated to the\nunitary and orthogonal groups, namely $O(p,q)$ and $U(p,q)$, and give explicit\ncriterions for the injectivity of the product of the maps $R_g$ (for $g$\nrunning through $G({\\Bbb Q})$) when restricted to the strongly primitive (in\nthe sense of Vogan and Zuckerman) part of the cohomology. We also give explicit\ncriterions for the injectivity of the map $$H^{k}(S(H), {\\Bbb C}) \\to H^{k+{\\rm\ndim} S - {\\rm dim} S(H)} (S, {\\Bbb C})$$ dual to the restriction map $R_e$.\n  The results we obtain fit into a larger conjectural picture that we describe\nand which bare a strong analogy with the classical Lefschetz Theorems. This may\nsound quite surprising that such an analogy still exists in the case of the\nreal arithmetic manifolds. We finally derive some applications concerning the\nnon vanishing of some cohomology classes in arithmetic manifolds.",

Using this trial function an\napproximation to the full complex energy bound-state spectrum is computed.

    "summary": "Recent studies have revealed strong correlations between 1-10 Hz frequencies\nof quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) and the spectral power law index of\nseveral Black Hole (BH) candidate sources when seen in the low/hard state, the\nsteep power-law (soft) state, and in transition between these states. In the\nsoft state these index-QPO frequency correlations show a saturation of the\nphoton index about 2.7 at high values of the low frequency. This saturation\neffect was previously identified as a black hole signature. In this paper we\nargue that this saturation does not occur, at least for one neutron star (NS)\nsource 4U 1728-34, for which the index monotonically increases with the low\nfrequency to the values of 6 and higher. We base this conclusion on our\nanalysis about 1.5 Msec of RXTE archival data for 4U 1728-34. We reveal the\nspectral evolution of the Comptonized blackbody spectra when the source\ntransitions from the hard to soft states. The hard state spectrum is a typical\nthermal Comptonization spectrum of the soft photons which originate in the disk\nand the NS outer photospheric layers. The hard state photon index is about 2.\nThe soft state spectrum consists of two blackbody components which are only\nslightly Comptonized. Thus we can claim (as expected from theory) that in NS\nsources thermal equilibrium is established for the soft state. To the contrary\nin BH sources, the equilibrium is never established due to the presence of the\nBH horizon. The emergent BH spectrum, even in the high/soft state, has a power\nlaw component. We also show that the presence of Fe K_alpha emission-line\nstrengths, QPOs, and the link between them does not depend on radio flux in 4U\n1728-34.",

A large number of real\nnetworks are called ``scale-free'' because they show a power-law distribution\nof the number of links per node \\cite{ab-review,barabasi1999,faloutsos}.\nHowever, it is widely believed that complex networks are not {\\it length-scale}\ninvariant or self-similar. This conclusion originates from the ``small-world''\nproperty of these networks, which implies that the number of nodes increases\nexponentially with the ``diameter'' of the network\n\\cite{erdos,bollobas,milgram,watts}, rather than the power-law relation\nexpected for a self-similar structure. Nevertheless, here we present a novel\napproach to the analysis of such networks, revealing that their structure is\nindeed self-similar. This result is achieved by the application of a\nrenormalization procedure which coarse-grains the system into boxes containing\nnodes within a given \"size\". Concurrently, we identify a power-law relation\nbetween the number of boxes needed to cover the network and the size of the box\ndefining a finite self-similar exponent. These fundamental properties, which\nare shown for the WWW, social, cellular and protein-protein interaction\nnetworks, help to understand the emergence of the scale-free property in\ncomplex networks. They suggest a common self-organization dynamics of diverse\nnetworks at different scales into a critical state and in turn bring together\npreviously unrelated fields: the statistical physics of complex networks with\nrenormalization group, fractals and critical phenomena.",

    "summary": "The rotation velocity of the spiral pattern of the Galaxy is determined by\ndirect observation of the birthplaces of open clusters of stars in the galactic\ndisk as a function of their age. Our measurement does not depend on any\nspecific model of the spiral structure, like the existence of a given number of\nspiral arms, or the presence of a bar in the central regions. This study became\npossible due to the recent completion of a large database on open clusters by\nour group. The birthplaces of the clusters are determined by two methods, one\nthat assumes that the orbits are circular, and the other by integrating the\norbits in the Galactic potential for a time equal to the age of the clusters.\nWe selected in the database a sample of 212 clusters for which proper motions,\nradial velocities, distances and ages are available, or of 612 clusters that\nhave ages and distances available. We tested different assumptions concerning\nthe rotation curve and the radius $R_0$ of the solar orbit. Our results confirm\nthat a dominant fraction of the open clusters are formed in spiral arms, and\nthat the spiral arms rotate like a rigid body, as predicted by the classical\ntheory of spiral waves. We find that the corotation radius $R_c$ is close to\nthe solar galactic orbit ($R_c/R_0 = 1.08 \\pm 0.08$). This proximity has many\npotentially interesting consequences, like a better preservation of life on the\nEarth, and a new understanding of the history of star formation in the solar\nneighborhood, and of the evolution of the abundance of elements in the galactic\ndisk.",

    "summary": "The onset of thermalization in heavy ion collisions in the weak coupling\nframework can be viewed as a transition from the initial state Color Glass\nCondensate dynamics, characterized by the energy density scaling like $\\epsilon\n\\sim 1/\\tau$ with $\\tau$ the proper time, to the hydrodynamics-driven expansion\nof the quark-gluon plasma with $\\epsilon \\sim 1/\\tau^{4/3}$ (or higher power of\n$1/\\tau$ for the boost non-invariant case). We argue that, at any order of the\nperturbative expansion in the QCD coupling constant, the gluon field generated\nin an ultrarelativistic heavy ion collision leads to energy density scaling as\n$\\epsilon \\sim 1/\\tau$ for late times $\\tau \\gg 1/Q_s$. Therefore it is likely\nthat thermalization and hydrodynamic description of the gluon system produced\nin heavy ion collisions can not result from perturbative QCD diagrams at these\nlate times. At earlier times with $\\tau \\sim 1/Q_s$ the subleading corrections\nto $\\epsilon$ in $1/\\tau$ expansion (terms scaling like $\\sim\n1/\\tau^{1+\\Delta}$ with $\\Delta >0$) may become important possibly leading to\nhydrodynamic-like behavior of the gluon system. Still, we show that such\ncorrections do not contribute to the particle production cross section, and are\nlikely to be irrelevant for physical observables. We generalize our results by\nincluding massless quarks into the system. Thus, it appears that the apparent\nthermalization of quarks and gluons, leading to success of Bjorken\nhydrodynamics in describing heavy ion collisions at RHIC, can only be\nattributed to the non-perturbative QCD effects.",

This filter is combined with the standard Johnson-Kron-Cousins B, V,\nand I bandpasses to constitute the uBVI photometric system.\n  Model stellar atmospheres are used to calibrate color-color diagrams for the\nuBVI system in terms of the fundamental stellar parameters of effective\ntemperature, surface gravity, and metallicity. The u-B index is very sensitive\nto log g, but also to [Fe/H]. It is shown that an analog of the Str\\\"omgren c_1\nindex, defined as (u-B)-(B-V), is much less metallicity dependent, but still\nsensitive to log g. The effect of interstellar reddening on u-B is determined\nthrough synthetic photometric calculations, and practical advice is given on\ndealing with flat fields, atmospheric extinction, the red leak in the u filter,\nand photometric reductions.\n  The uBVI system offers a wide range of applicability in detecting stars of\nhigh luminosity in both young (yellow supergiants) and old (post-AGB stars)\npopulations, using stars of both types as standard candles to measure\nextragalactic distances with high efficiency, and in exploring the horizontal\nbranch in globular clusters.

By\nmeasuring velocity dispersions of various subsamples of galaxies in this\ncomposite cluster, we found that bright cluster galaxies (Mz<-23) have\nsignificantly smaller velocity dispersion than faint galaxies (Mz>-23). We\ninterpret this as direct evidence of the dynamical interaction/friction between\ncluster galaxies, where massive galaxies lose their velocity through the energy\nequipartition during the dynamical interaction/friction with less massive\ngalaxies. We also found that star-forming late-type galaxies have a larger\nvelocity dispersion than passive late-type galaxies. This is inconsistent with\nthe ram-pressure stripping model; since the ram-pressure is proportional to\nsigma v^2 (i.e., stronger for galaxies with high velocity), the ram-pressure\nstripping cannot explain the observed trends of passive (evolved) galaxies\nhaving low velocity rather than high velocity. On the other hand, the result is\nagain consistent with the dynamical galaxy-galaxy interaction/friction, where\nmore evolved (passive) galaxies lose their velocity through dynamical\ninteraction/friction.",

Lomb Periodogram analyses indicate the presence of two\ndistinct periods of ~61 days and 8 days in both the quasi-flat and the periodic\nsegments. Minima of the periodic segment cover at least 50% of the orbital\nperiod and contain spikes of light with the 8-day period; maxima do not show\nthis short period. The system typically shows maxima to be redder than minima.\nThe most recent OGLE-III light curve shows only a 30-day periodicity. The\nvariable's V and R magnitudes and color are those of a Be star, and recent sets\nof near infrared spectra four days apart, secured during the time of the\nOGLE-III data, show H-alpha emission near and at a maximum, confirming its Be\nstar characteristics. The model that best fits the photometric behavior\nconsists of a thin ring-like circumstellar disk of low mass with four obscuring\nsectors orbiting the central B star in unison at the 61-day period. The central\nstar peers through the three equi- spaced separations between the four sectors\nproducing the 8-day period. The remainder of the disk contains hydrogen in\nemission making maxima appear redder. A companion star of lower mass in an\ninclined and highly eccentric orbit produces an impulsive perturbation near its\nperiastron to change the disk's orientation, changing eclipses from partial to\ncomplete within ~ 10 days.",

    "summary": "Understanding the structure of the Internet graph is a crucial step for\nbuilding accurate network models and designing efficient algorithms for\nInternet applications. Yet, obtaining its graph structure is a surprisingly\ndifficult task, as edges cannot be explicitly queried. Instead, empirical\nstudies rely on traceroutes to build what are essentially single-source,\nall-destinations, shortest-path trees. These trees only sample a fraction of\nthe network's edges, and a recent paper by Lakhina et al. found empirically\nthat the resuting sample is intrinsically biased. For instance, the observed\ndegree distribution under traceroute sampling exhibits a power law even when\nthe underlying degree distribution is Poisson.\n  In this paper, we study the bias of traceroute sampling systematically, and,\nfor a very general class of underlying degree distributions, calculate the\nlikely observed distributions explicitly. To do this, we use a continuous-time\nrealization of the process of exposing the BFS tree of a random graph with a\ngiven degree distribution, calculate the expected degree distribution of the\ntree, and show that it is sharply concentrated. As example applications of our\nmachinery, we show how traceroute sampling finds power-law degree distributions\nin both delta-regular and Poisson-distributed random graphs. Thus, our work\nputs the observations of Lakhina et al. on a rigorous footing, and extends them\nto nearly arbitrary degree distributions.",

The initial stellar models are\nrelativistic polytropes which are dynamically unstable and with angular\nvelocities ranging from slow rotation to the mass-shedding limit. An essential\naspect of these simulations is the use of progressive mesh-refinement\ntechniques which allow to move the outer boundaries of the computational domain\nto regions where gravitational radiation attains its asymptotic form. The\nwaveforms have been extracted using a gauge-invariant approach in which the\nnumerical spacetime is matched with the non-spherical perturbations of a\nSchwarzschild spacetime. Overall, the results indicate that the waveforms have\nfeatures related to the properties of the initial stellar models (in terms of\ntheir w-mode oscillations) and of the newly produced rotating black holes (in\nterms of their quasi-normal modes). While our waveforms are in good qualitative\nagreement with those computed by Stark and Piran in two-dimensional\nsimulations, our amplitudes are about one order of magnitude smaller and this\ndifference is mostly likely due to our less severe pressure reduction. For a\nneutron star rotating uniformly near mass-shedding and collapsing at 10 kpc,\nthe signal-to-noise ratio computed uniquely from the burst is S/N ~ 0.25, but\nthis grows to be S/N <~ 4 in the case of LIGO II.",

The\nslice width (100 Mpc) corresponds to the photometric redshift accuracy\n(\\Delta_z\\sim 0.15).\n  We used mock catalogs from the GIF2 cosmological simulations to show that\nthis redshift resolution is sufficient to statistically differentiate the high\ndensity regions from the low density regions using $\\Sigma_5$, the projected\ndensity to the 5th nearest neighbor. These mock catalogs have a redshift depth\nof 100 Mpc, similar to our slice width.\n  The large area of the MOSAIC images, 40x40 Mpc (co-moving) per field, allows\nus to measure the SFR from the dust-corrected UV continuum as a function of\n$\\Sigma_5$. In contrast to low-redshift galaxies, we find that the SFR (or UV\nluminosity) of LBGs at z=3 shows no detectable dependence on environment over 2\norders of magnitude in density.\n  To test the significance of our result, we use Monte Carlo simulations (from\nthe mock catalogs) and the same projected density estimators we applied to our\ndata. We find that we can reject the steep z=0 SFR-density at the 5-$\\sigma$\nlevel. We conclude that the SFR-density at z=3 must be at least 3.6 times\nflatter than it is locally, i.e. the SFR of LBGs is significantly less\ndependent on environment than the SFR of local star-forming galaxies.

    "summary": "We present the analysis of an extensive set of high resolution spectroscopic\nobservations of HD93161, a visual binary with a separation of 2 arcsec. HD93161\nA is a spectroscopic binary, with both components clearly detected throughout\nthe orbit. The primary star is most probably of spectral type O8V, while the\nsecondary is likely an O9V. We obtain the first orbital solution for this\nsystem, characterized by a period of 8.566\\pm0.004 days. The minimum masses of\nthe primary and secondary stars are 22.2\\pm0.6 M_sol and 17.0\\pm0.4 M_sol\nrespectively. These values are quite large, suggesting a high inclination of\nthe orbit. The second object, HD93161 B, displays an O6.5V((f)) spectral type\nand is thus slightly hotter than its neighbour. This star is at first sight\nsingle but presents radial velocity variations. We finally study HD93161 in the\nX-ray domain. No significant variability is detected. The X-ray spectrum is\nwell described by a 2T model with kT_1~0.3keV and kT_2~0.7keV. The X-ray\nluminosity is rather moderate, without any large emission excess imputable to a\nwind interaction.",

The purpose is to test the possibility of describing such a far\nfrom equilibrium dynamics with simplified kinetic models. The motivation is\nalso in turn to assess the relevance of some singular features appearing within\nthe original model and the approximations invoked to study it. The scaling\nexponents are first obtained from the (simplified) Boltzmann equation, and are\nconfronted against Monte Carlo simulation (DSMC technique). Then, the\nChapman-Enskog method is used to obtain constitutive relations and transport\ncoefficients. The corresponding Navier-Stokes equations for the hydrodynamic\nfields are derived for both Maxwell and VHP models.

A non-standard temperature dependence of the observed thermal expansion\nwas modelled as a sum of three contributions: (1) Weighted sum of lattice\nexpansions of the cobaltite in the diamagnetic low spin state and in the\nintermediate (IS) or high (HS) spin state. (2) An anomalous expansion due to\nthe increasing population of excited (IS or HS) states of Co3+ ions at the\ncourse of the diamagnetic-paramagnetic transition. (3) An anomalous expansion\ndue to excitations of Co3+ ions to another paramagnetic state accompanied by an\ninsulator-metal transition. The anomalous expansion is governed by parameters\nthat are found to vary linearly with the Ln ionic radius. In the case of the\nfirst magnetic transition it is the energy splitting E between the ground low\nspin state and the excited state, presumably the intermediate spin state. The\nenergy splitting E, determined by a fit of magnetic susceptibility, decreases\nwith temperature.

Combined with short\ntimescale XMM-Newton observations, we derive the powerspectral density (PSD)\ncovering 6 decades from ~10^{-8} to ~10^{-2} Hz. As with NGC4051, another NLS1,\nthe PSD of MCG-6-30-15 is a close analogue of the PSD of a Galactic Black Hole\nX-ray binary system (GBH) in a `high' rather than a `low' state. Like high\nstate GBHs, its PSD is better fitted by a smoothly bending rather than sharply\nbreaking powerlaw model and the break frequency is 7.6^{+10}_{-3} x 10^{-5} Hz.\nAssuming linear scaling of break frequency with mass, we estimate the black\nhole (BH) mass in MCG-6-30-15 to be ~2.9^{+1.8}_{-1.6} X 10^{6} solar masses.\nWe also derive the BH mass using a variety of new optical observations and find\na value between 3.6 and 6 x 10^{6} solar masses, consistent with the mass\nderived from the PSD. Combining these data with revised reverberation masses\nfor other AGN we update the BH mass/break timescale diagram. The observations\nare consistent with NLS1s having shorter break timescales, for a given mass,\nthan broad line AGN, probably reflecting a higher accretion rate. However the\ndata are also consistent with all of the X-ray bright AGN being high state\nobjects. This result may simply be a selection effect, based on their selection\nfrom X-ray all sky catalogues, and their consequent typically high X-ray/radio\nratios, which indicate high state systems.",

    "summary": "Up to now, transverse quantum effects (usually labelled as \"quantum imaging\"\neffects) which are generated by nonlinear devices inserted in resonant optical\ncavities have been calculated using the \"thin crystal approximation\", i.e.\ntaking into account the effect of diffraction only inside the empty part of the\ncavity, and neglecting its effect in the nonlinear propagation inside the\nnonlinear crystal. We introduce in the present paper a theoretical method which\nis not restricted by this approximation. It allows us in particular to treat\nconfigurations closer to the actual experimental ones, where the crystal length\nis comparable to the Rayleigh length of the cavity mode. We use this method in\nthe case of the confocal OPO, where the thin crystal approximation predicts\nperfect squeezing on any area of the transverse plane, whatever its size and\nshape. We find that there exists in this case a \"coherence length\" which gives\nthe minimum size of a detector on which perfect squeezing can be observed, and\nwhich gives therefore a limit to the improvement of optical resolution that can\nbe obtained using such devices.",

We calculate the absorption cross\nsection for a range of gravitational couplings Mm/m_P^2 and incident particle\nenergies E. At high couplings, where the Schwarzschild radius R_S is much\ngreater than the wavelength lambda, we find that the cross section approaches\nthe classical result for a point particle. At intermediate couplings we find\noscillations around the classical limit whose precise form depends on the\nparticle mass. These oscillations give quantum violations of the equivalence\nprinciple. At high energies the cross section converges on the geometric-optics\nvalue of 27 \\pi R_S^2/4, and at low energies we find agreement with an\napproximation derived by Unruh.

Using the BzK selection criterion we have pre-selected a\nset of objects over the UDF which fulfill the photometric conditions for being\npassively evolving galaxies at z>1.4. Low-resolution spectra of these objects\nhave been extracted from the HST+ACS grism data taken over the UDF by the\nGRAPES project. Redshift for the 7 galaxies have been identified based on the\nUV feature at rest frame 2640<lambda<2850 AA. This feature is mainly due to a\ncombination of FeII, MgI and MgII absorptions which are characteristic of\nstellar populations dominated by stars older than about 0.5 Gyr. The redshift\nidentification and the passively evolving nature of these galaxies is further\nsupported by the photometric redshifts and by the overall spectral energy\ndistribution (SED), with the ultradeep HST+ACS/NICMOS imaging revealing compact\nmorphologies typical of elliptical/early-type galaxies. From the SED we derive\nstellar masses of 10^{11}Msun or larger and ages of about 1 Gyr. Their space\ndensity at < z >=1.7 appears to be roughly a factor of 2--3 smaller than that\nof their local counterparts, further supporting the notion that such massive\nand old galaxies are already ubiquitous at early cosmic times. Much smaller\neffective radii are derived for some of the objects compared to local massive\nellipticals, which may be due to morphological K corrections, evolution, or the\npresence of a central point-like source. Nuclear activity is indeed present in\na subset of the galaxies, as revealed by them being hard X-ray sources, hinting\nto AGN activity having played a role in discontinuing star formation.",

The condition for this tendency is that of a strong magnetic field,\ncorresponding to large values of the dimensionless Hartmann number (Ha >> 1).\nThis is analogous to the case of low Ekman number rotating flows, with Ekman\nlayers replacing Hartmann layers. This has been at the origin of the\nhomogeneous model for flows in a rotating frame of reference, with its rich\nstructure: geostrophic contours and shear layers of Stewartson, Munk and\nStommel. In magnetohydrodynamics, the characteristic surfaces introduced by\nKulikovskii play a role similar to the role of the geostrophic contours.\nHowever, a general theory for quasi two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics is\nlacking. In this paper, a model is proposed which provides a general framework\nfor quasi two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic flows. Not only can this model\naccount for otherwise disconnected past results, but it is also used to predict\na new type of shear layer, of typical thickness Ha^{-1/4}.",

    "summary": "The Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft yielded the most precise navigation in deep\nspace to date. However, while at heliocentric distance of $\\sim$ 20--70 AU, the\naccuracies of their orbit reconstructions were limited by a small, anomalous,\nDoppler frequency drift. This drift can be interpreted as a sunward constant\nacceleration of $a_P = (8.74 \\pm 1.33)\\times 10^{-8}$ cm/s$^2$ which is now\ncommonly known as the Pioneer anomaly. Here we discuss the Pioneer anomaly and\npresent the next steps towards understanding of its origin. They are: 1)\nAnalysis of the entire set of existing Pioneer 10 and 11 data, obtained from\nlaunch to the last telemetry received from Pioneer 10, on 27 April 2002, when\nit was at a heliocentric distance of 80 AU. This data could yield critical new\ninformation about the anomaly. If the anomaly is confirmed, 2) Development of\nan instrumental package to be operated on a deep space mission to provide an\nindependent confirmation on the anomaly. If further confirmed, 3) Development\nof a deep-space experiment to explore the Pioneer anomaly in a dedicated\nmission with an accuracy for acceleration resolution at the level of $10^{-10}$\ncm/s$^2$ in the extremely low frequency range. In Appendices we give a summary\nof the Pioneer anomaly's characteristics, outline in more detail the steps\nneeded to perform an analysis of the entire Pioneer data set, and also discuss\nthe possibility of extracting some useful information from the Cassini mission\ncruise data.",

The likely origin of the X-ray\nemission is cooling plasma in the boundary layer settling onto the white dwarf.\nUsing a cooling flow model, we derive the temperatures, accretion rates,\nrotational velocities, and elemental abundances of the X-ray emitting gas. We\ndiscuss the implications of our findings for the structure of the boundary\nlayer. A comparison of X-ray and ultraviolet luminosities finds no evidence of\nunderluminous boundary layers in any of the quiescent dwarf novae. The X-ray\nspectrum of EI UMa differs significantly from those of the other objects,\nshowing a strong fluorescent Fe K-alpha line and a strong O VII line triplet.\nBased on the observational evidence, we argue that EI UMa is most likely an\nintermediate polar and not as previously thought a dwarf nova.",

Either high\nresolution CMB anisotropy observations or 21 cm fluctuations at redshifts 30\nand higher can be used to delens polarization data and to separate\ngravitational-wave polarization signature from that of cosmic-shear related\nsignal.

Beyond CMB polarization, at frequencies\nbetween 0.01 Hz to 1 Hz, space-based laser interferometers can also be used to\nprobe the inflationary gravitational wave background. The confusion here is\nrelated to the removal of merging neutron star binaries at cosmological\ndistances.

    "summary": "In the context of split supersymmetry, the gaugino mass spectrum seems to be\nvery important to satisfy the dark matter content of the universe and the gauge\ncoupling unification. In this paper, we have considered various sources of\ngaugino masses in the context of unified models. We show that the gaugino mass\nspectrum varies in different unification pictures. In the context of SU(5), we\nhave found that the Bino/Wino mass ratio can be close to one at the weak scale\nwhich is helpful to satisfy the WMAP data. The gluino/Wino mass ratio is also\ndifferent from the usual scenario of unified gaugino masses. The gaugino masses\ncan be around one TeV and m_SUSY is chosen so that the gluino mass does not\ncreate any cosmological problem. In the context of the Pati-Salam model, we\nshow that the gluino mass can be made very heavy even after maintaining the\nunification of the gauge couplings.",

Our primary data set for this search were the two J+H NICMOS\nparallel fields taken with the ACS HUDF. The 5 sigma limiting mags were 28.6 in\nJ and 28.5 in H. Several shallower fields were also used: J+H NICMOS frames\navailable over the HDF North, the HDF South NICMOS parallel, and the ACS HUDF.\nThe primary selection criterion was (J-H)>1.8. 11 such sources were found in\nall search fields using this criterion. 8 of these were clearly ruled out as\ncredible z~10 sources, either as a result of detections (>2 sigma) blueward of\nJ or their colors redward of the break (H-K~1.5). The nature of the 3 remaining\nsources could not be determined from the data. The number appears consistent\nwith the expected contamination from low-z interlopers. Analysis of the stacked\nimages for the 3 candidates also suggests contamination. Regardless of their\ntrue redshifts, the actual number of z~10 sources must be <=3. To assess the\nsignificance of these results, two lower redshift samples (a z~3.8 B-dropout\nand z~6 i-dropout sample) were projected to z~8-12 using a (1+z)^{-1} size\nscaling. They were added to the image frames, and the selection repeated,\ngiving 15.6 and 4.8 J-dropouts, respectively. This suggests that to the limit\nof this probe (0.3 L*) there has been evolution from z~3.8 and possibly from\nz~6. This is consistent with the strong evolution already noted at z~6 and\nz~7.5 relative to z~3-4. Even assuming that 3 sources from this probe are at\nz~10, the rest-frame continuum UV (~1500 A) luminosity density at z~10\n(integrated down to 0.3 L*) is just 0.19_{-0.09}^{+0.13}x that at z~3.8 (or\n0.19_{-0.10}^{+0.15}x including cosmic variance). However, if none of our\nsources is at z~10, this ratio has a 1 sigma upper limit of 0.07. (abridged)",

We use methods of quantum electrodynamics specially\nderived for the problem. It enables us to take into account excited-state\nradiation widths of atoms. Then we calculate the force between excited atom and\nmedium of ground-state atoms. The results are in agreement with the ones,\nobtained by other authors using perturbation theory or linear response theory.\nGeneralization of our results to the case of interaction between two media of\nexcited atoms results in a formula, which is in not only in quantitative, but\nin qualitative contradiction with Lifshits formula. This contradiction\ndisappears if media of ground-state atoms are taken. Moreover, our result does\nnot include permittivity of the media. It includes the quantity which differs\nfrom the permittivity only for excited atoms. The main features of our results\nare as follows. The interaction is resonant; the force may be either attractive\nor repulsive depending on resonant frequencies of the atoms of different media;\nthe value of Casimir force may be several orders of magnitude lager than that\npredicted by Lifshitz formula.

Frequent phase and flux referencing (every 5 minutes)\nwith the nearby calibrator source J1744-312 was employed to control for\ninstrumental and atmospheric effects. Time variations are sought by computing\nand subtracting, from each visibility in the database, an average visibility\nobtained from all the data acquired in our monitoring program having similar uv\nspacings. This removes the confusing effects of baseline-dependent, correlated\nflux interference caused by the static, thermal emission from the extended\nsource Sgr A West. Few-day variations up to ~20% and intra-day variability of\n\\~20% and in some cases up to ~40% on few-hour time scales emerge from the\ndifferenced data on SgrA*. Power spectra of the residuals indicate the presence\nof hourly variations on all but two of the eight days. Monte Carlo simulation\nof red-noise light curves indicates that the hourly variations are well\ndescribed by a red-noise power spectrum with P(f) ~ f^(-1). Of particular\ninterest is a ~2.5 hour variation seen prominently on two consecutive days. An\naverage power spectrum from all eight days of data reveals noteworthy power on\nthis time scale. There is some indication that few-hour variations are more\npronounced on days when the average daily flux is highest. We briefly discuss\nthe possibility that these few-hour variations are due to the dynamical\nmodulation of accreting gas around the central supermassive black hole, as well\nas the implications for the structure of the SgrA* photosphere at 3 mm.\nFinally, these data have enabled us to produce a high sensitivity 3-mm map of\nthe extended thermal emission surrounding SgrA*.",

Follow up VLA as well as\noptical and near-IR imaging and spectroscopy (Massey et al. 2003; Silva et al.\n2005) confirm that it is a low metallicity dwarf irregular galaxy. However\nthere were two puzzling aspects of the observations, (i) current star\nformation, as traced by H$\\alpha$ emission, is confined to a small region at\nthe edge of the VLA HI image and (ii) the metallicity of the older RGB stars is\nhigher than that of the gas in HII region. We present high spatial and velocity\nresolution Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT) observations that resolve\nthese puzzles by showing that HIZSS003 is actually a galaxy pair and that the\nHII region lies at the center of a much smaller companion galaxy (HIZSS003B) to\nthe main galaxy (HIZSS003A). The HI emission from these two galaxies overlaps\nin projection, but can be separated in velocity space. HIZSS003B has an HI mass\nof 2.6 X 10^6 M$_\\odot$, and a highly disturbed velocity field. Since the\nvelocity field is disturbed, an accurate rotation curve cannot be derived,\nhowever, the indicative dynamical mass is ~5 X 10^7 M$_\\odot$. For the bigger\ngalaxy HIZSS003A we derive an HI mass of 1.4 X 10^7 M$_\\odot$.

This mode is a dimensional crossover effect and\nreveals the presence of a limited amount of long-range antiferromagnetic order\nco-existing with quantum fluctuations. In this paper the existence of such a\nmode is confirmed in the model material KCuF3 using polarized and unpolarized\ninelastic neutron scattering and the longitudinal polarization of the mode is\ndefinitively established. The lineshape is broadened suggesting a reduced\nlifetime due to decay into spin-waves. In addition the data shows evidence of\ncontinuum scattering with a lower edge greater than the longitudinal mode\nenergy.

Moreover, any\ndeterminantal process can be represented as a mixture of determinantal\nprojection processes. We give a simple explanation for these known facts, and\nestablish analogous representations for permanental processes, with geometric\nvariables replacing the Bernoulli variables. These representations lead to\nsimple proofs of existence criteria and central limit theorems, and unify known\nresults on the distribution of absolute values in certain processes with\nradially symmetric distributions.",

    "summary": "We present a new study of the collisional runaway scenario to form an\nintermediate-mass black hole (IMBH, MBH > 100 Msun) at the centre of a young,\ncompact stellar cluster. The first phase is the formation of a very dense\ncentral core of massive stars (Mstar =~ 30-120 Msun) through mass segregation\nand gravothermal collapse. Previous work established the conditions for this to\nhappen before the massive stars evolve off the main sequence (MS). In this and\na companion paper, we investigate the next stage by implementing direct\ncollisions between stars. Using a Monte Carlo stellar dynamics code, we follow\nthe core collapse and subsequent collisional phase in more than 100 models with\nvarying cluster mass, size, and initial concentration. Collisions are treated\neither as ideal, ``sticky-sphere'' mergers or using realistic prescriptions\nderived from 3-D hydrodynamics computations. In all cases for which the core\ncollapse happens in less than the MS lifetime of massive stars (~3 Myr), we\nobtain the growth of a single very massive star (VMS, Mstar =~ 400-4000 Msun)\nthrough a runaway sequence of mergers. Mass loss from collisions, even for\nvelocity dispersions as high as sigma1D ~ 1000 km/s, does not prevent the\nrunaway. The region of cluster parameter space leading to runaway is even more\nextended than predicted in previous work because, in clusters with sigma1D >\n300 km/s, collisions accelerate (and, in extreme cases, drive) core collapse.\nAlthough the VMS grows rapidly to > 1000 Msun in models exhibiting runaway, we\ncannot predict accurately its final mass. This is because the termination of\nthe runaway process must eventually be determined by a complex interplay\nbetween stellar dynamics, hydrodynamics, and the stellar evolution of the VMS.\n[abridged]",

We build\non this work by showing that they are \"almost always\" componentwise linear,\ni.e. their homogeneous ideals have the property that for any d, the degree d\ncomponent of the ideal generates a new ideal whose minimal free resolution is\nlinear. The one type of exception is clearly spelled out and studied as well.\nThe main technique is a careful study of the way that basic double linkage\nbehaves on tetrahedral curves, and the connection to the tetrahedral curves\nthat are minimal in their even liaison classes. With this preparation, we also\ndescribe the minimal free resolution of a tetrahedral curve, and in particular\nwe show that in any fixed even liaison class there are only finitely many\ntetrahedral curves with linear resolution. Finally, we begin the study of the\ngeneric initial ideal (gin) of a tetrahedral curve. We produce the gin for\narithmetically Cohen-Macaulay tetrahedral curves and for minimal arithmetically\nBuchsbaum tetrahedral curves, and we show how to obtain it for any non-minimal\ntetrahedral curve in terms of the gin of the minimal curve in that even liaison\nclass.",

    "summary": "The Australia Telescope National Facility Mopra millimetre telescope has been\nused to search for 95.1-GHz class I methanol masers towards sixty-two 6.6-GHz\nclass II methanol masers. A total of twenty-six 95.1-GHz masers were detected,\neighteen of these being new discoveries. Combining the results of this search\nwith observations reported in the literature, a near complete sample of\nsixty-six 6.6-GHz class II methanol masers has been searched in the 95.1-GHz\ntransition, with detections towards 38 per cent (twenty-five detections ; not\nall of the sources studied in this paper qualify for the complete sample, and\nsome of the sources in the sample were not observed in the present\nobservations). There is no evidence of an anti-correlation between either the\nvelocity range, or peak flux density of the class I and II transitions,\ncontrary to suggestions from previous studies. The majority of class I methanol\nmaser sources have a velocity range that partially overlaps with the class II\nmaser transitions. The presence of a class I methanol maser associated with a\nclass II maser source is not correlated with the presence (or absence) of\nmain-line OH or water masers. Investigations of the properties of the infrared\nemission associated with the maser sources shows no significant difference\nbetween those class II methanol masers with an associated class I maser and\nthose without. This may be consistent with the hypothesis that the objects\nresponsible for driving class I methanol masers are generally not those that\nproduce main-line OH, water or class II methanol masers.",

The algorithm is described using a\nrepresentation of the system in time-varying controller canonical form. We\nverify that every completely controllable system has such a representation. The\napplication of the nullification algorithm to sampled-data systems is also\nanalysed: we show that a controllable continuous-time time-varying system with\nanalytic coefficients can be nullified utilising zero-hold sampling of the\noutput and time-varying memoryless linear feedback; for generic observables,\nalmost any sampling period can be used.

In the optical and near-IR the\nsource has been very active in the last 3 years, though rather faint most of\nthe time, with noticeable variations of more than a mag in a few days. In\ncontrast, in the radio bands it appears \"quiescent\" since early 2000. The X-ray\nspectra obtained by the three EPIC detectors are well fitted by a power law\nwith extra-absorption at z=0.524. No significant variation of the X-ray flux\noccurred during the pointing. In contrast, contemporaneous dense radio\nmonitoring with the 100 m telescope at Effelsberg shows a ~2-3% flux decrease\nin 6-7 hours, which, if intrinsic, would imply a brightness temperature well\nabove the Compton limit. We construct the broad-band spectral energy\ndistribution of January 18-19, 2004 with simultaneous radio data from\nEffelsberg, optical data from the Nordic Optical Telescope, optical-UV data\nfrom the Optical Monitor onboard XMM-Newton, and X-ray data by the EPIC\ninstruments.

We confirm previous studies, but now\nfor a larger sample, that a large fraction of galaxies show significant\nlopsidedness in their stellar disks, measured as the Fourier amplitude of the\nm=1 component, normalised to the average or m=0 component, in the surface\ndensity. Late-type galaxies are found to be more lopsided, while the presence\nof m=2 spiral arms and bars is correlated. The m=1 amplitude is found to be\nuncorrelated with the tidal forces acting on a galaxy via nearby companions.\nNumerical simulations are carried out to study the generation of m=1 via\ndifferent processes: galaxy tidal encounters, galaxy mergers, and external gas\naccretion and subsequent star formation. The simulations show that galaxy\ninteractions and mergers can trigger strong lopsidedness, but do not explain\nseveral independent statistical properties of observed galaxies. To explain all\nthe observational results, it is required that a large fraction of lopsidedness\nresults from cosmological accretion of gas on galactic disks, which can create\nstrongly lopsided disks when this accretion is asymmetrical enough.",

None of the\ntargets show CO features, either in absorption nor in emission. We derive a\n5sigma upper limit of < 10^-12 cm^-2 to the column density of hot CO (T ~ 1500\nK) in the sources. These upper limits are considerably lower than the values of\nHerbig Ae/Be stars for which warm and hot CO emission has been reported.The\nnon-detection of CO v=1-0 emission in these five targets suggest that Herbig\nAe/Be stars are not a homogeneous group with respect to the structure of the\ngaseous disk and/or the amount of CO in the inner 50 AU of their disks.",

In a future real analysis, the target signal\nwould be a real signal actually observed by a gravitational wave detector such\nas LISA. In this study, however, the target signals are themselves simulations.\nSome cases were selected to resemble sources likely to be detected by LISA when\nit flies; others were selected to facilitate comparison with previous work\nusing Fisher matrix techniques. Then, for each target inspiral signal, a grid\nsearch of the input parameter space is conducted to determine the set of input\nparameters that produce a simulated inspiral output signal compatible with the\ntarget. In this study, we consider four parameters: the two masses, the spin of\nthe larger black hole, and the eccentricity of the orbit. Searching through\nthis four dimensional parameter space requires that hundreds of possible input\nsource parameter combinations be simulated for each target signal analyzed. For\neach input parameter combination, the detailed time history of the phase of the\nresulting inspiral is simulated and compared with the phase history of the\ntarget signal. The simulation, comparison, and grid search technique used in\nthis study requires more work than the Fisher matrix technique used in most\nprevious studies of this topic. However, this method yields a detailed map of\nthe acceptable region of input parameter space, in contrast to the\nmultidimensional ellipsoids of the Fisher matrix method.

The galaxy was imaged using HST/ACS in the Lyman alpha line and\ncontinuum. Using the Starburst99 synthetic spectra and other imaging data from\nHST/WFPC2 we developed a technique that allows us to make the first\nphotometrically valid continuum subtraction for the LYa line. Our results are\nin qualitative agreement with the models of LYa escape being regulated by\nkinematical properties of the interstellar medium. The line-only image shows\nLYa in both emission and absorption. Notably, emission is seen from central\nbright young clusters and is in spatial agreement with the features present in\na longslit spectrum taken with HST/STIS. Diffuse LYa emission regions are seen\nsurrounding the central starburst where photons escape after one or more\nresonant scatterings in HI. These regions dominate the total LYa output.\nPhotometry reveals a total LYa flux of 194 x 10^-14 erg/s/cm^2. Inside an\nartificial aperture matching that of the IUE satelite, we measure a LYa flux\nand equivalent width consistent with previous studies using the IUE. Analysis\nof parameter dependencies show our technique to be largely parameter\nindependent, producing LYa maps indistinguishable from one another by eye and\nwith fluxes consistent with one another to better than 50%. By comparison of\nLYa fluxes with Ha fluxes of a previous study, we estimate that each observed\nLYa photon has undergone ~2 additional scatterings.

The\nexperimental results were compared with the band-structure calculation based on\nLDA + $U$. The band structure of LSMO thin films consists of several highly\ndispersive O 2$p$ derived bands in the binding energy range of 2.0 - 6.0 eV and\nMn 3$d$ derived bands near $E_{F}$. ARPES spectra around the $Gamma$ point show\na dispersive band near $E_{F}$ indicative of an electron pocket centered at the\n$Gamma$ point, although it was not so clearly resolved as an electronlike\npocket due to the suppression of spectral weight in the vicinity of $E_{F}$.\nCompared with the band-structure calculation, the observed conduction band is\nassigned to the Mn 3$de_{g}$ majority-spin band responsible for the\nhalf-metallic nature of LSMO. We have found that the estimated size of the\nFermi surface is consistent with the prediction of the band-structure\ncalculation, while the band width becomes significantly narrower than the\ncalculation. Also, the intensity near $E_{F}$ is strongly reduced. The origin\nof these discrepancies between the experiment and the calculation is discussed.",

The no-flipping theorem, which rules out the existence\nof a universal NOT gate for an arbitrary qubit, emerges as a corollary to this\ntheorem. The `no partial erasure' theorem is shown to apply to spin and bosonic\ncoherent states, with the latter result showing that the `no partial erasure'\ntheorem applies to continuous variable quantum information schemes as well.

In homogeneous systems both variables\ngenerally behave similarly, but this is not at all so in spin glasses.

However, this bound only\napplies to codes which recover the message exactly. Naively, one might expect\nthat correcting errors to very high fidelity would only allow small violations\nof this bound. This intuition is incorrect: in this paper we describe quantum\nerror-correcting codes capable of correcting up to (n-1)/2 arbitrary errors\nwith fidelity exponentially close to 1, at the price of increasing the size of\nthe registers (i.e., the coding alphabet). This demonstrates a sharp\ndistinction between exact and approximate quantum error correction. The codes\nhave the property that any $t$ components reveal no information about the\nmessage, and so they can also be viewed as error-tolerant secret sharing\nschemes.\n  The construction has several interesting implications for cryptography and\nquantum information theory. First, it suggests that secret sharing is a better\nclassical analogue to quantum error correction than is classical error\ncorrection. Second, it highlights an error in a purported proof that verifiable\nquantum secret sharing (VQSS) is impossible when the number of cheaters t is\nn/4. More generally, the construction illustrates a difference between exact\nand approximate requirements in quantum cryptography and (yet again) the\ndelicacy of security proofs and impossibility results in the quantum model.",

    "summary": "A jet is simulated on the background of a galactic wind headed by a radiative\nbow shock. The wind shell, which is due to the radiative bow shock, is\neffectively destroyed by the impact of the jet cocoon, thanks to\nRayleigh-Taylor instabilities. Associated strong HI absorption, and possibly\nalso molecular emission, in high redshift radio galaxies which is observed\npreferentially in the smaller ones may be explained by that model, which is an\nimprovement of an earlier radiative bow shock model. The model requires\ntemperatures of $\\approx 10^6$ K in the proto-clusters hosting these objects,\nand may be tested by high resolution spectroscopy of the Ly$\\alpha$ line. The\nsimulations show that -- before destruction -- the jet cocoon fills the wind\nshell entirely for a considerable time with intact absorption system.\nTherefore, radio imaging of sources smaller than the critical size should\nreveal the round central bubbles, if the model is correct.",

Aiming to push unquenched simulations with the Wilson action\ntowards the computationally expensive regime of small quark masses we address\nthe question whether one can possibly save computing time by extrapolating\nresults from small lattices to the infinite volume, prior to the usual chiral\nand continuum extrapolations. In the present work the systematic volume\ndependence of simulated pion and nucleon masses is investigated and compared\nwith a long-standing analytic formula by Luescher and with results from Chiral\nPerturbation Theory. We analyze data from Hybrid Monte Carlo simulations with\nthe standard (unimproved) two-flavor Wilson action at two different lattice\nspacings of a=0.08fm and 0.13fm. The quark masses considered correspond to\napproximately 85 and 50% (at the smaller a) and 36% (at the larger a) of the\nstrange quark mass. At each quark mass we study at least three different\nlattices with L/a=10 to 24 sites in the spatial directions (L=0.85-2.08fm).",

We present results from\nan Eulerian adaptive mesh refinement simulation demonstrating the formation of\na primordial star within a region ionized by an earlier nearby star. Despite\nthe higher temperatures of the ionized gas and its flow out of the dark matter\npotential wells, this second star formed within 23 million years of its\nneighbor's death. The enhanced electron fraction within the HII region\ncatalyzes rapid molecular hydrogen formation that leads to faster cooling in\nthe subsequent star forming halos than in the first halos. This \"second\ngeneration\" primordial protostar has a much lower accretion rate because,\nunlike the first protostar, it forms in a rotationally supported disk of\napprox. 10-100 solar masses. This is primarily due to the much higher angular\nmomentum of the halo in which the second star forms. In contrast to previously\npublished scenarios, such configurations may allow binaries or multiple systems\nof lower mass stars to form. These first high resolution calculations offer\ninsight into the impact of feedback upon subsequent populations of stars and\nclearly demonstrate how primordial chemistry promotes the formation of\nsubsequent generations of stars even in the presence of the entropy injected by\nthe first stars into the IGM.",

    "summary": "We investigate Lambda(1520,3/2^-,D_03) photoproduction via the gamma N -> K\nLambda^* reaction process. Using effective Lagrangians, we compute the total\nand differential cross sections as well as the dependence on the momentum\ntransfer for the photoproduction at the tree-level. We employ two different\nform factors: The four-dimensional gauge-invariant type and the three\ndimensional one depending on the external momenta. We find that the total cross\nsections for the proton target are well reproduced as compared with the\nexperimental data. It turns out that the total cross sections for the neutron\ntarget are significantly smaller than those for the proton target. We also\ncompare the present results with the gamma N -> bar{K} Theta^+ reaction in\norder to extract information of Theta^+. Finally the role of K^*--exchange in\nthe production reaction is discussed.",

    "summary": "(Abridged) Motch (1985) suggested that in the hard state of GX 339-4 the soft\nX-ray power-law extrapolated backward in energy agrees with the IR flux. Corbel\n& Fender (2002) showed that the hard state radio power-law extrapolated forward\nin energy meets the extrapolated X-ray power-law at an IR break, which was\nexplicitly observed twice in GX 339-4. This `IR coincidence' has been cited as\nfurther evidence that a jet might make a significant contribution to the X-rays\nin hard state systems. We explore this hypothesis with a series of simultaneous\nradio/X-ray observations of GX 339-4, taken during its 1997, 1999, and 2002\nhard states. We fit these spectra, in detector space, with a simple, but\nremarkably successful, doubly broken power-law that requires an IR spectral\nbreak. For these observations, the break position and the integrated radio/IR\nflux have stronger dependences upon the X-rays than the simplest jet\npredictions. If one allows for a softening of the X-ray power law with\nincreasing flux, then the jet model agrees with the correlation. We also find\nevidence that the radio/X-ray fcorrelation previously observed in GX 339-4\nshows a `parallel track' for the 2002 hard state. The slope of the 2002\ncorrelation is consistent with prior observations; however, the radio amplitude\nis reduced. We then examine the correlation in Cyg X-1 through the use of radio\ndata, obtained with the Ryle radio telescope, and RXTE data, from the ASM and\npointed observations. We again find evidence of `parallel tracks', and here\nthey are associated with `failed transitions' to the soft state. We also find\nthat for Cyg X-1 the radio flux is more fundamentally correlated with the hard\nX-ray flux.",

In particular these are models\nwhich can be tailored to exhibit correlated jumps in both the log price of\nassets and the instantaneous volatility. Naturally similar to a recent work of\nBarndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (2001a, b), such models may be used in a\nlikelihood based framework. These likelihoods are based on the unobserved\nintegrated volatility, rather than the instantaneous volatility. James (2005)\nestablishes general results for the likelihood and estimation of a large class\nof such models which include possible leverage effects. In this note we show\nthat exact expressions for likelihood models based on generalizations of Carr\nand Wu (2005) and Huang and Wu (2005), follow essentially from the arguments in\nTheorem 5.1 in James (2005) with some slight modification.

In\nthis view it is more relevant to find ways to deduce the microscopic\ningredients of spacetime and matter from their macroscopic attributes than to\nfind ways to quantize general relativity because it would only give us the\nequivalent of phonon physics, not the equivalents of atoms or quantum\nelectrodyanmics. It may turn out that spacetime is merely a representation of\ncollective state of matter in some limiting regime of interactions, which is\nthe view expressed by Sakharov. In this talk, working within the conceptual\nframework of geometro-hydrodynamics, we suggest a new way to look at the nature\nof spacetime inspired by Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) physics. We ask the\nquestion whether spacetime could be a condensate, even without the knowledge of\nwhat the `atom of spacetime' is. We begin with a summary of the main themes for\nthis new interpretation of cosmology and spacetime physics, and the `bottom-up'\napproach to quantum gravity. We then describe the `Bosenova' experiment of\ncontrolled collapse of a BEC and our cosmology-inspired interpretation of its\nresults. We discuss the meaning of a condensate in different context. We\nexplore how far this idea can sustain, its advantages and pitfalls, and its\nimplications on the basic tenets of physics and existing programs of quantum\ngravity.",

    "summary": "We report measurements of the c-axis angular-dependent magnetoresistance\n(AMR) for a Na$_{0.48}$CoO$_{2}$ single crystal, with a magnetic field of 10 T\nrotating within Co-O planes. Below the metal-insulator transition temperature\ninduced by the charge ordering, the oscillation of the AMR is dominated by a\ntwo-fold rotational symmetry. The amplitudes of the oscillation corresponding\nto the four- and six-fold rotational symmetries are distinctive in low\ntemperatures, but they merge into the background simultaneously at about 25 K.\nThe six-fold oscillation originates naturally from the lattice symmetry. The\nobservation of the four-fold rotational symmetry is consistent with the picture\nproposed by Choy, et al., that the Co lattice in the charge ordered state will\nsplit into two orthorhombic sublattice with one occupied by Co$^{3+}$ ions and\nthe other by Co$^{4+}$ ions. We have also measured the c-axis AMR for\nNa$_{0.35}$CoO$_{2}$ and Na$_{0.85}$CoO$_{2}$ single crystals, and found no\nevidence for the existence of two- and four-fold symmetries.",

In de Wit et al. (2004) we presented deep K-band\nimaging of 5 arcmin fields centred on 43 massive O-type field stars that\nrevealed that the large majority of these objects are single objects. In this\ncontribution we explore the possibility that the field O stars are dynamically\nejected from young clusters, by investigating their peculiar space velocity\ndistribution, their distance from the Galactic plane, and their spatial\nvicinity to known young stellar clusters. We (re-)identify 22 field O-type\nstars as candidate runaway OB-stars. The statistics show that ~4% of all O-type\nstars with V < 8 can be considered as formed outside a cluster environment.\nMost are spectroscopically single objects, some are visual binaries. The\nderived percentage for O-type stars that form isolated in the field based on\nour statistical analyses is in agreement with what is expected from\ncalculations adopting a universal cluster richness distribution with power\nindex of beta = 1.7, assuming that the cluster richness distribution is\ncontinuous down to the smallest clusters containing one single star.",

This suggests that the ansatz for the spectral function in the\npresent sum rule approximates the physical spectrum better than the usual\nlowest pole plus continuum ansatz.

We use a simple\nanalytical approximation to show that rapid core collapse can occur in two\nphysical regimes. For cluster masses ~ 10^6 M_sun, an IMBH may be formed if the\ncollapse timescale is <~ 3 Myr, as already well known; the parent cluster is\nexpected to survive. For cluster masses ~ 10^5 M_sun, an IMBH may result from a\ncore collapse on even shorter timescales (~ 0.5 Myr), when the protocluster is\nstill embedded in optically thick gas. Most clusters in this latter regime are\ndisrupted ``explosively'' as soon as the gas is ionized by the OB stars.

I consider non-renormalizable\ntheories whose renormalizable subsector R is interacting and does not contain\nrelevant parameters. The \"infinite\" reduction is determined by i) perturbative\nmeromorphy around the free-field limit of R, or ii) analyticity around the\ninteracting fixed point of R. In general, prescriptions i) and ii) mutually\nexclude each other. When the reduction is formulated using i), the number of\nindependent couplings remains finite or slowly grows together with the order of\nthe expansion. The growth is slow in the sense that a reasonably small set of\nparameters is sufficient to make predictions up to very high orders. Instead,\nin case ii) the number of couplings generically remains finite.

Using the recently established property of selfduality of the\nevolution operator (hep-ph/0502119), we show how to properly define the target\ngluon and dipole creation operators in terms of dual Wilson lines (dual eikonal\nfactors). We explain how to expand these operators in terms of the functional\nderivatives of the color charge density, in the situation when they act on the\neikonal factors of the projectile partons. We explicitly calculate the\nexpansion of the high energy evolution operator to fourth order in the\nfunctional derivatives.

    "summary": "The origins of AC losses in the high Tc superconductors are not addressed\nadequately in literature. We found out, frequent Josephson Junction (JJ)\ndecoupling (both intergranular and the interlayer) due to the flow of AC\ncurrent is one of the main origins of the AC losses in high Tc superconductors.\nWe have determined the AC losses in superconductors in the rf range by\nmeasuring the absolute value of non-resonant rf power absorbed by the samples.\nOur data shows that under certain conditions when both the number density of\nJJs present in the sample and the JJ critical current cross a threshold value,\nAC losses in the superconducting state keeps on increasing with decreasing\ntemperature below Tc. The underlying mechanism is an interesting interplay of\nJJ coupling energy and the amplitude of rf voltage applied to the sample. The\neffect of an applied magnetic field, variation of rf frequency and temperature\nwere studied in detail. To find out the exact relation between the JJ coupling\nenergy, JJ number density, applied AC frequency, the amplitude of AC current\nand the AC losses in superconductors, we have studied samples of different\ncrystalline properties, different grain sizes, pressurized with different\npressure and sintered at different physical and chemical situations. The\nimplementations of these results are discussed. These results have important\nimplications for the understanding of the origin of AC losses and\ncharacterization of superconducting samples. In this paper we also extend the\ncapability of the AC losses studies in superconductors for the characterization\nof materials for device applications.",

The twins can\nperform \"global\" experiments to determine their velocities with respect to the\npreferred reference frame (by sending light signals around the cylinder, for\ninstance). Here we discuss the possibility of doing so with local experiments.\nSince one spatial dimension is compact, the electrostatic field of a point\ncharge deviates from $1/r^2$. We show that although the functional form of the\nforce law is the same for all inertial observers, as required by local Lorentz\ninvariance, the deviation from 1/r2 is observer-dependent.

They are assumed to be associated with star-quakes of\npulsars accelerating electrons and, possibly, protons to high energy in the\nhuge magnetic fields as inferred from the observations. Because of this and the\nobservation of non-thermal emission it has been speculated that they may be\ncosmic ray accelerators producing gamma-rays up to TeV energies. Neutrino\ntelescopes, such as AMANDA and the ANTARES now under construction, could be\nused as TeV-gamma detectors for very short emissions by measuring underground\nmuons produced in $\\gamma$ showers. We estimate signal and background rates for\nTeV photons from SGR giant flares in AMANDA, and we provide an estimate of the\ngamma shower events that Milagro could detect.\n  Moreover, we consider that, if hadrons are accelerated in these sources, high\nenergy neutrinos would be produced together with photons. These may be detected\nin neutrino telescopes using neutrino-induced cascades and upgoing muons.\n  We argue that the Antarctic Muon and Neutrino Detector Array AMANDA may have\nobserved the December 27, 2004 giant flare from the soft gamma-ray repeater SGR\n1806-20 if the non-thermal component of the spectrum extends to TeV energies\n(at present the actual data is subject to blind analysis).

    "summary": "Results of simultaneous INTEGRAL and optical observations of galactic\nmicroquasar SS433 in May 2003 and INTEGRAL/RXTE observations in March 2004 are\npresented. Persistent precessional variability with a maximum to minimum\nuneclipsed hard X-ray flux ratio of \\sim 4 is discovered. The 18-60 keV X-ray\neclipse is found to be in phase with optical and near infrared eclipses. The\norbital eclipse observed by INTEGRAL in May 2003 is at least two times deeper\nand apparently wider than in soft X-ray band. The broadband X-ray spectrum\n2-100 keV simultaneously detected by RXTE/INTEGRAL in March 2004 can be\ndescribed by bremsstrahlung emission from optically thin thermal plasma with\nkT\\sim 30 keV. The optical spectroscopy with the 6-m SAO BTA telescope\nconfirmed the optical companion to be an A5-A7 supergiant. For the first time,\nspectorscopic indications of a strong heating effect in the optical star\natmosphere are found. The measurements of absorption lines which are presumably\nformed in the non-illuminated side of the supergiant yield its radial velocity\nsemi-amplitude K_v=132\\pm 9 km/s. The analysis of the observed hard X-ray light\ncurve and the eclipse duration, combined with spectroscopically found optical\nstar radial velocity corrected for the strong heating effect, allows us to\nmodel SS433 as a massive X-ray binary. Assuming that the hard X-ray source in\nSS433 is eclipsed by the donor star that exactly fills its Roche lobe, the\nmasses of the optical and compact components in SS433 are suggested to be\nM_v\\approx 30 M_\\odot and M_x\\approx 9M_\\odot, respectively. This provides\nfurther evidence that SS433 is a massive binary system with supercritical\naccretion onto a black hole.",

We discuss\ntypical features of observed GRBs within our model and explain how quark stars\nin the CFL phase might constitute natural candidates for corresponding inner\nengines.",

    "summary": "The energy composition of the Universe, as emerged from the Type Ia supernova\nobservations and the WMAP data, looks preposterously complex, -- but only at\nthe first glance. In fact, its structure proves to be simple and regular. An\nanalysis in terms of the Friedmann integral enables to recognize a remarkably\nsimple time-independent covariant robust recipe of the cosmic mix: the\nnumerical values of the Friedmann integral for vacuum, dark matter, baryons and\nradiation are approximately identical. The identity may be treated as a\nsymmetry relation that unifies cosmic energies into a regular set, a quartet,\nwith the Friedmann integral as its common genuine time-independent physical\nparameter. Such cosmic internal (non-geometrical) symmetry exists whenever\ncosmic energies themselves exist in nature. It is most natural for a finite\nUniverse suggested by the WMAP data. A link to fundamental theory may be found\nunder the assumption about a special significance of the electroweak energy\nscale in both particle physics and cosmology. A freeze-out model developed on\nthis basis demonstrates that the physical nature of new symmetry might be due\nto the interplay between electroweak physics and gravity at the cosmic age of a\nfew picoseconds. The big `hierarchy number' of particle physics represents the\ninterplay in the model. This number quantifies the Friedmann integral and gives\nalso a measure to some other basic cosmological figures and phenomena\nassociated with new symmetry. In this way, cosmic internal symmetry provides a\ncommon ground for better understanding of old and recent problems that\notherwise seem unrelated; the coincidence of the observed cosmic densities, the\nflatness of the co-moving space, the initial perturbations and their amplitude,\nthe cosmic entropy are among them.",

Since the process of void formation is non-linear, a fully\nrelativistic model, which simulates the evolution of voids from the moment of\nthe last scattering until the present instant, is presented. It is found that\nin order to obtain a model of a void which evolves from $\\delta_0 = - 10^{-5}$\nat the last scattering moment to the present day $\\delta = - 0.94$, the\nexistence of radiation must be taken into account. The ratio of radiation\nenergy density to matter energy density in CDM models at the moment of last\nscattering is 1/5. This paper proves that such a value of radiation energy\ndensity cannot be neglected and influences the first stages of void evolution.\nNamely, it is important to the process of structure formation and hence\nsignificantly influences the dynamics of the Universe in the first millions of\nyears after the last scattering.\n  From the fact that the evolution of voids proceeds differently in various\ncosmological background models we use the process of void formation to put some\nlimits on values of cosmological parameters. We find that the model with\n$\\Omega_{mat} \\approx 0.3$ fits the observational data best.",

The corresponding bound on the string mass per unit\nlength, within our string model, is $G\\mu < 1.8 (2.7) \\times 10^{-7}$ at 68\n(95)% c.l., where this constraint has been altered from what appears below\nfollowing the correction of errors in our cosmic string code outlined in a\nrecent erratum, astro-ph/0604141. We also calculate the B-type polarization\nspectra sourced by cosmic strings and discuss the prospects of their detection.",

From ground based optical and near-infrared imaging, we measured the\nzero-point and scatter in the color--magnitude relation of the early-type\npopulations, which when combined with Stanford et al. (1998), yields a sample\nof cluster early--type galaxies that span a lookback time of 9 gigayears from\nthe present. We see the colors of the early--type cluster members become bluer\nwith increasing redshift. We fit a set of models to the change in the color as\na function of redshift with the best fitting values ranging from a formation\nredshift of 3^+2_-1 to 5_-3. The large scatter in resulting formation epochs,\nwhich depends on the details of the models used, implies that we can conclude\nthat the oldest stars in the elliptical galaxies appear to have formed at\nredshifts of z>3. We find possible evolution in the scatter of the colors, with\nsome high redshift clusters showing scatter as small as the Coma cluster but\nothers showing much larger scatter. Those clusters with a small scatter imply\neither a formation redshift of at least z ~ 3 or a smaller spread in the range\nof formation redshifts at lower redshifts, assuming a Gaussian distribution of\nstar-formation around the mean epoch.",

For stock market trading activity (traded value), good scaling\nover 5 orders of magnitude with the exponent alpha = 0.72 was observed.

Herein we develop this\ntechnique for integer-spin systems which generically exhibit a simple\nparamagnetic phase as well as magnetically-ordered phases with coplanar and\ncollinear spin order. Within the fermionized-vortex approach, we derive a\nlow-energy effective theory containing Dirac fermions with two flavors\nminimally coupled to a U(1) and a Chern-Simons gauge field. At criticality we\nargue that the Chern-Simons gauge field can be subsumed into the U(1) gauge\nfield, and up to irrelevant interactions one arrives at quantum electrodynamics\nin (2+1) dimensions (QED3). Moreover, we conjecture that critical QED3 with\nfull SU(2) flavor symmetry describes the O(4) multicritical point of the spin\nmodel where the paramagnet and two magnetically-ordered phases merge. The\nremarkable implication is that QED3 with flavor SU(2) symmetry is dual to\nordinary critical Phi^4 field theory with O(4) symmetry. This leads to a number\nof unexpected, verifiable predictions for QED3. A connection of our\nfermionized-vortex approach with the dipole interpretation of the nu=1/2\nfractional quantum Hall state is also demonstrated.

To help resolve these\nissues, we describe a new, merger-driven scenario for the cosmological\nformation of disk galaxies at high redshifts that supplements the standard\nmodel based on dissipational collapse.In this picture, large gaseous disks may\nbe produced from high-angular momentum mergers of systems that are\ngas-dominated, i.e. M_gas/(M_gas +M_star > 0.5 at the height of the merger.\nPressurization from the multiphase structure of the interstellar medium\nprevents the complete conversion of gas into stars during the merger, and if\nenough gas remains to form a disk, the remnant eventually resembles a disk\ngalaxy. We perform numerical simulations of galaxy mergers to study how\nsupernovae feedback strength, supermassive black hole growth and feedback,\nprogenitor gas fraction, merger mass-ratio, and orbital geometry impact the\nformation of remnant disks. We find that disks can build angular momentum\nthrough mergers and the degree of rotational support of the baryons in the\nmerger remnant is primarily related to feedback processes associated with star\nformation. Disk-dominated remnants are restricted to form in mergers that are\ngas-dominated at the time of final coalescence and gas-dominated mergers\ntypically require extreme progenitor gas fractions (>80%). We also show that\nthe formation of rotationally-supported stellar systems in mergers is not\nrestricted to idealized orbits, or major or minor mergers. We suggest that the\nhierarchical nature of the LCDM cosmology and the physics of the interstellar\ngas may act together to form spiral galaxies by building the angular momentum\nof disks through early, gas-dominated mergers.",

We discovered the counter-rotating core via single-slit Keck/ESI\nechelle spectroscopy; subsequent integral field spectroscopy was obtained with\nthe Gemini/GMOS IFU. The counter-rotating region has a peak rotation velocity\nof 21 km/s as compared to the main galaxy's rotation speed of greater than 45\nkm/s in the opposite direction. The counter-rotating region extends to a radius\nof 4'' (0.6 kpc), slightly smaller than the half-light radius of the galaxy\nwhich is 5.3'' (0.8 kpc) and is confined to a disk whose scale height is less\nthan 0.8'' (0.1 kpc). We compute an age and metallicity of the inner\ncounter-rotating region of 3 +/- 0.5 Gyr and [Fe/H] = 0.2 +/- 0.2 dex, based on\nLick absorption-line indices. The lack of other large galaxies in this region\nlimits possible scenarios for the formation of the counter-rotating core. We\ndiscuss several scenarios and favor one in which NGC 770 accreted a small\ngas-rich dwarf galaxy during a very minor merging event.

The astrospheric absorption is of particular\ninterest because it can be used to study solar-like stellar winds that are\notherwise undetectable. We find and analyze 33 HST Lyman-alpha spectra in the\narchive. All the spectra were taken with the E140M grating of the Space\nTelescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) instrument on board HST. The HST/STIS\nspectra yield 4 new detections of heliospheric absorption (70 Oph, Xi Boo, 61\nVir, and HD 165185) and 7 new detections of astrospheric absorption (EV Lac, 70\nOph, Xi Boo, 61 Vir, Delta Eri, HD 128987, and DK UMa), doubling the previous\nnumber of heliospheric and astrospheric detections. When combined with previous\nresults, 10 of 17 lines of sight within 10 pc yield detections of astrospheric\nabsorption. This high detection fraction implies that most of the ISM within 10\npc must be at least partially neutral, since the presence of H I within the ISM\nsurrounding the observed star is necessary for an astrospheric detection. In\ncontrast, the detection percentage is only 9.7% (3 out of 31) for stars beyond\n10 pc. Our Lyman-alpha analyses provide measurements of ISM H I and D I column\ndensities for all 33 lines of sight, and we discuss some implications of these\nresults. Finally, we measure chromospheric Lyman-alpha fluxes from the observed\nstars. We use these fluxes to determine how Lyman-alpha flux correlates with\ncoronal X-ray and chromospheric Mg II emission, and we also study how\nLyman-alpha emission depends on stellar rotation.",

We know that wavelet-kurtosis outperforms other\nmethods such as the bispectrum, the genus, ridgelet-kurtosis and\ncurvelet-kurtosis on an empirical basis, but relatively few studies have\ncompared other transform-based statistics, such as extreme values, or more\nrecent tools such as Higher Criticism (HC), or proposed `best possible' choices\nfor such statistics.\n  In this paper we consider two models for transform-domain coefficients: (a) a\npower-law model, which seems suited to the wavelet coefficients of simulated\ncosmic strings; and (b) a sparse mixture model, which seems suitable for the\ncurvelet coefficients of filamentary structure. For model (a), if power-law\nbehavior holds with finite 8-th moment, excess kurtosis is an asymptotically\noptimal detector, but if the 8-th moment is not finite, a test based on extreme\nvalues is asymptotically optimal. For model (b), if the transform coefficients\nare very sparse, a recent test, Higher Criticism, is an optimal detector, but\nif they are dense, kurtosis is an optimal detector. Empirical wavelet\ncoefficients of simulated cosmic strings have power-law character, infinite\n8-th moment, while curvelet coefficients of the simulated cosmic strings are\nnot very sparse. In all cases, excess kurtosis seems to be an effective test in\nmoderate-resolution imagery.",

Working with such\noperads, we characterize coherent unit actions in terms of linear equations of\nthe generators of the operads. We then use these equations to give all possible\noperad relations that allow such coherent unit actions. We further show that\ncoherent unit actions are preserved under taking products and thus yield Hopf\nalgebras on the free object of the product operads when the factor operads have\ncoherent unit actions.

The WMAP estimator is based\non the implicit assumption that the CMB bispectrum, the harmonic transform of\nthe three-point correlation function, contains all of the primordial\nnon-Gaussianity information in a CMB map. We first demonstrate that the\nSignal-to-Noise (S/N) of an estimator based on CMB three-point correlation\nfunctions is significantly larger than the S/N of any estimator based on\nhigher-order correlation functions; justifying our choice to focus on the\nthree-point correlation function. We then conclude that the estimator based on\nthe three-point correlation function, which was used by WMAP, is optimal,\nmeaning it saturates the Cramer-Rao Inequality when the underlying CMB map is\nnearly Gaussian. We quantify this restriction by demonstrating that the\nsuboptimal character of our estimator is proportonal to the square of the\nfiducial non-Gaussianity, which is already constrained to be extremely small,\nso we can consider the WMAP estimator to be optimal in practice. Our\nconclusions do not depend on the form of the primordial bispectrum, only on the\nobservationally established weak levels of primordial non-Gaussianity.",

The aim is to identify a spectral theory for a class of\nsystems based on iterations of a non-invertible endomorphism.\n  We are motivated by the more familiar approach to wavelet theory which starts\nwith the two-to-one endomorphism $r: z \\mapsto z^2$ in the one-torus $\\bt$, a\nwavelet filter, and an associated transfer operator. This leads to a scaling\nfunction and a corresponding closed subspace $V_0$ in the Hilbert space\n$L^2(\\br)$. Using the dyadic scaling on the line $\\br$, one has a nested family\nof closed subspaces $V_n$, $n \\in \\bz$, with trivial intersection, and with\ndense union in $L^2(\\br)$. More generally, we achieve the same outcome, but in\ndifferent Hilbert spaces, for a class of non-linear problems. In fact, we see\nthat the geometry of scales of subspaces in Hilbert space is ubiquitous in the\nanalysis of multiscale problems, e.g., martingales, complex iteration dynamical\nsystems, graph-iterated function systems of affine type, and subshifts in\nsymbolic dynamics. We develop a general framework for these examples which\nstarts with a fixed endomorphism $r$ (i.e., generalizing $r(z) = z^2$) in a\ncompact metric space $X$.

Therefore a brane geometry admitting a one-parameter group of\nconformal motions may provide an explanation for the dynamics of the neutral\nhydrogen clouds at large distances from the galactic center, which is usually\nexplained by postulating the existence of the dark matter.",

The most\nfavorable signals of SUSY are stau pair production and neutralino pair\nproduction where the small mass difference between the lighter stau and the\nlightest neutralino in the co-annihilation region is ~5-15 GeV and hence\ngenerates low-energy tau leptons in the final state. This small mass difference\nwould be a striking signal of many SUGRA models. We find that a calorimeter\ncovering down to 1^o from the beams is crucial to reduce the two-photon\nbackground and the mass difference could be measured at a level of 10% with 500\nfb^-1 of data where an invariant mass of two-tau jets and missing energy is\nused as a discriminator.",

Companionship is inferred from the absence of a 3\"6\noffset source in 2MASS or photographic plate images, implying that the observed\nsecondary component is a co-moving late-type dwarf. With a projected separation\nof 11 AU and nearly equal-magnitude components, Gliese 337CD has properties\nsimilar to other known companion and field substellar binaries. Its long\norbital period (estimated to be ~140-180 yr) inhibits short-term astrometric\nmass measurements, but the Gliese 337CD system is ideal for studying the L/T\ntransition at a fixed age and metallicity. From a compilation of all known\nwidely separated (>~100 AU) stellar/brown dwarf multiple systems, we find\nevidence that the binary fraction of brown dwarfs in these systems is notably\nhigher than that of field brown dwarfs, 45(+15)(-13)% versus 18(+7)(-4)% for\nanalogous samples.

One obstacle that limits the\npractical usage of frequent pattern mining is the extremely large number of\npatterns generated. Such a large size of the output collection makes it\ndifficult for users to understand and use in practice. Even restricting the\noutput to the border of the frequent itemset collection does not help much in\nalleviating the problem. In this paper we address the issue of overwhelmingly\nlarge output size by introducing and studying the following problem: mining\ntop-k approximate frequent patterns. The union of the power sets of these k\nsets should satisfy the following conditions: (1) including itemsets with\nlarger support as many as possible and (2) including itemsets with smaller\nsupport as less as possible. An integrated objective function is designed to\ncombine these two objectives. Consequently, we derive the upper bounds on\nobjective function and present an approximate branch-and-bound method for\nfinding the feasible solution.

    "summary": "We present the first X-ray observation of an oscillation during a stellar\nflare. The flare occurred on the active M-type dwarf AT Mic and was observed\nwith XMM-Newton. The soft X-ray light curve (0.2-12 keV) is investigated with\nwavelet analysis. The flare's extended, flat peak shows clear evidence for a\ndamped oscillation with a period of around 750 s, an exponential damping time\nof around 2000 s, and an initial, relative peak-to-peak amplitude of around\n15%. We suggest that the oscillation is a standing magneto-acoustic wave tied\nto the flare loop, and find that the most likely interpretation is a\nlongitudinal, slow-mode wave, with a resulting loop length of (2.5 +- 0.2) e10\ncm. The local magnetic field strength is found to be (105 +- 50) G. These\nvalues are consistent with (oscillation-independent) flare cooling time models\nand pressure balance scaling laws. Such a flare oscillation provides an\nexcellent opportunity to obtain coronal properties like the size of a flare\nloop or the local magnetic field strength for the otherwise\nspatially-unresolved star.",

    "summary": "Dark matter direct and indirect detection signals depend crucially on the\ndark matter distribution. While the formation of large scale structure is\nindependent of the nature of the cold dark matter (CDM), the fate of\ninhomogeneities on sub-galactic scales, and hence the present day CDM\ndistribution on these scales, depends on the micro-physics of the CDM\nparticles. We study the density contrast of Weakly Interacting Massive\nParticles (WIMPs) on sub-galactic scales. We calculate the damping of the\nprimordial power spectrum due to collisional damping and free-streaming of\nWIMPy CDM and show that free-streaming leads to a CDM power spectrum with a\nsharp cut-off at about $10^{-6} M_\\odot$. We also calculate the transfer\nfunction for the growth of the inhomogeneities in the linear regime, taking\ninto account the suppression in the growth of the CDM density contrast after\nmatter-radiation equality due to baryons and show that our analytic results are\nin good agreement with numerical calculations. Combining the transfer function\nwith the damping of the primordial fluctuations we produce a WMAP normalized\nprimordial CDM power spectrum, which can serve as an input for high resolution\nCDM simulations. We find that the smallest inhomogeneities typically have\nco-moving radius of about 1 pc and enter the non-linear regime at a redshift of\n$60 \\pm 20$. We study the effect of scale dependence of the primordial power\nspectrum on these numbers and also use the spherical collapse model to make\nsimple estimates of the properties of the first generation of WIMP halos to\nform. We find that the very first WIMPy halos may have a significant impact on\nindirect dark matter searches.",

In every case, the warp signature has\nbeen detected. An identical analysis of the DIRBE/COBE data in all its ten\nbands covering the entire infrared spectrum (1.25-240 micron), also leads to\ndetection of warp signatures with very similar phase as found from the MSX\ndata.

    "summary": "Using cosmological N-body simulations we study the radial velocity\ndistribution in dark matter haloes focusing on the lowest-order even moments,\ndispersion and kurtosis. We determine the properties of ten massive haloes in\nthe simulation box approximating their density distribution by the NFW formula\ncharacterized by the virial mass and concentration. We also calculate the\nvelocity anisotropy parameter of the haloes and find it mildly radial and\nincreasing with distance from the halo centre. The radial velocity dispersion\nof the haloes shows a characteristic profile with a maximum, while the radial\nkurtosis profile decreases with distance starting from a value close to\nGaussian near the centre. We therefore confirm that dark matter haloes possess\nintrinsically non-Gaussian, flat-topped velocity distributions. We find that\nthe radial velocity moments of the simulated haloes are quite well reproduced\nby the solutions of the Jeans equations obtained for the halo parameters with\nthe anisotropy measured in the simulations. We also study the radial velocity\nmoments for a composite cluster made of ten haloes out to ten virial radii. In\nthis region the velocity dispersion decreases systematically to reach the value\nof the background, while kurtosis increases from below to above the Gaussian\nvalue of 3 signifying a transition from a flat-topped to a strongly peaked\nvelocity distribution with respect to the Gaussian, which can be interpreted as\nthe dominance of ordered flow with a small dispersion. We illustrate the\ntransition by showing explicitly the velocity distribution of the composite\ncluster in a few radial bins.",

The associated\nfirst-order system, a quasi-periodic skew-product, is shown to be reducible for\nalmost all values of the energy. This is a partial nonperturbative\ngeneralization of a reducibility theorem by Eliasson. We also extend\nnonperturbatively the genericity of Cantor spectrum for these Schr\\\"odinger\noperators.

In July 2004 the source had a 2-10 keV flux of 6.2$\\times10^{-12}$ erg\ncm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and a pulsed fraction P$_F$=0.68. The comparison of the\nthree data sets shows the presence of an anti-correlation between flux and\npulsed fraction, implying that previous estimates of the source energetics\nbased on the assumption of a large and constant pulsed fraction might be\nsignificantly underestimated. The source spectrum is well described by a power\nlaw plus blackbody model (kT~0.63 keV, photon index $\\Gamma$~2.7-3.5) or,\nalternatively, by the sum of two blackbodies of which the hotter is Comptonized\nby relativistic electrons. In this case the temperatures are kT${_1}$~0.2-0.3\nkeV and kT${_2}$~0.4-0.5 keV and the emitting area of the cooler component is\nconsistent with the whole neutron star surface. The long term luminosity\nvariation of a factor >~2 is accompanied by relatively small variations in the\nspectral shape. Phase resolved spectroscopy indicates a harder spectrum in\ncorrespondence of the pulse maximum. No spectral features have been detected\nwith 4$\\sigma$ limits on the equivalent width in the range ~10-220 eV,\ndepending on line energy and width.",

    "summary": "The synchrotron emission observed from many astrophysical objects is commonly\nmodelled to arise from relativistic electrons in an emission region occupied by\na spatially homogeneous, but tangled magnetic field. However, we know that\nmagnetic fields embedded in ionised gases tend to form flux ropes interspersed\nwith regions of much lower magnetic field strengths. Here we develop a full\ndescription of the evolution of the energy distribution of relativistic\nelectrons in a plasma divided into two distinct regions with different\nstrengths of the magnetic field. Electrons are able to continuously leak from\nthe low-field region into the high-field region. The model becomes fully\nanalytic for physically reasonable assumptions. We show that such a leaky box\nmodel produces two distinct breaks in the electron energy distributions which\ngive rise to three breaks in the resulting synchrotron spectrum. The spectral\nslopes in between the breaks are in general not constant and thus allow for\nsignificant curvature of the spectrum. These spectra are consistent with\nspatially resolved observations of the radio spectra of the lobes of radio\ngalaxies. The exact form of the spectra depends on the adopted diffusion rate.\nThe leaky box model significantly extends the time over which synchrotron\nemission can be detected at a given frequency compared to the usually assumed\ncase of homogeneous magnetic fields. The spectral ages inferred for the\nelectron population from standard techniques for the leaky box model are\nconsiderably younger than their real age.",

A new multicomponent formalism is developed\nto describe three-body systems with nonstatic pairwise interactions and\nnon-nucleonic degrees of freedom. Precise variational calculations of $3N$\nbound states are carried out in the dressed-bag model including the new scalar\nthree-body force. The unified coupling constants and form factors for $2N$ and\n$3N$ force operators are used in the present approach, in a sharp contrast to\nconventional meson-exchange models. It is shown that this three-body force\ngives at least half the $3N$ total binding energy, while the weight of\nnon-nucleonic components in the $^3$H and $^3$He wavefunctions can exceed 10%.\nThe new force model provides a very good description of $3N$ bound states with\na reasonable magnitude of the $\\sigma NN$ coupling constant. A new Coulomb $3N$\nforce between the third nucleon and dibaryon is found to be very important for\na correct description of the Coulomb energy and r.m.s. charge radius in $^3$He.\nIn view of the new results for Coulomb displacement energy obtained here for\nA=3 nuclei, an explanation for the long-term Nolen--Schiffer paradox in nuclear\nphysics is suggested.

We extend the\nvariational method to a poor solvent regime where the balance between the\ntwo-body attractive and the three-body repulsive interactions leads to\ncontraction of the chain to form a globule. By employing the Ginzburg\ncriterion, we recover the correct scaling for the $\\theta$-temperature. The\nintroduction of the three-body interaction term in the variational scheme\nrecovers the correct scaling for the two important length scales in the globule\n- its overall size $R$, and the thermal blob size $\\xi_{T}$. Since these two\nlength scales follow very different statistics - Gaussian on length scales\n$\\xi_{T}$, and space filling on length scale $R$ - our approach extends the\nvalidity of the uniform expansion method to non-uniform contraction rendering\nit applicable to polymeric systems with attractive interactions. We present one\nsuch application by studying the Rayleigh instability of polyelectrolyte\nglobules in poor solvents. At a critical fraction of charged monomers, $f_c$,\nalong the chain backbone, we observe a clear indication of a first-order\ntransition from a globular state at small $f$, to a stretched state at large\n$f$; in the intermediate regime the bistable equilibrium between these two\nstates shows the existence of a pearl-necklace structure.",

We analyze lattice data from the MILC\ncollaboration and demonstrate that the available lattice data combined with our\nknowledge of the physical values for the nucleon and delta masses lead to\nconsistent chiral extrapolation functions for both observables up to fairly\nlarge pion masses. This holds in particular for very recent data on the delta\nmass from the QCDSF collaboration. The resulting pion-nucleon sigma term is\nsigma_{piN} = 48.9 MeV. This first quantitative analysis of the quark-mass\ndependence of the structure of the Delta(1232) in full QCD within chiral\neffective field theory suggests that (the real part of) the nucleon-delta\nmass-splitting in the chiral limit, Delta_0 = 0.33 GeV, is slightly larger than\nat the physical point. Further analysis of simultaneous fits to nucleon and\ndelta lattice data are needed for a precision determination of the properties\nof the first excited state of the nucleon.",

The Jaynes MaxEnt approach\nfor deriving statistical mechanics is based on the adoption of (1) a specific\nentropic functional form S and (2) physically appropriate constraints. The\nliterature on non-extensive thermostatistics has considered, in its historical\nevolution, four possible choices for the evaluation of expectation values: (i)\n1988 Tsallis-original (TO), (ii) Curado-Tsallis (CT), (iii) Tsallis-Mendes-\nPlastino (TMP), and (iv) the same as (iii), but using centered operators as\nconstraints (OLM). The 1988 was promptly abandoned and replaced, mostly with\nversions ii) and iii). We will here (a) show that the 1988 is as good as any of\nthe others, (b) demonstrate that the four cases can be easily derived from just\none (any) of them, i.e., the probability distribution function in each of these\nfour instances may be evaluated with a unique formula, and (c) numerically\nanalyze some consequences that emerge from these four choices.",

    "summary": "The Complex Scaling Method (CSM) provides scattering wave functions which\nregularize resonances and suggest a resolution of the identity in terms of such\nresonances, completed by the bound states and a smoothed continuum. But, in the\ncase of inelastic scattering with many channels, the existence of such a\nresolution under complex scaling is still debated. Taking advantage of results\nobtained earlier for the two channel case, this paper proposes a representation\nin which the convergence of a resolution of the identity can be more easily\ntested. The representation is valid for any finite number of coupled channels\nfor inelastic scattering without rearrangement.",

Stars are\nassumed to be in rigid rotation and the grid of plane-parallel model\natmospheres used to represent the gravitational darkening are calculated by\nmeans of a non-LTE approach. Attention is paid on the relation between the\napparent and parent non-rotating counterpart stellar fundamental parameters and\napparent and true vsini parameters as a function of the rotation rate\nOmega/Omega_c, stellar mass and inclination angle. It is shown that omission of\ngravitational darkening in the analysis of chemical abundances of CNO elements\ncan produce systematic overestimation or underestimation, depending on the\nlines used, rotational rate and inclination angle. The proximity of Be stars to\nthe critical rotation is re-discussed by correcting not only the vsini of 130\nBe stars, but also their effective temperature and gravity to account for\nstellar rotationally induced geometrical distortion and for the concomitant\ngravitational darkening effect. We concluded that the increase of the vsini\nestimate is accompanied by an even higher value of the stellar equatorial\ncritical velocity, so that the most probable average rate of angular velocity\nof Be stars attains Omega/Omega_c ~ 0.88.",

Our\nanalysis leads to the identification of the (k,l) indices of nine periods\nobserved in the star PG 1219+534, and to the determination of its structural\nparameters. The periods all correspond to low-order acoustic modes with\nadjacent values of k and with l=0, 1, 2, and 3. They define a band of unstable\nmodes, in close agreement with nonadiabatic pulsation theory. Furthermore, the\naverage dispersion between the nine observed periods and the periods of the\ncorresponding nine theoretical modes of the optimal model is only ~0.6%,\ncomparable to the results of a similar analysis carried out by Brassard et al.\n(2001) on the rapid sdB pulsator PG 0014+067. On the basis of our combined\nspectroscopic and asteroseismic analysis, the inferred global structural\nparameters of PG 1219+534 are Teff = 33,600 +/- 370 K, log g = 5.8071 +/-\n0.0057, log Menv/M* = -4.254 +/- 0.147, M* = 0.457 +/- 0.012 Msun, R/Rsun =\n0.1397 +/- 0.0028, and L/Lsun = 22.01 +/- 1.85.

Finally, if we interpret the absence\nof fine structure (frequency multiplets) as indicative of a slow rotation rate\nof that star, we further find that PG 1219+534 rotates with a period longer\nthan 3.4 days, and has a maximum rotational broadening velocity of Vsin i <~\n2.1 km/s.",

This fact is connected to the\nmodifications undergone by the area located around a well after drilling in\nrelation to in situ state of stress. There are overstressed and understressed\nvertical cylindrical zones with \"bubble-shaped\" cross-sections, in which\nacoustic body waves are supposed to reflect. The horizontal size and the shape\nof the stress modified areas depend on the values of (K1+K2)/2 - with K1=SH/Sv\n(the overburden pressure) and K2=Sh/Sv -, that is to say on the in situ\nhorizontal stress and the anisotropy of this stress. The calculation of the\nvelocities of the P and S double waves allows us to evaluate the radial\nthicknesses of these stress modified areas. As their values are different\naccording to whether they result from P or S waves, we propose an explanation\nbased on their wavelengths.

    "summary": "Quantum computers are expected to be considerably more efficient than\nclassical computers for the execution of some specific tasks. The difficulty in\nthe practical implementation of thoose computers is to build a microscopic\nquantum system that can be controlled at a larger mesoscopic scale. Here I show\nthat vertical lines of donor atoms embedded in an appropriate Zinc Oxide\nsemiconductor structure can constitute artificial molecules that are as many\ncopy of the same quantum computer. In this scalable architecture, each unit of\ninformation is encoded onto the electronic spin of a donor. Contrary to most\nexisting practical proposals, here the logical operations only require a global\ncontrol of the spins by electromagnetic pulses. Ensemble measurements simplify\nthe readout. With appropriate improvement of its growth and doping methods,\nZinc Oxide could be a good semiconductor for the next generation of computers.",

    "summary": "Currently, the best available probe of the early phase of gamma-ray burst\n(GRB) jet attributes is the prompt gamma-ray emission, in which several\nintrinsic and extrinsic variables determine GRB pulse evolution. Bright,\nusually complex bursts have many narrow pulses that are difficult to model due\nto overlap. However, the relatively simple, long spectral lag, wide-pulse\nbursts may have simpler physics and are easier to model. In this work we\nanalyze the temporal and spectral behavior of wide pulses in 24 long-lag\nbursts, using a pulse model with two shape parameters -- width and asymmetry --\nand the Band spectral model with three shape parameters. We find that pulses in\nlong-lag bursts are distinguished both temporally and spectrally from those in\nbright bursts: the pulses in long spectral lag bursts are few in number, and ~\n100 times wider (10s of seconds), have systematically lower peaks in nu*F(nu),\nharder low-energy spectra and softer high-energy spectra. We find that these\nfive pulse descriptors are essentially uncorrelated for our long-lag sample,\nsuggesting that at least five parameters are needed to model burst temporal and\nspectral behavior. However, pulse width is strongly correlated with spectral\nlag; hence these two parameters may be viewed as mutual surrogates. We infer\nthat accurate formulations for estimating GRB luminosity and total energy will\ndepend on several gamma-ray attributes, at least for long-lag bursts. The\nprevalence of long-lag bursts near the BATSE trigger threshold, their\npredominantly low nF(n) spectral peaks, and relatively steep upper power-law\nspectral indices indicate that Swift will detect many such bursts.",

    "summary": "I briefly argue for logical necessity to incorporate, besides c, hbar, two\nfundamental length scales in the symmetries associated with the interface of\ngravitational and quantum realms. Next, in order to clear the proverbial bush,\nI discuss the CPT and indistinguishability issue related to recent non-linear\ndeformations of special relativity and suggest why algebraically well-defined\nextensions of special relativity do not require non-linear deformations. That\ndone, I suggest why the stable Snyder-Yang-Mendes Lie algebra should be\nconsidered as a serious candidate for the symmetries underlying freely falling\nframes at the interface of gravitational and quantum realms; thus echoing, and\ncomplementing, arguments recently put forward by Chryssomalakos and Okon. In\nthe process I obtain concrete form of uncertainty relations which involve\nabove-indicated length scales and a new dimensionless constant. I draw\nattention to the fact that because superconducting quantum interference devices\ncan carry roughly 10^{23} Cooper pairs in a single quantum state, Planck-mass\nquantum systems already exist in the laboratory. These may be used for possible\nexploration of the interface of the gravitational and quantum realms.",

Combining data from the Gemini Deep\nDeep and the Sloan Digital Sky Surveys to make mass-matched samples\n(M*>=10^10.2 Msun), with 25 and 50,255 galaxies, respectively), we find that\nthe fraction of galaxies in an HDS phase has decreased from about 50% at z=1.2\nto a few percent today. This decrease in fraction is due to an actual decrease\nin the number density of massive HDS systems by a factor of 2-4, coupled with\nan increase in the number density of massive galaxies by about 30 percent. We\nshow that this result depends only weakly on the threshold chosen for the\nHdelta equivalent width to define HDS systems (if greater than 4 A) and\ncorresponds to a (1+z)^{2.5\\pm 0.7} evolution. Spectral synthesis studies of\nthe high-redshift population using the PEGASE code, treating Hdelta_A, EW[OII],\nDn4000, and rest-frame colors, favor models in which the Balmer absorption\nfeatures in massive Hdelta-strong systems are the echoes of intense episodes of\nstar-formation that faded about 1 Gyr prior to the epoch of observation.

In the quantum Hall regime, two\ncounterpropagating edge channels are coupled by tunneling in the constrictions,\nthus forming a closed electron interference path.For several fixed front gate\nvoltages, we observe periodic Aharonov-Bohm interference oscillations in\nfour-terminal resistance as a function of the enclosed flux.

We find\nthat in most cases, the onset times align close to a straight line as a\nfunction of inverse velocity. Despite this, the estimated injection time can be\nin error by several minutes. Also, the estimated path length can deviate\ngreatly from the actual path length along the interplanetary magnetic field.\nThe major difference between the estimated and actual path lengths implies that\nthe first arriving particles cannot be viewed as moving directly along the\ninterplanetary magnetic field.",

This means that a\nquantum state becomes specified by more indefinite data. The above spread\nresembles, without being an exact analogy, a transfer of energy to smaller and\nsmaller scales observed in the hydrodynamical turbulence. There, in spite of\nthe presence of dissipation (in a form of kinematic viscosity), energy is still\nconserved. The analogy with the information spread in classical to quantum\ntransition means that in this process the information is also conserved. To\nillustrate that, we show (using as an example a specific case of a coherent\nquantum oscillator) how the Shannon information density continuously changes in\nthe above transition . In a more general scheme of things, such an analogy\nallows us to introduce a \"dissipative\" term (connected with the information\nspread) in the Hamilton-Jacobi equation and arrive in an elementary fashion at\nthe equations of classical quantum mechanics (ranging from the Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nto Klein-Gordon equations).

Of the 21 cluster candidates 7 are\nspectroscopically confirmed in the literature. Exploiting the optical data\navailable for these fields we discover that 68% of the X-ray cluster candidates\nare associated with optical galaxy overdensities. We also attempt to constrain\nthe redshifts of our cluster candidates using photometric methods. We thus\nconstruct the photometric redshift distribution of galaxies in the vicinity of\neach X-ray selected cluster candidate and search for statistically significant\nredshift peaks against that of the background distribution of field galaxies.\nComparison of the photometric with spectroscopic redshift estimates for the\nconfirmed clusters suggest that our simple method is robust out to z~0.5. For\nclusters at higher z, deeper optical data are required to estimate reliable\nphotometric redshifts. Finally, using the sample of the 19 serendipitous X-ray\nselected cluster candidates we estimate their surface density down to\nf(0.5-2keV) ~ 6x10^{-15} cgs and find it to be in fair agreement with previous\nand recent studies.",

An essential\ncomponent of the NLO contributions is due to energy conservation effects, and\nin this paper we present a model for implementing such effects together with\nsaturation in Mueller's dipole evolution formalism. We find that energy\nconservation severely dampens the small-x rise of the gluon density and, as a\nconsequence, the onset of saturation is delayed. Using a simple model for the\nproton we obtain a reasonable qualitative description of the x-dependence of F2\nat low Q^2 as measured at HERA even without saturation effects.

The model assumes the radially extended inward radio emission\nalong the local direction of the magnetic field, and the pulsar as the\nabsorber. The geometry of the magnetic field lines of the rotating dipole is\nfavourable for the double eclipse events, which we identify with the double\nnotches observed in pulse profiles of nearby pulsars. For pulsars with large\ndipole inclinations 70 <~ alpha <~ 110 deg the double notches are predicted to\noccur within a narrow phase range of 20 to 30 deg before the main radio peak.\nApplication of the model to PSR B0950+08 establishes it as a nearly orthogonal\nrotator (alpha =~ 75 deg, beta =~ -10 deg) with many pulse components naturally\ninterpreted in terms of the inward radio emission from a large range of\naltitudes. The inward components include the intermittently strong, leading\ncomponent of the main pulse, which would traditionally have been interpeted as\na conal emission in the outward direction. The model also identifies the\nmagnetic field lines along which the radially extended inward radio emission\noccurs in B0950+08. These have a narrow range of the footprint parameter s\nclose to 1.1 (closed field line region, near the last open field lines). We\ndescribe directional characteristics of inward emission from the radially\nextended region and compare them with characteristics of extended outward\nemission.

We assume that each ring spawns a small number (N <=\n6) of protostars, and that the condensation of the protostars is sufficiently\nrapid that they can subsequently be treated as point masses. We simulate the\ndynamical evolution of a ring of N stars and record the properties of the\nsingle stars, binaries and higher multiples that form as a result of the\ndissolution of the ring. The masses of the individual stars in a ring are drawn\nfrom a log-normal distribution with dispersion \\sigma. This part of the model\nis perfomed for many different realizations of the ring, to obtain good\nstatistics. The second part of the model is to convolve the results of these\ndimensionless simulations, first with the distribution of core masses, which\nyields the distributions of multiplicity,mass ratio and eccentricity, as a\nfunction of primary mass; and second with the distribution of core angular\nmomenta, which yields the distributions of semi-major axis and period, again as\na function of primary mass. Using the observed distribution of core masses, and\nthe observed distribution of core angular momenta, our model is able to\nreproduce the observed IMF, the observed high multiplicity frequency of\npre-Main Sequence stars, the observed distribution of separations, and -- for\nlong-period systems -- the observed distributions of eccentricity and\nmass-ratio, provided we invoke N = 4 or 5 and $\\sigma = 0.6$.

By using of a selective population technique, we investigate\nequilibration processes between the edge states in bilayer electron structures\nwith a high tunnelling rate between layers. Unexpected flattening of the I-V\ncurves in perpendicular magnetic field at a specific filling factor combination\nand the recovery of the conventional nonlinear I-V characteristics in tilted\nfields give a strong evidence for the existence of topological defects.",

    "summary": "The pulse profile of pulsar B1822-09 exhibits a very peculiar kind of mode\nchanging: a \"precursor\" appearing just in front of the Main-Pulse (MP) exhibits\nperiods of nulling, during which an interpulse (IP) becomes detectable at\nrotation phase separated by roughly 180 deg from the precursor. We propose that\nthis bizarre phenomenon, which requires an information transfer between the two\ncomponents, occurs by means of reversal of a direction of coherent radio\nemission generated in the same emission region. This interpretation naturally\nexplains the lack of weak radio emission in the off-pulse regions, as well as\nthe problem of information transfer between emission regions associated with\nthe MP precursor and the IP. The reversals also imply nulling. The model has\nprofound physical implications: (i) the mechanism of coherent radio emission\nmust allow radiation into two, opposite, intermittently changing directions;\n(ii) the radio waves must be able to propagate through inner regions of the\nneutron star magnetosphere with strong magnetic field. Most importantly, the\nmodel implies inward radio emission in pulsar magnetosphere.",

We investigate the convergence,\nstability, and optimal complexity of the scheme. This constitutes a theoretical\nadvantage, for example, with respect to adaptive finite element schemes for\nwhich convergence and complexity results are still hard to prove. The use of\nframes is further motivated by their redundancy, which, at least numerically,\nhas been shown to improve the conditioning of the corresponding discretization\nmatrices. Frames also are usually easier to construct than Riesz bases.\nFinally, we show how to apply the adaptive scheme we propose for finding an\napproximation to the solution of the PDEs governing magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\nflows, once suitable frame expansions are constructed.",

    "summary": "This paper examines the effect of soft handoff on the uplink user capacity of\na CDMA system consisting of a single macrocell in which a single hotspot\nmicrocell is embedded. The users of these two base stations operate over the\nsame frequency band. In the soft handoff scenario studied here, both macrocell\nand microcell base stations serve each system user and the two received copies\nof a desired user's signal are summed using maximal ratio combining. Exact and\napproximate analytical methods are developed to compute uplink user capacity.\nSimulation results demonstrate a 20% increase in user capacity compared to hard\nhandoff. In addition, simple, approximate methods are presented for estimating\nsoft handoff capacity and are shown to be quite accurate.",

We find that the compact tri-interstitial moves by a collective\ndisplacement, involving both translation and rotation, of five atoms in a\nscrew-like motion along $[111]$ directions. The elucidation of this pathway\ndemonstrates the utility of combining tight-binding molecular dynamics with\n\\textit{ab initio} density functional calculations to probe diffusion\nmechanisms. Using density functional theory to obtain diffusion barriers and\nthe prefactor, we calculate a diffusion constant of $ 4 \\cdot 10^{-5} \\exp (-\n0.49 {\\rm eV} / k_{B} T) {\\rm cm^2/s} $. Because of the low diffusion barrier,\n$I_{3}^{b}$ diffusion may be an important process under conditions such as ion\nimplantation that creates excess interstitials, hence favoring formation of\ninterstitial clusters.",

These\nnano-templates are produced either by depositing an alien oxide film or by\noxidizing a metal/metal oxide substrate.",

In each\ncase, the velocity dispersion - characterized by the spectrum fitting parameter\nb - increases with the level of excitation, a phenomenon that has previously\nbeen detected by the Copernicus and IMAPS observatories. In particular, we show\nwith 4 sigma confidence that for HD 192639 it is not possible to fit all J\nlevels with a single b value, and that higher b values are needed for the\nhigher levels. The amplitude of the line broadening, which can be as high as 10\nkm s^-1, makes explanations such as inhomogeneous spatial distribution\nunlikely. We investigate a mechanism in which the broadening is due to the\nmolecules that are rotationally excited through the excess energy acquired\nafter their formation on a grain (H2-formation pumping). We show that different\ndispersions would be a natural consequence of this mechanism. We note however\nthat such process would require a formation rate 10 times higher then what was\ninferred from other observations. In view of the difficulty to account for the\nvelocity dispersion as thermal broadening (T would be around 10,000 K), we\nconclude then that we are most certainly observing some highly turbulent warm\nlayer associated with the cold diffuse cloud. Embedded in a magnetic field, it\ncould be responsible for the high quantities of CH+ measured in the cold\nneutral medium.",

Thermal unfolding is stochastic whereas mechanical unfolding occurs\nin \"quantized steps\" with great variations in the step lengths.

In\nparticular, the radio continuum emission is asymmetrically extended to the\nnorth and skewed to the west. The Halpha image shows numerous HII complexes\nalong the southern edge of the gas disk, possibly indicating star formation\ntriggered by the ICM pressure. BVR images at 0.5\" resolution obtained with the\nWIYN Tip-Tilt Imager show a remarkable dust lane morphology: at half the\noptical radius, the dust lane of the galaxy curves up and out of the disk,\nmatching the HI morphology. Large dust plumes extend upward for ~1.5 kpc from\nluminous young star clusters at the SE edge of the truncated gas disk. These\nstar clusters are very blue, indicating very little dust reddening, which\nsuggests dust blown away by an ICM wind at the leading edge of the interaction.\nTo the south of the main ridge of interstellar material, where the galaxy is\nrelatively clean of gas and dust, we have discovered 1 kpc long linear dust\nfilaments with a position angle that matches the extraplanar radio continuum\ntail; we interpret this angle as the projected ICM wind direction. One of the\nobserved dust filaments has an HII region at its head. We interpret these dust\nfilaments as large, dense clouds which were initially left behind as the\nlow-density ISM is stripped, but are then ablated by the ICM wind. These\nresults provide striking new evidence on the fate of molecular clouds in\nstripped cluster galaxies.",

The mean-field-like\nsingle-configuration approaches such as Hartree-Fock and local spin density,\nlacking correlation, incorrectly identify the ground state symmetry and give\ninaccurate values for the singlet-triplet splitting and the DOE. The Hubbard\nmodel gives qualitatively correct results for the ground state symmetry and\nsinglet-triplet splitting, but produces significant errors in the DOE because\nit ignores the fact that the strain is asymmetric even if the dots within a\nmolecule are identical. Finally, the Heisenberg model gives qualitatively\ncorrect ground state symmetry and singlet-triplet splitting only for rather\nlarge inter-dot separations, but it greatly overestimates the DOE as a\nconsequence of ignoring the electron double occupancy effect.",

    "summary": "We report the discovery of 105-ms X-ray pulsations from the compact central\nobject (CCO) in the supernova remnant Kes 79 using data acquired with the\nNewton X-Ray Multi-Mirror Mission. Two observations of the pulsar taken 6 days\napart yield an upper limit on its spin-down rate of dP/dt < 7E-14 s/s and no\nevidence for binary orbital motion. The implied energy loss rate is dE/dt <\n2E36 ergs/s, surface magnetic field strength is B_p < 3E12 G, and spin-down age\nis t > 24 kyr. The latter exceeds the remnant's estimated age, suggesting that\nthe pulsar was born spinning near its current period. The X-ray spectrum of PSR\nJ1852+0040 is best characterized by a blackbody model of temperature kT_BB =\n0.44 +/- 0.03 keV, radius R_BB approx. 0.9 km, and L_bol = 3.7E33 ergs/s at d =\n7.1 kpc. The sinusoidal light curve is modulated with a pulsed fraction of\n>45%, suggestive of a small hot spot on the surface of the rotating neutron\nstar. The lack of a discernible pulsar wind nebula is consistent with an\ninterpretation of PSR J1852+0040 as a rotation-powered pulsar whose spin-down\nluminosity falls below the empirical threshold for generating bright wind\nnebulae, dE/dt_c approx. 4E36 ergs/s. The age discrepancy implies that its\ndE/dt has always been below dE/dt_c, perhaps a distinguishing property of the\nCCOs. Alternatively, the X-ray spectrum of PSR J1852+0040 suggests a\nlow-luminosity AXP, but the weak inferred B_p field is incompatible with a\nmagnetar theory of its X-ray luminosity. So far, we cannot exclude accretion\nfrom a fall-back disk. The ordinary spin parameters discovered from PSR\nJ1852+0040 highlight the difficulty that existing theories of isolated neutron\nstars have in explaining the high luminosities and temperatures of CCO thermal\nX-ray spectra.",

However, the mean\n$f\\_{\\rm gas} in distant clusters shows some differences to local ones,\nindicating a departure from strict scaling. This result is consistent with the\nobserved evolution in the luminosity-temperature relation. We quantitatively\ninvestigate this departure from scaling laws. Within the local sample we used,\na moderate but clear variation of the amplitude of the gas mass fraction with\ntemperature is found, a trend that weakens in the outer regions. These\nvariations do not explain departure from scaling laws of our distant clusters.\nAn important implication of our results is that the gas fraction evolution, a\ntest of the cosmological parameters, can lead to biased values when applied at\nradii smaller than the virial radius. From our $XMM$ clusters, the apparent gas\nfraction at the virial radius is consistent with a non-evolving universal value\nin a high matter density model and not with a concordance.",

As a\nconsequence of the diffusion and relaxation processes of stellar ensembles, the\nolder the stellar population is, the smoother and more extended is its spatial\ndistribution. An underlying population of older stars is found throughout the\nbody of NGC 2366. The most notable feature of this older population is the\npresence of numerous relatively bright AGB stars. The number ratio of AGB to\nRGB stars and the average absolute brightness of AGB stars in NGC 2366 are\nappreciably higher than in the BCD VII Zw 403, indicating a younger age of the\nAGB stars in NGC 2366.

Motivated by recent results on the geometry of\nthe space of satisfying truth assignments of random k-SAT and NAE-k-SAT\nformulas, we introduce a simple twist on this basic model, which appears to\ndramatically increase its hardness.

In order\nto simulate dissipation effects due to the transfer of photons and/or neutrinos\nwithin the matter configuration, we introduce the flux factor, the variable\nEddington factor and a closure relation between them. Rotation in General\nRelativity is considered in the slow rotation approximation, i.e. tangential\nvelocity of every fluid element is much less than the speed of light and the\ncentrifugal forces are little compared with the gravitational ones. Solutions\nare properly matched, up to the first order in the Kerr parameter, to the\nexterior Kerr-Vaidya metric and the evolution of the physical variables are\nobtained inside the matter configuration. To illustrate the method we work out\nthree models with different equations of state and several closure relations.\nWe have found that, for the closure relations considered, the matching\nconditions implies that a total diffusion regime can not be attained at the\nsurface of the configuration. It has also been obtained that the eccentricity\nat the surface of radiating configurations is greater for models near the\ndiffusion approximation than for those in the free streaming out limit. At\nleast for the static ``seed'' equations of state considered, the simulation we\nperformed show that these models have differential rotation and that the more\ndiffusive the model is, the slower it rotates.",

In sharp contrast to the case\nfor magnetic fields parallel to the c axis or tilted from the $ab$ plane, it\nwas found that there are two kinds of resonance modes, which are split in\nenergy and possess two distinctly different magnetic field dependences. One\nalways lies higher in energy than the other and has a shallow minimum at about\n0.8 kOe, then increases linearly with magnetic field. On the other hand,\nanother mode begins to appear only in a magnetic field (from a few kOe and\nhigher) and has a weakly decreasing tendency with increasing magnetic field. By\ncomparing with a recent theoretical model the higher energy mode can naturally\nbe attributed to the Josephson plasma resonance mode propagating along the\nprimitive reciprocal lattice vector of the Josephson vortex lattice, whereas\nthe lower frequency mode is assigned to the novel phase collective mode of the\nJosephson vortex lattice, which has never been observed before.",

This significantly larger scatter requires that intrinsic TFR\nscatter is actually much larger than +/-0.30 mag, that field galaxies have an\nintrinsic TFR scatter much larger than cluster spirals, or that field galaxies\nhave a velocity dispersion relative to the Hubble flow in excess of 1000 km\ns-1.

An alternative explanation\nis that the measured redshifts of galaxies are composed of a cosmological\nredshift component predicted from the value of the Hubble Constant and a\nsuperimposed intrinsic redshift component previously identified in other\nstudies. This intrinsic redshift component may exceed 5000 km s-1 in individual\ngalaxies. In this alternative scenario a possible value for the Hubble Constant\nis 55-60 km s-1 Mpc-1.",

The gravitational potential well of an ultra-compact binary can\nenlarge the corotation radius and thus make it possible for accreting material\nto reach the surface of the NS in the low accretion rate case. Thus the\ngeneration of the absorption features should be similar to the case of\naccreting pulsars. The close equality of the energy loss by fast cooling of the\npostsupernova neutron star and the energy dissipation needed for a wide binary\nevolving to an ultra-compact binary demonstrates that the ultra-compact binary\nmay be formed in 10-100yr after the second supernova explosion. Moreover, the\nultra-compact binary hypothesis can well explain the the absence of optical\ncounterpart and the observed two black body emissions. We suggest a simple\nmethod which can test the binary nature directly with XMM-Newton and Chandra\nobservations.

    "summary": "Pairs of electrodes with nanometer separation (nano-gap) are achieved through\nan electromigration-induced break-junction (EIBJ) technique at room\ntemperature. Lithographically defined gold (Au) wires are formed by e-beam\nevaporation over oxide coated silicon substrates silanized with\n(3-Mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane (MPTMS) and then subjected to\nelectromigration at room temperature to create a nanometer scale gap between\nthe two newly formed Au electrodes. The Si-O-Si covalent bond at the SiO$_2$\nsurface and the Au-sulphur (Au-S) bond at the top evaporated Au side, makes\nMPTMS as an efficient adhesive monolayer between SiO$_2$ and Au. Although the\nAu wires are initially 2$\\mu$m wide, gaps with length $\\sim$1nm and width\n$\\sim$5nm are observed after breaking and imaging through a field effect\nscanning electron microscope (FESEM). This technique eliminates the presence of\nany residual metal interlink in the adhesion layer (chromium or titanium for Au\ndeposition over SiO$_2$) after breaking the gold wire and it is much easier to\nimplement than the commonly used low temperature EIBJ technique which needs to\nbe executed at 4.2 K. Metal-molecule-metal structures with symmetrical\nmetal-molecule contacts at both ends of the molecule, are fabricated by forming\na self-assembled monolayer of -dithiol molecules between the EIBJ created Au\nelectrodes with nanometer separation. Electrical conduction through single\nmolecules of 1,4-Benzenedimethanethiol (XYL) is tested using the Au/XYL/Au\nstructure with chemisorbed gold-sulfur (Au-S) coupling at both contacts.",

    "summary": "The antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model is considered for spins $s_{i}={1/2}$\nlocated on the vertices of the dodecahedron and the icosahedron, which belong\nto the point symmetry group $I_{h}$. Taking into account the permutational and\nspin inversion symmetries of the Hamiltonian results in a drastic reduction of\nthe dimensionality of the problem, leading to full diagonalization for both\nclusters. There is a strong signature of the frustration present in the systems\nin the low energy spectrum, where the first excited states are singlets.\nFrustration also results in a doubly-peaked specific heat as a function of\ntemperature for the dodecahedron. Furthermore, there is a discontinuity in the\nmagnetization as a function of magnetic field for the dodecahedron, where a\nspecific total spin sector never becomes the ground state in a field. This\ndiscontinuity is accompanied by a magnetization plateau. The calculation is\nalso extended for $s_{i}=1$ where both systems again have singlet excitations.\nThe magnetization of the dodecahedron has now two discontinuities in an\nexternal field and also magnetization plateaux, and the specific heat of the\nicosahedron a two-peak structure as a function of temperature. The similarities\nbetween the two systems suggest that the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on\na larger cluster with the same symmetry, the 60-site cluster, will have similar\nproperties.",

Both near the center and among the most outlying PNs we have found\nseveral examples of very strong [O III] 5007, about 20 times brighter than\nHbeta. This, together with strong [Ne III] lines, implies a lower limit for O\nand Ne abundances near solar at the center and also at more than two effective\nradii from the center of NGC 4697. Thus we have found, for the first time from\nindividual stars, direct evidence of the existence of a metal-rich population\nin elliptical galaxies, confirming metallicities derived from absorption-line\nindices and extending the information to angular distances where the stellar\nsurface brightness is too low for absorption-line studies. A comparison with\nabundances obtained closer to the center of NGC 4697 from integrated\nabsorption-line spectra indicates that the metallicity gradient, which is quite\nsteep within one effective radius, becomes much less pronounced beyond one\neffective radius. The only alternative to this interpretation would be the\npresence of a very metal-poor PN population with [Z/H] below -1, which we\ncannot rule out but would require an extremely bimodal metallicity distribution\nwith almost no intermediate metallicities.",

We extend the data to galaxy clusters in the 2MASS catalog and\nstudy the relation between central galaxy luminosity and halo mass. While the\ncentral galaxy luminosity scales as ~M^{0.7-0.8} at low masses, the relation\nflattens to ~M^{<0.3} above ~4x10^{13} M_sun. The total luminosity of galaxies\nin the halo, however, continues to grow as a power-law ~M^{0.8-0.9}. Starting\nfrom the hypothesis that the central galaxies grow by merging (\"galactic\ncannibalism\"), we develop a simple model for the evolution of their\nluminosities as a consequence of the accretion of satellite galaxies. The\nluminosity-mass relation flattens when the time scale on which dynamical\nfriction induces orbital decay in the satellite galaxies exceeds the age of the\ndark matter halo. Then, the growth of the central galaxy is suppressed as it\ncan cannibalize only the rare, massive satellite galaxies. The model takes the\ndependence of the total luminosity of galaxies in a halo on its mass and the\nglobal galaxy luminosity function as input, and reproduces the observed central\ngalaxy luminosity-mass relation over three decades in halo mass,\n(10^{12}-10^{15}) M_sun.\n  The success of the model suggests that gas cooling and subsequent star\nformation did not play an important role in the final assembly of central\ngalaxies from sub-L_star precursors.",

    "summary": "We derive and analyze a class of spherically symmetric cosmological models\nwhose source is an interactive mixture of inhomogeneous cold dark matter (DM)\nand a generic homogeneous dark energy (DE) fluid. If the DE fluid corresponds\nto a quintessense scalar field, the interaction term can be associated with a\nwell motivated non--minimal coupling to the DM component. By constructing a\nsuitable volume average of the DM component we obtain a Friedman evolution\nequation relating this average density with an average Hubble scalar, with the\nDE component playing the role of a repulsive and time-dependent $\\Lambda$ term.\nOnce we select an ``equation of state'' linking the energy density ($\\mu$) and\npressure ($p$) of the DE fluid, as well as a free function governing the radial\ndependence, the models become fully determinate and can be applied to known\nspecific DE sources, such as quintessense scalar fields or tachyonic fluids.\nConsidering the simple equation of state $p= (\\gamma-1) \\mu$ with $0\\leq\\gamma\n<2/3$, we show that the free parameters and boundary conditions can be selected\nfor an adequate description of a local DM overdensity evolving in a suitable\ncosmic background that accurately fits current observational data. While a DE\ndominated scenario emerges in the asymptotic future, with total $\\Omega$ and\n$q$ tending respectively to 1 and -1/2 for all cosmic observers, the effects of\ninhomogeneity and anisotropy yield different local behavior and evolution rates\nfor these parameters in the local overdense region. We suggest that the models\npresented can be directly applied to explore the effects of various DE\nformalisms on local DM cosmological inhomogeneities.",

Direct applications\nto molecular biology are rigorous estimates of the mutation rates of polymerase\nchain reactions from uniform samples of the population after the reaction.\nFirst, we consider nonhomogeneous processes, which are more adapted to real\nreactions. Second, recalling that the first moment estimator is analytically\nknown only in the infinite population limit, we provide rigorous confidence\nintervals for this estimator that are valid for any finite population. Our\nbounds are explicit, nonasymptotic and valid for a wide class of nonhomogeneous\nbranching Markov processes that we describe in detail. In the setting of\npolymerase chain reactions, our results imply that enlarging the size of the\nsample becomes useless for surprisingly small sizes. Establishing confidence\nintervals requires precise estimates of the second moment of random samples.\nThe proof of these estimates is more involved than the proofs that allowed us,\nin a previous paper, to deal with the first moment. On the other hand, our\nmethod uses various, seemingly new, monotonicity properties of the harmonic\nmoments of sums of exchangeable random variables.",

First, we analyzed\nstructures of the superconducting-state conductivity reflecting the coupling of\nthe quasiparticles to the resonance mode observed by neutron scattering. The\nconductivity computed with the input spin susceptibility in the simple form of\nthe mode exhibits two prominent features: an onset of the real part of the\nconductivity starting around the frequency of the mode omega_{0} and a maximum\nof a related function W(omega), roughly proportional to the second derivative\nof the scattering rate, centered approximately at\nomega=omega_{0}+Delta_{0}/hbar, where Delta_{0} is the maximum value of the\nsuperconducting gap. The two structures are well known from earlier studies.\nTheir physical meaning, however, has not been sufficiently elucidated thus far.\nOur analysis involving quasiparticle spectral functions provides a clear\ninterpretation. Second, we explored the role played by the spin-fluctuation\ncontinuum. Third, we investigated the temperature dependence of the\nconductivity, of the intraband spectral weight, and of the effective kinetic\nenergy. The changes of the latter two quantities below Tc are determined by the\nformation of the gap, by a feedback effect of the spin fluctuations on the\nquasiparticles, and by a significant shift of the chemical potential.",

    "summary": "Generalized likelihood ratio statistics have been proposed in Fan, Zhang and\nZhang [Ann. Statist. 29 (2001) 153-193] as a generally applicable method for\ntesting nonparametric hypotheses about nonparametric functions. The likelihood\nratio statistics are constructed based on the assumption that the distributions\nof stochastic errors are in a certain parametric family. We extend their work\nto the case where the error distribution is completely unspecified via newly\nproposed sieve empirical likelihood ratio (SELR) tests. The approach is also\napplied to test conditional estimating equations on the distributions of\nstochastic errors. It is shown that the proposed SELR statistics follow\nasymptotically rescaled \\chi^2-distributions, with the scale constants and the\ndegrees of freedom being independent of the nuisance parameters. This\ndemonstrates that the Wilks phenomenon observed in Fan, Zhang and Zhang [Ann.\nStatist. 29 (2001) 153-193] continues to hold under more relaxed models and a\nlarger class of techniques. The asymptotic power of the proposed test is also\nderived, which achieves the optimal rate for nonparametric hypothesis testing.\nThe proposed approach has two advantages over the generalized likelihood ratio\nmethod: it requires one only to specify some conditional estimating equations\nrather than the entire distribution of the stochastic error, and the procedure\nadapts automatically to the unknown error distribution including\nheteroscedasticity. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate our proposed\nprocedure empirically.",

To\ninvestigate this problem, we calibrate the photometric method of determining\nthe metallicity of the RRab star (Kovacs and Zsoldos 1995) to the I-band and\napply it to the OGLE Galactic Bulge and LMC data.

Through\nsampling in this way the algorithm is able to accurately recover relatively\ncomplex signals without increasing the long-run average expense of sampling. It\nachieves this level of performance by exploiting the opportunities for\nnear-real time sampling that are available if one uses a relatively high\nprimary resolution level when constructing the basic wavelet estimator. In the\npractical problems that motivate the work, where signal to noise ratio is\nparticularly high and the long-run average sampling rate may be several hundred\nthousand operations per second, high primary resolution levels are quite\nfeasible.",

One is based on the idea of counting the number\nof modes of a bootstrap version of a standard kernel density estimator. We\nargue that the simplest form of that method suffers from the same difficulties\nthat inhibit level accuracy of Silverman's bandwidth-based test for modality:\nthe conditional distribution of the bootstrap form of a density estimator is\nnot a good approximation to the actual distribution of the estimator. This\ndifficulty is less pronounced if the density estimator is oversmoothed, but the\nproblem of selecting the extent of oversmoothing is inherently difficult. It is\nshown that the optimal bandwidth, in the sense of producing optimally high\nsensitivity, depends on the widths of putative bumps in the unknown density and\nis exactly as difficult to determine as those bumps are to detect. We also\ndevelop a second approach to ascribing a probability to shape, using Muller and\nSawitzki's notion of excess mass. In contrast to the context just discussed, it\nis shown that the bootstrap distribution of empirical excess mass is a\nrelatively good approximation to its true distribution. This leads to empirical\napproximations to the likelihoods of different levels of ``modal sharpness,''\nor ``delineation,'' of modes of a density. The technique is illustrated\nnumerically.",

The present paper\nprovides theoretical and numerical descriptions of the extent to which the\nnumber of modes is a nonmonotone function of bandwidth in the case of general\ncompactly supported densities. Our results address popular kernels used in\npractice, for example, the Epanechnikov, biweight and triweight kernels, and\nshow that in such cases nonmonotonicity is present with strictly positive\nprobability for all sample sizes n\\geq3. In the Epanechnikov and biweight cases\nthe probability of nonmonotonicity equals 1 for all n\\geq2. Nevertheless, in\nspite of the prevalence of lack of monotonicity revealed by these results, it\nis shown that the notion of a critical bandwidth (the smallest bandwidth above\nwhich the number of modes is guaranteed to be monotone) is still well defined.\nMoreover, just as in the Gaussian case, the critical bandwidth is of the same\nsize as the bandwidth that minimises mean squared error of the density\nestimator. These theoretical results, and new numerical evidence, show that the\nmain effects of nonmonotonicity occur for relatively small bandwidths, and have\nnegligible impact on many aspects of bump hunting.",

Of these, we present new data for 11 objects not\npreviously observed at submillimetre wavelengths and additional data for a\nfurther 3. The detection rate is 42 per cent, much higher than typically\nreported for samples of QSOs. Detection statistics show (at the 3-4 sigma\nlevel) that this sample of absorbed QSOs has a higher submillimetre output than\na matched sample of unabsorbed QSOs. We argue that the far-infrared luminosity\nis produced by massive star formation. In this case, the correlation found\nbetween far-infrared luminosity and redshift can be interpreted as cosmological\nevolution of the star-formation rate in the QSO host galaxies. Since the\nsubmillimetre luminous phase is confined to z>1.5, the high star formation\nrates are consistent with a scenario in which the QSOs evolve to become local\nluminous elliptical galaxies.\n  Combining these results with previously published data for X-ray unabsorbed\nQSOs and submillimetre-selected galaxies we propose the following evolutionary\nsequence: the forming galaxy is initially far-infrared luminous but X-ray weak\nsimilar to the sources discovered by the Submillimetre Common-User Bolometer\nArray; as the black hole and spheroid grow with time a point is reached when\nthe central QSO becomes powerful enough to terminate the star formation and\neject the bulk of the fuel supply (the Compton-thin absorbed QSO phase); this\ntransition is followed by a period of unobscured QSO activity which\nsubsequently declines to leave a quiescent spheroidal galaxy.",

Such systems, commonly called\nnetworked virtual environments (NVEs), are usually based on a client-server\narchitecture where for performance reasons and bandwidth restrictions, the\nsimulation is partially deferred to the clients. This inevitable architectural\nchoice renders the simulation vulnerable to attacks against the semantic\nintegrity of the simulation: malicious clients may attempt to compromise the\nphysical and logical laws governing the simulation, or to alter the causality\nof events a posteriori. In this paper, we initiate the systematic study of\nsemantic integrity in NVEs from a security point of view. We argue that naive\npolicies to enforce semantic integrity involve intolerable network load, and\nare therefore not practically feasible. We present a new semantic integrity\nprotocol based on cryptographic primitives which enables the server system to\naudit the local computations of the clients on demand. Our approach facilitates\nlow network and CPU load, incurs reasonable engineering overhead, and maximally\ndecouples the auditing process from the soft real time constraints of the\nsimulation.",

Here we revisit the kinematics and dynamics of null hypersurfaces by\nmaking use of some 3+1 slicing of spacetime. In particular, the additional\nstructures induced on null hypersurfaces by the 3+1 slicing permit a natural\nextension to the full spacetime of geometrical quantities defined on the null\nhypersurface. This 4-dimensional point of view facilitates the link between the\nnull and spatial geometries. We proceed by reformulating the isolated horizon\nstructure in this framework. We also reformulate previous works, such as\nDamour's black hole mechanics, and make the link with a previous 3+1 approach\nof black hole horizon, namely the membrane paradigm. We explicit all\ngeometrical objects in terms of 3+1 quantities, putting a special emphasis on\nthe conformal 3+1 formulation.

We confirm that the source is dominated by a pure Compton\nreflection component and an iron K$\\alpha$ line, both produced as reflection\nfrom a Compton-thick torus, likely responsible also for the large column\ndensity which is pierced by the primary powerlaw only at high energies. A low\ninclination angle and an iron underabundance, suggested by the amount of\nreflection and the depth of the iron edge, are consistent with the iron\nK$\\alpha$ line EW with respect to the Compton reflection component. Moreover,\nthe iron line width, if interpreted in terms of Doppler broadening due to the\nKeplerian rotation of the torus, puts an estimate to the inner radius of the\nlatter, $r=0.6^{+1.3}_{-0.3} \\sin^2{i}$ pc. Finally, two different photoionised\nreflectors are needed to take into account a large number of soft X-ray\nemission lines from N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, Fe L and the FeXXV emission line. RGS\nspectra show that the soft X-ray spectrum is dominated by emission lines, while\nthe underlying continuum is best fitted by an unabsorbed powerlaw with the same\nphoton index of the primary continuum, produced as reflection by a photoionised\nmaterial with a column density of a few $10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. We also present\nthe first X-ray spectrum of ROSAT source IXO30, which shows a huge iron line\nand is well represented either by an absorbed powerlaw or bremsstrahlung\nemission. Its spectral properties point to a likely identification in terms of\na weak Galactic Cataclysmic Variable, but the lack of any optical counterpart\nprecludes excluding other possibilities, like an ULX at the distance of Mrk3.",

The effective\nmass model is used to describe the slowly varying spatial envelope\nwavefunctions of spinless electrons near the Fermi level at two inequivalent\nvalleys (K-points) in terms of the four component Dirac equation for massless\nfermions, with the role of spin assumed by pseudospin due to the relative\namplitude of the wave function on the sublattice atoms (``A'' and ``B''). Using\nboundary conditions at the ends of the tube that neither break valley\ndegeneracy nor mix pseudospin eigenvectors, we use degenerate perturbation\ntheory to show that the presence of impurities has two effects. Firstly, the\nposition of the impurity with respect to the spatial variation of the envelope\nstanding waves results in a sinusoidal oscillation of energy level shift as a\nfunction of energy. Secondly, the position of the impurity within the hexagonal\ngraphite unit cell produces a particular 4 by 4 matrix structure of the\ncorresponding effective Hamiltonian. The symmetry of this Hamiltonian with\nrespect to pseudospin flip is related to degeneracy breaking and, for an\narmchair tube, the symmetry with respect to mirror reflection in the nanotube\naxis is related to pseudospin mixing.",

We show that, in the limit of rigid grains, the shear state is\ndetermined by a single dimensionless number, called inertial number I, which\ndescribes the ratio of inertial to pressure forces. Small values of I\ncorrespond to the quasi-static regime of soil mechanics, while large values of\nI correspond to the collisional regime of the kinetic theory. Those shear\nstates are homogeneous, and become intermittent in the quasi-static regime.\nWhen I increases in the intermediate regime, we measure an approximately linear\ndecrease of the solid fraction from the maximum packing value, and an\napproximately linear increase of the effective friction coefficient from the\nstatic internal friction value. From those dilatancy and friction laws, we\ndeduce the constitutive law for dense granular flows, with a plastic Coulomb\nterm and a viscous Bagnold term. We also show that the relative velocity\nfluctuations follow a scaling law as a function of I. The mechanical\ncharacteristics of the grains (restitution, friction and elasticity) have a\nvery small influence in this intermediate regime. Then, we explain how the\nfriction law is related to the angular distribution of contact forces, and why\nthe local frictional forces have a small contribution to the macroscopic\nfriction.

This young stellar object has been observed on 42 nights\nover a period of 6 years from 1998 to 2003. We have obtained 287 independent\nmeasurements of the fringe visibility with 6 different baselines ranging from\n20 to 110 meters in length, in the H and K bands. Our extensive (u,v)-plane\ncoverage, coupled with the published spectral energy distribution data, allows\nus to test the accretion disk scenario. We find that the most probable\nexplanation for these observations is that FU Ori hosts an active accretion\ndisk whose temperature law is consistent with standard models. We are able to\nconstrain the geometry of the disk, including an inclination of 55 deg and a\nposition angle of 47 deg. In addition, a 10 percent peak-to-peak oscillation is\ndetected in the data (at the two-sigma level) from the longest baselines, which\nwe interpret as a possible disk hot-spot or companion. However, the oscillation\nin our best data set is best explained with an unresolved spot located at a\nprojected distance of 10 AU at the 130 deg position angle and with a magnitude\ndifference of DeltaK = 3.9 and DeltaH = 3.6 mag moving away from the center at\na rate of 1.2 AU/yr. we propose to interpret this spot as the signature of a\ncompanion of the central FU Ori system on an extremely eccentric orbit. We\nspeculate that the close encounter of this putative companion and the central\nstar could be the explanation of the initial photometric rise of the luminosity\nof this object.",

    "summary": "We have obtained deep near-infrared images in J and K filters of three fields\nin the Sculptor galaxy NGC 300 with the ESO VLT and ISAAC camera. For 16\nCepheid variables in these fields, we have determined J and K magnitudes at two\ndifferent epochs, and have derived their mean magnitudes in these bands. The\nslopes of the resulting period-luminosity relations are in very good agreement\nwith the slopes of these relations measured in the LMC by Persson et al.\nFitting the LMC slopes to our data, we have derived distance moduli in J and K.\nUsing these values together with the values derived in the optical V and I\nbands in our previous work, we have determined an improved total reddening for\nNGC 300 of E(B-V)=0.096 +/- 0.006 mag, which yields extremely consistent values\nfor the absorption-corrected distance modulus of the galaxy from VIJK bands.\nOur distance result for NGC 300 from this combined optical/near infrared\nCepheid study is (m-M)_0 = 26.37 +/- 0.04 (random) +/- 0.03 (systematic) mag\nand is tied to an adopted true LMC distance modulus of 18.50 mag. Both random\nand systematic uncertainties are dominated by photometric errors, while errors\ndue to reddening, metallicity effects and crowding are less important. Our\ndistance determination is consistent with the earlier result from near-infrared\n(H-band) photometry of two Cepheids in NGC 300 by Madore et al., but far more\naccurate. Our distance value also agrees with the HST Key Project result of\nFreedman et al., and with the recent distance estimate for NGC 300 from Butler\net al. from the TRGB I-band magnitude when our improved reddening is used to\ncalculate the absorption corrections. Our distance results from the different\noptical and near-infrared bands indicate that the reddening law in NGC 300 must\nbe very similar to the Galactic one.",

Physical mechanisms\nleading to this relaxation of spin memory typically involve either coupling of\nthe electron spin to its orbital motion or to nuclear spins. Relaxation of\nconfined electron spin has been previously measured only for Zeeman or exchange\nsplit spin states, where spin-orbit effects dominate relaxation, while spin\nflips due to nuclei have been observed in optical spectroscopy studies. Using\nan isolated GaAs double quantum dot defined by electrostatic gates and direct\ntime domain measurements, we investigate in detail spin relaxation for\narbitrary splitting of spin states. Results demonstrate that electron spin\nflips are dominated by nuclear interactions and are slowed by several orders of\nmagnitude when a magnetic field of a few millitesla is applied. These results\nhave significant implications for spin-based information processing.",

That debate often centers on the nature (bound\nvs. unbound) of extended populations of stars. However, the more fundamental\nissue of the very existence of the extended populations is still contentious.\nWe present an evaluation of the debate centering on one particular dSph,\nCarina, for which claims both for and against the existence of stars beyond the\nKing radius have been made. Our review includes an examination of all previous\nstudies bearing on the Carina radial profile and shows that the survey method\nwhich achieves the highest detected dSph signal-to-background in the outer\nparts of the galaxy is the Washington M, T2 + DDO51 (MTD) filter approach from\nPaper II in this series. We then address statistical methods used to evaluate\nthe reliability of MTD surveys in the presence of photometric errors and for\nwhich a new, a posteriori statistical analysis methodology is provided.\nFinally, these statistical methods are tested by new spectroscopy of stars in\nthe MTD-selected Carina candidate sample. Of 74 candidate giants with follow-up\nspectroscopy, the MTD technique identified 61 new Carina members, including 8\nstars outside the King radius. From a sample of 29 stars not initially\nidentified as candidate Carina giants but that lie just outside of our\nselection criteria, 12 have radial velocities consistent with membership,\nincluding 5 extratidal stars. Carina is shown to have an extended population of\ngiant stars extending to a major axis radius of 40' (1.44x the nominal King\nradius).",

It is shown that the\ndifference between using $g^{\\alpha \\beta}$ as opposed to $h^{\\alpha \\beta}$\nappears only in two spacetime dimensions. Despite there being a different\nnumber of constraints in these two approaches, both formulations result in\nthere being a local Poisson brackets algebra of constraints with field\nindependent structure constants, closed off shell generators of gauge\ntransformations and off shell invariance of the action. The formulation in\nterms of the metric tensor is analyzed in detail and compared with earlier\nresults obtained using the metric density. The gauge transformations, obtained\nfrom the full set of first class constraints, are different from a\ndiffeomorphism transformation in both cases.",

Multi-frequency archival radio data from the VLA and MERLIN\nare analyzed, and the synchrotron spectra of these high-power hotspots are\npresented. We estimate that their break frequencies are in the range of\n$10^{10}-10^{11}$ Hz, with large uncertainties due to the wide gap in frequency\ncoverage between the radio and optical bands. We also calculate their\nequipartition magnetic fields, and find that the anti-correlation between break\nfrequency and magnetic field found by Brunetti et al. for lower power hotspots\nextends to these high power hotspots. This supports their model of hot-spots\nbased on shock acceleration and synchrotron losses.",

    "summary": "This paper discusses the properties of the inner puffed-up rim which forms in\ncircumstellar disks when dust evaporates. We argue that the rim shape is\ncontrolled by a fundamental property of circumstellar disks, namely their very\nlarge vertical density gradient, through the dependence of grain evaporation\ntemperature on gas density. As a result, the bright side of the rim is\n\"curved\", rather than \"vertical\", as expected when a constant evaporation\ntemperature is assumed. We have computed a number of rim models, which take\ninto account this effect in a self-consistent way. The results show that the\ncurved rim (as the vertical rim) emits most of its radiation in the near and\nmid-IR, and provides a simple explanation to the observed values of the near-IR\nexcess (the \"3 micron bump\" of Herbig Ae stars). Contrary to the vertical rim,\nfor curved rims the near-IR excess does not depend much on the inclination,\nbeing maximum for face-on objects. We have then computed synthetic images of\nthe curved rim seen under different inclinations; face-on rims are seen as\nbright, centrally symmetric rings on the sky; increasing the inclination, the\nrim takes an elliptical shape, with one side brighter than the other.",

From the absolute magnitudes of the variables calculated from these\ndistances, we find that the LMC Cepheids define tight period-luminosity\nrelations in the V, I, W,\n  J and K bands which agree exceedingly well with the corresponding Galactic PL\nrelations derived from the same technique, and are significantly steeper than\nthe LMC PL relations in these bands observed by the OGLE-II Project in V, I and\nW, and by Persson et al. in J and K. We find that the tilt-corrected true\ndistance moduli of the LMC Cepheids show a significant dependence on period,\nwhich hints at a systematic error in the ISB technique related to the period of\nthe stars. We identify as the most likely culprit the p-factor which converts\nthe radial into pulsational velocities; our data imply a much steeper period\ndependence of the p-factor than previously thought, and we derive p=1.58\n(+/-0.02) -0.15 (+/-0.05) logP as the best fit from our data, with a zero point\ntied to the Milky Way open cluster Cepheids. Using this revised p-factor law,\nthe period dependence of the LMC Cepheid distance moduli disappears, and at the\nsame time the Milky Way and LMC PL relations agree among themselves, and with\nthe directly observed LMC PL relations, within the 1 sigma uncertainties. Our\nmain conclusion is that the previous, steeper Galactic PL relations were caused\nby an erroneous calibration of the p-factor law, and that there is now evidence\nthat the slope of the Cepheid PL relation is independent of metallicity up to\nsolar metallicity, in both optical, and near-infrared bands.",

Using GIM2D, the images are fit with\ntwo-dimensional surface brightness models consisting of a simple disk and bulge\ncomponent to derive B/T, the fraction of luminosity in the bulge. We find that\nthe galaxies with weak or absent Halpha or [OII] emission (known as k+a\ngalaxies) are predominantly bulge-dominated (with a mode of B/T~0.6), while\ngalaxies with nebular emission (known as e[a] galaxies) are mostly\ndisk-dominated (B/T~0.1). The morphologies and (r-k) colours of most k+a\ngalaxies are inconsistent with the hypothesis that they result from the\ntruncation of star formation in normal, spiral galaxies. However, their (u-g)\nand (r-k) colours, as well as their Hdelta line strengths, form a sequence that\nis well matched by a model in which >5 per cent of the stellar mass has been\nproduced in a recent starburst. The lack of scatter in the dust-sensitive (r-k)\ncolours suggests that the unusual spectra of k+a galaxies are not due to the\neffects of dust. The e(a) galaxies, on the other hand, have a colour\ndistribution that is distinct from the k+a population, and typical of normal or\ndusty (tauV~2) spiral galaxies. We conclude that many e(a) galaxies are not\nprogenitors of k+a galaxies, but are a separate phenomenon. Both k+a and e(a)\ngalaxies reside in environments (characterized by the local density of galaxies\nbrighter than Mr=-20) that are typical of normal galaxies and that are\ninconsistent with overdense regions like rich galaxy clusters.",

Secondly, the faint-end slope of\nthe LF appears to become shallower at higher redshift.

The post-outburst lightcurve clearly separates into\nearly times when the WD flux is high, and late times when the flux is near the\nquiescent level. The break between these two regimes, occurring at a time of\norder the outburst duration, corresponds to a thermal diffusion wave reaching\nthe base of the freshly accreted layer. Our principal result is that long after\nthe outburst, the fractional flux perturbation about the quiescent flux decays\nas a power law with time (and {\\it not} as an exponential). We use this result\nto construct a simple fitting formula that yields estimates for both the\nquiescent flux and the accreted column, i.e. the total accreted mass divided by\nWD surface area. The WD mass is not well constrained by the late time\nlightcurve alone, but it can be inferred if the accreted mass is known from\nobservations. We compare our work with the well-studied outburst of WZ Sge,\nfinding that the cooling is well described by our model, giving an effective\ntemperature $T_{\\rm eff}=14,500 {\\rm K}$ and accreted column $\\Delta\ny\\approx10^6 {\\rm g cm^{-2}}$, in agreement with the modeling of Godon et al.\nTo reconcile this accreted column with the accreted mass inferred from the\nbolometric accretion luminosity, a large WD mass $\\gtrsim1.1M_\\odot$ is needed.\nOur power law result is a valuable tool for making quick estimates of the\noutburst properties. We show that fitting the late time lightcurve with this\nformula yields a predicted column within 20% of that estimated from our full\nnumerical calculations.",

On the other hand, if these voids formed much later, their effect on the\nCMB will be negligible and will not be observed with the current generation of\nexperiments. In this paper presented at the 2004 Annual Scientific Meeting of\nthe Astronomical Society of Australia, we discuss our ongoing investigations\ninto voids of primordial origin. We show that if voids in the cold dark matter\ndistribution existed at the epoch of decoupling, they could contribute\nsignificantly to the apparent rise in CMB power on small scales detected by the\nCosmic Background Imager (CBI) Deep Field. Here we present our improved method\nfor predicting the effects of primordial voids on the CMB in which we treat a\nvoid as an external source in the cold dark matter (CDM) distribution employing\na Boltzmann solver. Our improved predictions include the effects of a\ncosmological constant (Lambda) and acoustic oscillations generated by voids at\nearly times. We find that models with relatively large voids on the last\nscattering surface predict too much CMB power in an Einstein--de Sitter\nbackground cosmology but could be consistent with the current CMB observations\nin a Lambda-CDM universe.",

This\nobservation has been mimicked in our model where the nodes pop-up at randomly\nlocated positions in the Euclidean space and are connected to one end of the\nnearest link. In spite of this crucial difference it is observed that the\nleading behaviour of our network is like the BA model. Defining link weight as\nan algebraic power of its Euclidean length, the weight distribution and the\nnon-linear dependence of the nodal strength on the degree are analytically\ncalculated. It is claimed that a power law decay of the link weights with time\nensures such a non-linear behavior.

The Knudsen flow effects are\nimportant for almost all types of semiconductor nanostructures but we find them\nmost pronounced in Si and SiC systems due to the very large phonon mean-free\npaths. We apply and test our wire thermal-transport results to recent\nmeasurements on Si nanowires. We further investigate and predict size effects\nin typical multilayered SiC nanostructures, for example, a\ndoped-SiC/SiC/SiO$_2$ layered structure that could define the transport channel\nin a nanosize transistor. Here the phonon-interface scattering produces a\nheterostructure thermal conductivity smaller than what is predicted in a\ntraditional heat-transport calculation, suggesting a breakdown of the\ntraditional Fourier analysis even at room temperatures. Finally, we show that\nthe effective thermal transport in a SiC/SiO$_2$ heterostructure is sensitive\nto the oxide depth and could thus be used as an in-situ probe of the SiC\noxidation progress.",

We map the\nproblem to a spatially extended system to show that the synchronization\ntransition in delayed systems exhibits universal critical properties. We find\nthat the synchronization transition is absorbing and generically belongs to the\nuniversality class of the bounded Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation, as occurs in\nthe case of extended systems. We also argue that directed percolation critical\nbehavior may emerge for systems with strong nonlinearities",

We find that the Vc-sigma_c relation is descri ed by a linear law out\nto velocity dispersions as low as sigma_c~50km/s, while in previous works a\npower law was adopted for galaxies with sigma_c>80k/ms.\n  Elliptical galaxies with Vc based on dynamical models or directly derived\nfrom the HI rotation curves follow the same relation as the HSB galaxies in the\nVc-sigma_c plane.

This is true independent of the mathematical\nstructure used for describing such a formulation of quantum mechanics. A\nspecific model which exhibits this non-linearity is constructed, using the\nlanguage of noncommutative geometry. We derive a non-linear Schrodinger\nequation for the quantum dynamics of a particle; this equation reduces to the\nstandard linear Schrodinger equation when the mass of the particle is much\nsmaller than Planck mass. It turns out that the non-linear equation found by us\nis very similar to a non-linear Schrodinger equation found by Doebner and\nGoldin in 1992 from considerations of unitary representaions of the\ninfinite-dimensional group of diffeomorphisms in three spatial dimensions. Our\nanalysis suggests that the diffusion constant introduced by Doebner and Goldin\ndepends on the mass of the particle, and that this constant tends to zero in\nthe limit in which the particle mass is much smaller than Planck mass, so that\nin this limit the non-linear theory reduces to standard linear quantum\nmechanics. A similar effective non-linear Schrodinger equation was also found\nfor the quantum dynamics of a system of D0-branes, by Mavromatos and Szabo.",

The main feature of this\ndistribution can be presented as follows. Both shallow and deep active regions\ndemonstrate a clear dominance of one sign of current helicity in a given\nhemisphere during the whole cycle. Broadly speaking, current helicity has\nopposite polarities in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, although there\nare some active regions that violate this polarity rule. The relative number of\nactive regions violating the polarity rule is significantly higher for deeper\nactive regions. A separation of active regions into `shallow', `middle' and\n`deep' is made by comparing their rotation rate and the helioseismic rotation\nlaw. We use a version of Parker's dynamo model in two spatial dimensions, that\nemploys a nonlinearity based on magnetic helicity conservation arguments. The\npredictions of this model about the radial distribution of solar current\nhelicity appear to be in remarkable agreement with the available observational\ndata; in particular the relative volume occupied by the current helicity of\n\"wrong\" sign grows significantly with the depth.",

Following a description of our\nscientific motivations and target selection criteria, the data reduction\nmethods are described; of critical importance the FLAMES reduction pipeline is\nfound to yield spectra that are in excellent agreement with less automated\nmethods. Spectral classifications and radial velocity measurements are\npresented for each star, with particular attention paid to morphological\npeculiarities and evidence of binarity. These observations represent a\nsignificant increase in the known spectral content of NGC 3293 and NGC 4755,\nand will serve as standards against which our subsequent FLAMES observations in\nthe Magellanic Clouds will be compared.",

A\nferromagnetic (FM) state with full spin polarization is achieved for B||a-axis,\nbut colossal magnetoresistance is realized only for B||b-axis. For B||c-axis,\nShubnikov-de Haas oscillations are observed and followed by a less resistive\nstate than for B||a.

These\nproperties together with highly unusual spin-charge-lattice coupling near the\nMott transition (48 K) are driven by the orbital degrees of freedom.",

We find the\ndistributions of M_B, Vrot, and scalelength, to be very similar for the two\nsamples. However, using the Tully-Fisher relation (TFR) we find that cluster\ngalaxies are systematically offset with respect to the field sample by\n-0.7+-0.2 mag. This offset is significant at 3 sigma and persists when we\naccount for an evolution of the field TFR with redshift. Extensive tests are\nperformed to investigate potential differences between the measured emission\nlines and derived rotation curves of the cluster and field samples. However, no\nsuch differences which could affect the derived Vrot values and account for the\noffset are found. The most likely explanation for the TFR offset is that giant\nspiral galaxies in distant clusters are on average brighter, for a given\nrotation velocity, than those in the field.

The\n$R^{-1}$-profile is called the critical profile. From this hypothesis, the\nfollowing is to be expected: at large radii, a ``subcritical'' profile (slope\nflatter than $R^{-1}$); at still larger radii a $B_\\phi$-profile becoming\nasymptotically critical as the density becomes asymptotically vanishing. Recent\nobservations of magnetic fields in NGC 6946 and the Milky Way are in very good\nagreement with these predictions.

    "summary": "An important problem in shape analysis is to match configurations of points\nin space filtering out some geometrical transformation. In this paper we\nintroduce hierarchical models for such tasks, in which the points in the\nconfigurations are either unlabelled, or have at most a partial labelling\nconstraining the matching, and in which some points may only appear in one of\nthe configurations. We derive procedures for simultaneous inference about the\nmatching and the transformation, using a Bayesian approach. Our model is based\non a Poisson process for hidden true point locations; this leads to\nconsiderable mathematical simplification and efficiency of implementation. We\nfind a novel use for classic distributions from directional statistics in a\nconditionally conjugate specification for the case where the geometrical\ntransformation includes an unknown rotation. Throughout, we focus on the case\nof affine or rigid motion transformations. Under a broad parametric family of\nloss functions, an optimal Bayesian point estimate of the matching matrix can\nbe constructed, that depends only on a single parameter of the family.\n  Our methods are illustrated by two applications from bioinformatics. The\nfirst problem is of matching protein gels in 2 dimensions, and the second\nconsists of aligning active sites of proteins in 3 dimensions. In the latter\ncase, we also use information related to the grouping of the amino acids. We\ndiscuss some open problems and suggest directions for future work.",

    "summary": "Modern classical computing devices, except of simplest calculators, have von\nNeumann architecture, i.e., a part of the memory is used for the program and a\npart for the data. It is likely, that analogues of such architecture are also\ndesirable for the future applications in quantum computing, communications and\ncontrol. It is also interesting for the modern theoretical research in the\nquantum information science and raises challenging questions about an\nexperimental assessment of such a programmable models. Together with some\nprogress in the given direction, such ideas encounter specific problems arising\nfrom the very essence of quantum laws. Currently are known two different ways\nto overcome such problems, sometime denoted as a stochastic and deterministic\napproach. The presented paper is devoted to the second one, that is also may be\ncalled the programmable quantum networks with pure states.\n  In the paper are discussed basic principles and theoretical models that can\nbe used for the design of such nano-devices, e.g., the conditional quantum\ndynamics, the Nielsen-Chuang \"no-programming theorem, the idea of deterministic\nand stochastic quantum gates arrays. Both programmable quantum networks with\nfinite registers and hybrid models with continuous quantum variables are\nconsidered. As a basic model for the universal programmable quantum network\nwith pure states and finite program register is chosen a \"Control-Shift\"\nquantum processor architecture with three buses introduced in earlier works. It\nis shown also, that quantum cellular automata approach to the construction of\nan universal programmable quantum computer often may be considered as the\nparticular case of such design.",

    "summary": "In this paper, we have studied the effect of strain relaxation on\nmagneto-transport properties of La_0.7Ca_0.3MnO_3 epitaxial films (200 nm\nthick), which were deposited by pulsed laser deposition technique under\nidentical conditions. All the films are epitaxial and have cubic unit cell. The\namount of strain relaxation has been varied by taking three different single\ncrystal substrates of SrTiO_3, LaAlO_3 and MgO. It has been found that for\nthicker films the strain gets relaxed and produces variable amount of disorder\ndepending on the strength of strain relaxation. The magnitude of lattice\nrelaxation has been found to be 0.384, 3.057 and 6.411 percent for film\ndeposited on SrTiO_3, LaAlO_3 and MgO respectively. The films on LaAlO_3 and\nSrTiO_3 show higher T_{IM} of 243 K and 217 K respectively as compared to\nT_{IM} of 191 K for the film on MgO. Similarly T_C of the films on SrTiO_3 and\nLaAlO_3 is sharper and has value of 245 K and 220 K respectively whereas the TC\nof the film on MgO is 175 K. Higher degree of relaxation creates more defects\nand hence TIM (T_C) of the film on MgO is significantly lower than of SrTiO_3\nand LaAlO_3. We have adopted a different approach to correlate the effect of\nstrain relaxation on magneto-transport properties of LCMO films by evaluating\nthe resistivity variation through Mott's VRH model. The variable presence of\ndisorder in these thick films due to lattice relaxation which have been\nanalyzed through Mott's VRH model provides a strong additional evidence that\nthe strength of lattice relaxation produces disorder dominantly by increase in\ndensity of defects such as stacking faults, dislocations, etc. which affect the\nmagneto-transport properties of thick epitaxial La_0.7Ca_0.3MnO_3 films.",

    "summary": "The direct detection of extrasolar planets by imaging means is limited by the\nlarge flux of light from the host star being scattered into the region of\ninterest by a variety of processes, including diffraction. Coronagraphs are\ndevices that suppress the undesirable scattering of light caused by\ndiffraction. In a coronagraph the sensitivity limit for high dynamic range is\nlimited by the propagation of errors introduced by the imperfect optical system\nto the final image. In this paper we develop theory and simulations to\nunderstand how such errors propagate in a coronagraph. We describe the response\nof classical and band-limited Lyot coronagraphs to small and large errors in\nthe placement of the central star, and identify ways of making such\ncoronagraphs more robust to small guiding errors. We also uncover features of\nthe decentered PSF that can lead to spurious detection of companions,\nespecially with aggressive, high dynamic range coronagraphs dedicated to\ncompanion searches aimed at finding extrasolar terrestrial or Jovian planets.",

The curves are peaked around\nthe periapse epoch, but two subpeaks may arise in nearly edge-on orbits, when\nthe source is behind or in front of Sgr A*. We show that for most of these\nstars the secondary image should be observable during its brightness peak. In\nparticular, S14 is the best candidate, since its secondary image reaches K=23.3\nwith an angular separation of 0.125 mas from the apparent horizon of the\ncentral black hole.

This result is confirmed with\nnumerical renormalization group calculations and perturbation theory in the\non-site interaction. In the Fermi-liquid fixed point, we determine the\ncorrelations of the electric current at zero temperature (shot noise) and\ndemonstrate that the Fano factor is suppressed below the Poissonian limit for\nthe symmetric point of the Anderson Hamiltonian even for nonzero lead\nmagnetizations. We discuss possible avenues of future research in this field:\ncoupling to the low energy excitations of the ferromagnets (magnons), extension\nto double quantum dot systems with interdot antiferromagnetic interaction and\neffect of spin-polarized currents on higher symmetry Kondo states such as\nSU(4).",

Hybrid equations of\nstate (EOSs) are adopted to mimic realistic nuclear EOSs. In this approach, we\ndivide the EOSs into two parts, i.e., the thermal part and the cold part. For\nthe cold part, we assign a fitting formula for realistic EOSs of cold nuclear\nmatter slightly modifying the formula developed by Haensel and Potekhin. We\nadopt the SLy and FPS EOSs for which the maximum allowed ADM mass of cold and\nspherical neutron stars (NSs) is ~ 2.04Mo and 1.80Mo, respectively. Simulations\nare performed for BNSs of the total ADM mass in the range between 2.4Mo and\n2.8Mo with the rest-mass ratio Q_M to be in the range 0.9 < Q_M < 1. It is\nfound that if the total ADM mass of the system is larger than a threshold\nM_{thr}, a black hole (BH) is promptly formed in the merger irrespective of the\nmass ratios. In the other case, the outcome is a hypermassive NS of a large\nellipticity, which results from the large adiabatic index of the realistic EOSs\nadopted. The value of M_{thr} depends on the EOS: ~ 2.7Mo and ~ 2.5Mo for the\nSLy and FPS EOSs, respectively. Gravitational waves are computed in terms of a\ngauge-invariant wave extraction technique. In the formation of the hypermassive\nNS, quasiperiodic gravitational waves of a large amplitude and of frequency\nbetween 3 and 4 kHz are emitted. The estimated emission time scale is < 100 ms,\nafter which the hypermassive NS collapses to a BH. Because of the long emission\ntime, the effective amplitude may be large enough to be detected by advanced\nlaser interferometric gravitational wave detectors if the distance to the\nsource is smaller than ~ 100 Mpc.",

The c2d Spitzer Legacy\nTeam's data reduction pipeline is described in detail. Over 1500 24 micron\nsources and 41 70 micron sources were detected by MIPS with fluxes greater than\n10-sigma. More than 40 potential YSOs are identified with a MIPS and 2MASS\ncolor-color diagram and by their spectral indices, including two previously\nunknown sources with 24 micron excesses. Our new SIMBA millimeter map of Cha II\nshows that only a small fraction of the gas is in compact structures with high\ncolumn densities. The extended emission seen by MIPS is compared with previous\nCO observations. Some selected interesting sources, including two detected at 1\nmm, associated with Cha II are discussed in detail and their SEDs presented.\nThe classification of these sources using MIPS data is found to be consistent\nwith previous studies.",

    "summary": "We extend spin-lattice relaxation theory to incorporate the use of pulsed\nmagnetic fields for probing the hysteresis effects and magnetization steps and\nplateaus exhibited, at low temperatures, by the dynamical magnetization of\nmagnetic molecules. The main assumption made is that the lattice degrees of\nfreedom equilibrate in times much shorter than both the experimental time scale\n(determined by the sweep rate) and the typical spin-lattice relaxation time. We\nfirst consider the isotropic case (a magnetic molecule with a ground state of\nspin $S$ well separated from the excited levels and also the general isotropic\nHeisenberg Hamiltonian where all energy levels are relevant) and then we\ninclude small off-diagonal terms in the spin Hamiltonian to take into account\nthe Landau-Zener-St\\\"{u}ckelberg (LZS) effect. In the first case, and for an\n$S=1/2$ magnetic molecule we arrive at the generalized Bloch equation recently\nused for the magnetic molecule \\{V$_6$\\} in Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 147204 (2005).\nAn analogous equation is derived for the magnetization, at low temperatures, of\nantiferromagnetic ring systems. The LZS effect is discussed for magnetic\nmolecules with a low spin ground state, for which we arrive at a very\nconvenient set of equations that take into account the combined effects of LZS\nand thermal transitions. In particular, these equations explain the deviation\nfrom exact magnetization reversal at $B\\approx 0$ observed in \\{V$_6$\\}. They\nalso account for the small magnetization plateaus (``magnetic Foehn effect''),\nfollowing the LZS steps, that have been observed in several magnetic molecules.\nFinally, we discuss the role of the Phonon Bottleneck effect at low\ntemperatures and specifically we indicate how this can give rise to a\npronounced Foehn effect.",

In particular, we examine\napproximate methods and analyses of (e,e') reactions developed by Traini et al.\nusing a high energy approximation of the distorted waves and phase shifts due\nto Lenz and Rosenfelder. This approximation has been used in the separation of\nlongitudinal and transverse structure functions in a number of (e,e')\nexperiments including the newly published 208Pb(e,e') data from Saclay. We find\nthat the assumptions used by Traini and others are not valid for typical (e,e')\nexperiments on medium and heavy nuclei, and hence the extracted structure\nfunctions based on this formalism are not reliable. We describe an improved\napproximation which is also based on the high energy approximation of Lenz and\nRosenfelder and the analyses of Knoll and compare our results to the Saclay\ndata. At each step of our analyses we compare our approximate results to the\nexact distorted wave results and can therefore quantify the errors made by our\napproximations. We find that for light nuclei, we can get an excellent\ntreatment of Coulomb distortion effects on (e,e') reactions just by using a\ngood approximation to the distorted waves, but for medium and heavy nuclei\nsimple additional ad hoc factors need to be included. We describe an explicit\nprocedure for using our approximate analyses to extract so-called longitudinal\nand transverse structure functions from (e,e') reactions in the quasielastic\nregion.",

One crucial aspect\nof U(1)' models is the existence of anomalies, cancellation of which may\nrequire the inclusion of exotic matter which in turn disrupts the unification\nof the gauge couplings. In this work we pursue the question of canceling the\nanomalies with a minimal matter spectrum and no exotics. This can indeed be\nrealized provided that U(1)' charges are family-dependent and the soft-breaking\nsector includes non-holomorphic operators for generating the fermion masses. We\nprovide the most general solutions for U(1)' charges by taking into account all\nconstraints from gauge invariance and anomaly cancellation. We analyze various\nlaboratory and astrophysical bounds ranging from fermion masses to relic\ndensity, for an illustrative set of parameters. The U(1)' charges admit\npatterns of values for which family nonuniversality resides solely in the\nlepton sector, though this does not generate leptonic FCNCs due to the U(1)'\ngauge invariance.",

    "summary": "We present predictions of Ly-alpha forest-galaxy correlations at z=3 from\nEulerian simulations that include the effects of galactic winds, driven\nprimarily by supernova explosions. Galactic winds produce expanding bubbles of\nshock-heated gas within ~0.5 comoving Mpc/h of luminous galaxies in the\nsimulation, which have space density similar to that of observed Lyman break\ngalaxies (LBGs). However, most of the low-density intergalactic gas that\ndetermines the observed properties of the Ly-alpha forest is unaffected by\nwinds. The impact of winds on the Ly-alpha optical depth near galaxies is less\ndramatic than their impact on gas temperature because winds heat only a small\nfraction of the gas present in the turnaround regions surrounding galaxies.\nHence, Ly-alpha absorption from gas outside the wind bubbles is spread out over\nthe same velocity range occupied by the wind-heated gas. In general, Ly-alpha\nabsorption is expected to be stronger than average near galaxies because of the\nhigh gas density. Winds result in a modest reduction of this expected increase\nof Ly-alpha absorption. Our predictions can be compared to future observations\nto detect the wind effects and infer their strength, although with the caveat\nthat the results are still dependent on the correspondence of simulated\ngalaxies and observed LBGs. We find that wind effects in our simulations are\nnot strong enough to reproduce the high Ly-alpha transmission within 0.5 Mpc/h\ncomoving of galaxies that has been suggested by recent observations; powerful\ngalactic explosions or ejecta with hyper-escape velocities would be required,\nbut these are unlikely to be produced by ordinary star formation and supernovae\nalone",

While the\ngas kinematics of the narrow-line region of active galaxies are primarily\ngoverned by the gravitational potential of the stars, the accretion rate, as\ntraced by the Eddington luminosity ratio, seems to play an important secondary\nrole.

We have followed galaxy formation in a dark matter halo, chosen to\nhave a relatively quiet recent merger history, using different models for star\nformation and feedback. In all cases, we have adopted a multi-phase description\nof the interstellar medium and modelled star formation in quiescent and burst\nmodes. We have explored two triggers for starbursts: strong shocks and high gas\ndensity, allowing for the possibility that stars in the burst may form with a\ntop-heavy initial mass function. We find that the final morphology of the\ngalaxy is extremely sensitive to the modelling of star formation and feedback.\nStarting from identical initial conditions, galaxies spanning the wide range of\nHubble types, with B-band disc-to-total luminosity ratios ranging from 0.25 to\n0.9, can form in the same dark matter halo. Models in which starbursts are\ninduced by high gas density (qualitatively similar to models in which feedback\nis produced by AGN) generate energetic winds and result in galaxies with an\nearly-type morphology. Models in which the starbursts are induced by strong\nshocks lead to extended discs. In this case, the feedback associated with the\nbursts suppresses the collapse of baryons in small halos, helping to create a\nreservoir of hot gas that is available for cooling after $z = 1$, following the\nbulk of the dynamical activity that builds up the halo. This gas then cools to\nform a large, young stellar disc.",

For $T <$ 10 K transport measurements show\nthat the zero-field resistivity $\\rho_{c}$ changes linearly with temperature\nand extrapolates nearly to zero at 0 K, indicative of non-Fermi-liquid (nFL)\nbehavior associated with a quantum critical point (QCP). The longitudinal\nmagnetoresistance (LMR) of CeCoIn$_{5}$ for fields applied parallel to the\nc-axis is negative and scales as $B/(T+T^{*})$ between 50 and 100 K, revealing\nthe presence of a single-impurity Kondo energy scale $T^{*} \\sim 2$ K.\nBeginning at 16 K a small positive LMR feature is evident for fields less than\n3 tesla that grows in magnitude with decreasing temperature. For higher fields\nthe LMR is negative and increases in magnitude with decreasing temperature.\nThis sizable negative magnetoresistance scales as $B{^2}/T$ from 2.6 K to\nroughly 8 K, and it arises from an extrapolated residual resistivity that\nbecomes negative and grows quadratically with field in the nFL temperature\nregime. Applying a magnetic field along the c-axis with B $>$ B$_{c2}$ restores\nFermi-liquid behavior in $\\rho_{c}(T)$ at $T$ less than 130 mK. Analysis of the\n$T{^2}$ resistivity coefficient's field-dependence suggests that the QCP in\nCeCoIn$_{5}$ is located \\emph{below} the upper critical field, inside the\nsuperconducting phase. These data indicate that while high-$T$ c-axis transport\nof CeCoIn$_{5}$ exhibits features typical for a heavy fermion system, low-$T$\ntransport is governed both by spin fluctuations associated with the QCP and\nKondo interactions that are influenced by the underlying complex electronic\nstructure intrinsic to the anisotropic CeCoIn$_{5}$ crystal structure.",

A small\nconcentration of magnetic defects within the structure drastically changes the\n7Li nuclear magnetization relaxation versus time from a pure exponential as in\npure LiV2O4 to a stretched exponential, indicating glassy behavior of the\nmagnetic defects. The stretched exponential function is described as arising\nfrom a distribution of 7Li nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rates and we present\na model for the distribution in terms of the dynamics of the magnetic defects.\nOur results explain the origin of recent puzzling 7Li NMR literature data on\nLiV2O4 and our model is likely applicable to other glassy systems.",

The\narea covered by the catalog is 4188 sq. deg. The quasar redshifts range from\n0.08 to 5.41, with a median value of 1.47; the high-redshift sample includes\n520 quasars at redshifts greater than four, of which 17 are at redshifts\ngreater than five. For each object the catalog presents positions accurate to\nbetter than 0.2 arcsec. rms per coordinate, five-band (ugriz) CCD-based\nphotometry with typical accuracy of 0.03 mag, and information on the morphology\nand selection method. The catalog also contains radio, near-infrared, and X-ray\nemission properties of the quasars, when available, from other large-area\nsurveys. The calibrated digital spectra cover the wavelength region 3800--9200A\nat a spectral resolution about 2000; the spectra can be retrieved from the\npublic database using the information provided in the catalog. A total of\n44,221 objects in the catalog were discovered by the SDSS; 28,400 of the SDSS\ndiscoveries are reported here for the first time.",

Our data consist of 143 data points taken over\neight nights in October 2004 and January 2005. The RMS variability over the\nlongest contiguous stretch of five nights of data spanning nine days is only\n1.3%. This subset of data alone constrain the amplitude of any long-period\nvariations with period P to be A<1% (P/20 days)^2. Over the course of any given\n5-hour segment, the data exhibits significant linear trends not seen in a\ncomparison star of similar magnitude, and in a few cases these segments show\nclear evidence for curvature at the level of a few millimagnitudes per hour^2.\nThese properties imply that the rotation period of Sedna is O(10 hours), cannot\nbe < 5 hours, and cannot be >10 days, unless the intrinsic light curve has\nsignificant and comparable power on multiple timescales, which is unlikely. A\nsinusoidal fit yields a period of P=(10.273 +/- 0.002) hours and semi-amplitude\nof A=(1.1 +/- 0.1)%. There are additional acceptable fits with flanking periods\nseparated by ~3 minutes, as well as another class of fits with P ~ 18 hours,\nalthough these later fits appear less viable based on visual inspection. Our\nresults indicate that the period of Sedna is likely consistent with typical\nrotation periods of solar system objects, thus obviating the need for a massive\ncompanion to slow its rotation.",

The first result indicates that in\nmaterials with broadly distributed microscopic heterogeneities, the fracture\nstrength distribution corresponding to the peak load of the material response\ndoes not follow the commonly used Weibull and (modified) Gumbel distributions.\nInstead, a {\\it lognormal} distribution describes more adequately the fracture\nstrengths corresponding to the peak load of the response. Lognormal\ndistribution arises naturally as a consequence of multiplicative nature of\nlarge number of random distributions representing the stress scale factors\nnecessary to break the subsequent \"primary\" bond (by definition, an increase in\napplied stress is required to break a \"primary\" bond) leading up to the peak\nload. Numerical simulations based on two-dimensional triangular and diamond\nlattice topologies with increasing system sizes substantiate that a {\\it\nlognormal} distribution represents an excellent fit for the fracture strength\ndistribution at the peak load. The second significant result of the present\nstudy is that, in materials with broadly distributed microscopic\nheterogeneities, the mean fracture strength of the lattice system behaves as\n$\\mu_f = \\frac{\\mu_f^\\star}{(Log L)^\\psi} + \\frac{c}{L}$, and scales as $\\mu_f\n\\approx \\frac{1}{(Log L)^\\psi}$ as the lattice system size, $L$, approaches\ninfinity.",

Rev. Lett. 91, 027001 (2003)), that\nshow a signal with two branches in the underdoped regime. On the other hand,\nupon including quenched disorder in the model and breaking the homogeneous\nstate into ``patches'' that are locally either superconducting or\nantiferromagnetic, the two-branch spectra can be reproduced. In this picture,\nthe nodal regions are caused by d-wave superconducting clusters. Studying the\ndensity of states (DOS), a pseudogap is observed, caused by the mixture of the\ngapped antiferromagnetic state and a d-wave superconductor. The local DOS can\nbe interpreted using a mixed-phase picture, similarly as observed in tunneling\nexperiments. It is concluded that a simple phenomenological model for cuprates\ncan capture many of the features observed in the underdoped regime of these\nmaterials.",
