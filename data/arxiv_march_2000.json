    "summary": "This paper works out the structure of singular points of p-adic differential\nequations (i.e. differential modules over the ring of functions analytic in\nsome annulus with external radius 1). Surprisingly results look like in the\nformal case (differential modules over a one variable power series field) but\nproofs are much more involved. However, unlike in the Turritin theorem, even\nafter ramification, in the p-adic theory there are irreducible objects of rank\n>1. The first part is devoted to the definition of p-adic slopes and to a\ndecomposition along p-adic slopes theorem. The case of slope 0 (p-adic analogue\nof the regular singular case) was already studied in the paper with the same\ntitle but number II [Ann. of Math. (2) 146 (1997), 345-410]. The second part\nstates several index existence theorems and index formulas. As a consequence,\nvertices of the Newton polygon built from p-adic slopes are proved to have\nintegral components (analogue of the Hasse-Arf theorem). After the work of the\nsecond author, existence of index implies finitness of p-adic\n(Monsky-Washnitzer) cohomology for affine varieties over finite fields. The end\nof the paper outlines the construction of a p-adic-coefficient category over\ncurves (over a finite field) with all needed finitness properties.\n  In the paper with the same title but number IV [Invent. Math. 143 (2001),\n629-672], further insights are given.",

    "summary": "Gevrey series are ubiquitous in analysis; any series satisfying some\n(possibly non-linear) analytic differential equation is Gevrey of some rational\norder. The present work stems from two observations: 1) the classical Gevrey\nseries, e.g. generalized hypergeometric series with rational parameters, enjoy\narithmetic counterparts of the Archimedean Gevrey condition; 2) the\ndifferential operators which occur in classical treatises on special functions\nhave a rather simple structure: they are either Fuchsian, or have only two\nsingularities, 0 and infinity, one of them regular, the other irregular with a\nsingle slope...\n  The main idea of the paper is that the arithmetic property 1) accounts for\nthe global analytic property 2): the existence of an injective arithmetic\nGevrey solution at one point determines to a large extent the global behaviour\nof a differential operator with polynomial coefficients.\n  Proofs use both p-adic and complex analysis, and a detailed arithmetic study\nof the Laplace transform.",

    "summary": "A fundamental goal of algebraic geometry is to do for singular varieties\nwhatever we can do for smooth ones. Intersection homology, for example,\ndirectly produces groups associated to any variety which have almost all the\nproperties of the usual homology groups of a smooth variety. Minimal model\ntheory suggests the possibility of working more indirectly by relating any\nsingular variety to a variety which is smooth or nearly so.\n  Here we use ideas from minimal model theory to define some characteristic\nnumbers for singular varieties, generalizing the Chern numbers of a smooth\nvariety. This was suggested by Goresky and MacPherson as a next natural problem\nafter the definition of intersection homology. We find that only a subspace of\nthe Chern numbers can be defined for singular varieties. A convenient way to\ndescribe this subspace is to say that a smooth variety has a fundamental class\nin complex bordism, whereas a singular variety can at most have a fundamental\nclass in a weaker homology theory, elliptic homology. We use this idea to give\nan algebro-geometric definition of elliptic homology: ``complex bordism modulo\nflops equals elliptic homology.''",

Such BIVACUUM, is an\ninfinitive source of Bivacuum fermions (BVF) and Bivacuum bosons (BVB). They\nmay assemble by 'head-to tail' principle the closed or open Virtual\nmicrotubules (VirMT) and Virtual Guides (VirG) of spin, momentum and energy.\nThe VirG represent quasi-1D Bose condensate and connect remote coherent\nelementary particles. The bundles of VirG composing 3D net in space, provide\nthe superfluid and nonlocal fraction of Bivacuum. The proposed Dynamic Model of\nCorpuscle [C]-Wave [W] duality interrelates the internal (hidden) parameters of\nsub-elementary fermions and their external, observable ones. The fusion of\nsub-elementary fermions to triplets at their symmetry shift determined by\nGolden mean conditions produce electrons, protons and neutrons. The different\nkind of Bivacuum matrix perturbation and excitation, accompanied [C-W]\npulsation of elementary fermions and their fast rotation, are responsible for\nelectrostatic, magnetic and gravitational fields excitation. The pace of time\nfor any closed system is shown to be determined by pace of internal kinetic\nenergy change of this system.

This merger-driven evolution not only\ninfluences the galaxy mass distribution function, but may drive the main\ngalactic activity cycles, such as starbursts and the activity in the nuclei\n(AGNs). In this paper, we use galaxy aggregation dynamics together with a\npossible merger-driven starburst and AGN phenomena, to study the effects of\nevlution of these consequential activities for the faint IRAS source counts and\nthe infra-red background. We find that the strong evolution of IRAS 60$ \\mu m$\nsource count at flux range of $10 mJy \\sim 1 Jy$ is difficult to be explained\nonly by the merger rate decrease with cosmic time. We need to assume a redshift\ndependent infrared burst phase of ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIGs) from\nthe gas rich mergers at high redshift and the gas poor mergers at low redshift.\nThe background intensity at 60$ \\mu m$ which we get from this aggregation\nevolution is a lower limit of only $1.9 nW m^{-2} sr^{-1}$, about half of those\nestimated by some previous models, but close to the lower end of the range\nderived by Malkan & Stecker (1998).",

Standard Cassegrain designs for\nradiotelescope optics exhibit focal surface curvature so large that detectors\ncannot be placed more than 25 beam diameters from the central ray. The problem\nis worse for Ritchey-Cretien designs, because these minimize coma while\nincreasing field curvature. Classical aberrations, including coma, are usually\ndominated by diffraction in submillimeter-wave single dish telescopes. The\ntelescope designer must consider (1) diffraction, (2) aberration, (3) curvature\nof field, (4) cross-polarization, (5) internal reflections, (6) the effect of\nblockages, (7) means of beam chopping on- and off-source, (8) gravitational and\nthermal deformations of the primary mirror, (9) the physical mounting of large\ndetector packages, and (10) the effect of gravity and (11) vibration on those\ndetectors. Simultaneous optimization of these considerations in the case of\nlarge detector arrays leads to telescopes that differ considerably from\nstandard radiotelescope designs. Offset optics provide flexibility for mounting\ndetectors, while eliminating blockage and internal reflections. Aberrations and\ncross-polarization can be the same as on-axis designs having the same diameter\nand focal length. Trade-offs include the complication of primary mirror\nhomology and an increase in overall cost. A dramatic increase in usable field\nof view can be achieved using shaped optics.

In conventional systems such as the Standard Model for\nquarks and leptons, this would lead to hidden variable theories, which are\nknown to be plagued by problems such as non-locality. But Planck scale physics\nis so different from field theories in some flat background space-time that\nhere the converse may be the case: we speculate that causality and locality can\nonly be restored by postulating a deterministic underlying theory.

To this purpose, the evolutionary status of the\nsample as well as the individual masses have been determined using the\nHIPPARCOS trigonometric parallax measurements to locate very precisely our\nsample stars in the HR diagram. We look at the distributions of A(Li) and Vsini\nwith mass when stars evolve from the main sequence to the subgiant branch. For\nmost of the stars in our sample we find good agreement with the dilution\npredictions. However, the more massive cool stars with upper limits of Li\nabundances show a significant discrepancy with the theoretical predictions,\neven if the Non-LTE effects are taken into account. For the rotation behaviour,\nour analysis confirms that low mass stars leave the main sequence with a low\nrotational rate, while more massive stars are slowed down only when reaching\nthe subgiant branch. We also checked the connection between the observed\nrotation behaviour and the magnetic braking due to the deepening of the\nconvective envelope. Our results shed new light on the lithium and rotation\ndiscontinuities in the evolved phase.",

To simplify the study we suggest a model in which parameters of a\nmedium are averaged over the ground-state wave function. The rectangular and\nthe Rosen-Morse potential are used as examples.\n  To describe the confined electron properties explicitly to the second order\nof perturbations in powers of the electron-phonon coupling constant we use the\nexact energy-dependent Green function for the Rosen-Morse confining potential.\nIn the case of the rectangular potential, the sum over all intermediate virtual\nstates is calculated. The comparison is made with the often used leading term\napproximation when only the ground-state is taken into account as a virtual\nstate. It is shown that the results are quite different, so the incorporation\nof all virtual states and especially those of the continuous spectrum is\nessential.\n  Our model reproduces the correct three-dimensional asymptotics at both small\nand large widths. We obtained a rather monotonous behavior of the polaron\nenergy as a function of the confining potential width and found a peak of the\neffective mass. The comparison is made with theoretical results by other\nauthors.

This ``cosmic shear'' is\npotentially the most direct measure of the mass power spectrum, as it is\nunaffected by poorly-justified assumptions made concerning the biasing of the\ndistribution. Our detection is based on an initial imaging study of 14\nseparated 8' x 16' fields observed in good, homogeneous conditions with the\nprime focus EEV CCD camera of the 4.2m William Herschel Telescope. We detect an\nrms shear of 1.6% in 8' x 8' cells, with a significance of 3.4 sigma. We\ncarefully justify this detection by quantifying various systematic effects and\ncarrying out extensive simulations of the recovery of the shear signal from\nartificial images defined according to measured instrument characteristics. We\nalso verify our detection by computing the cross-correlation between the shear\nin adjacent cells. Including (gaussian) cosmic variance, we measure the shear\nvariance to be (0.016)^2 plus/minus (0.012)^2 plus/minus (0.006)^2, where these\n1 sigma errors correspond to statistical and systematic uncertainties,\nrespectively. Our measurements are consistent with the predictions of\ncluster-normalised CDM models (within 1 sigma) but a COBE-normalised SCDM model\nis ruled out at the 3.0 sigma level. For the currently-favoured Lambda-CDM\nmodel (with Omega_m = 0.3), our measurement provides a normalisation of the\nmass power spectrum of sigma_8 = 1.5 plus/minus 0.5, fully consistent with that\nderived from cluster abundances. Our result demonstrates that ground-based\ntelescopes can, with adequate care, be used to constrain the mass power\nspectrum on various scales. The present results are limited mainly by cosmic\nvariance, which can be overcome in the near future with more observations.",

However, the\ncrossover temperature T^*, below which Matveev's two-channel Kondo scenario\n[K.A. Matveev, Phys. Rev.

Above T^* the 'infinite channel model' of\nRef.{onlinecite{Schoen}} turns out to be a rather good approximation. We\ndiscuss the experimental limitations and suggest a new experimental setup to\nobserve the multichannel Kondo behavior.",

The insulating\nground wavefunction in fact: (i) displays vanishing dc conductivity; (ii)\nsustains macroscopic polarization; and (iii) is localized. The idea that the\ninsulating state of matter is a consequence of electron localization was first\nproposed in 1964 by W. Kohn. I discuss here a novel definition of electron\nlocalization, rather different from Kohn's, and deeply rooted in the modern\ntheory of polarization. In fact the present approach links the two features\n(ii) and (iii) above, by means of essentially the same formalism. In the\nspecial case of an uncorrelated crystalline solid, the localization of the\nmany-body insulating wavefunction is measured - according to our definition -\nby the spread of the Wannier orbitals; this spread diverges in the metallic\nlimit. In the correlated case, the novel approach to localization is\ndemonstrated by means of a two-band Hubbard model in one dimension, undergoing\na transition from band insulator to Mott insulator.",

In this geometrical framework two\nsets of triads related by a local SO(3) transformation yield different\ndescriptions of the gravitational energy.

We assume that a central black-hole mass in NLS1 is\nrelatively small, $M \\sim 10^{5-7}M_\\odot$, and that a disk shines nearly at\nthe Eddington luminosity, $L_{\\rm E}$. Then, the disk becomes a slim disk and\nexhibits the following distinctive signatures: (1) The disk luminosity\n(particularly of X-rays) is insensitive to mass-flow rates, $\\dot M$, since the\ngenerated energy is partly carried away to the black hole by trapped photons in\naccretion flow. (2) The spectra are multi-color blackbody. The maximum\nblackbody temperature is $T_{\\rm bb} \\simeq 0.2(M/10^5 M_\\odot)^{-1/4}$ keV,\nand the size of the blackbody emitting region is small, $r_{\\rm bb} \\lsim 3\nr_{\\rm S}$ (with $r_{\\rm S}$ being Schwarzschild radius) even for a\nSchwarzschild black hole. (3) All the ASCA observation data of NLS1s fall onto\nthe region of $\\dot M/(L_{\\rm E}/c^2)>10$ (with $L_{\\rm E}$ being the Eddington\nluminosity) on the ($r_{\\rm bb},T_{\\rm bb}$) plane, supporting our view that a\nslim disk emits soft X-rays at $\\sim L_{\\rm E}$ in NLS1s. (4) Magnetic energy\ncan be amplified, at most, up to the equipartition value with the trapped\nradiation energy which greatly exceeds radiation energy emitted from the disk.\nHence, energy release by consecutive magnetic reconnection will give rise to\nsubstantial variability in soft X-ray emission.",

As an alternative to warm or collisional dark\nmatter, I postulate a condensate of massive bosons interacting via a repulsive\ninterparticle potential, plus gravity. This leads to a minimum lengthscale for\nbound objects, and to superfluidity. Galactic dynamics may differ significantly\nfrom that of more generic dark matter in not unwelcome ways, especially in the\ncore. Such particles can be realized as quanta of a relativistic massive scalar\nfield with a quartic self-interaction. At high densities, the equation of state\nhas the same form as that of an ideal relativistic gas despite the\ninteractions. If the nonrelativistic lengthscale is of order a kiloparsec, then\nthe energy density in these particles was comparable to that of photons at\nearly times, but small enough to avoid conflict with primordial\nnucleosynthesis.",

    "summary": "The atmospheric neutrino fluxes observed by underground detectors are not\nsymmetric for rotations around the vertical axis. The flux is largest\n(smallest) for the nu's traveling toward east (west). This asymmetry is the\nresult of the effects of the geomagnetic field on the primary cosmic rays and\non their showers. The size of the asymmetry is to a good approximation\nindependent from the existence of neutrino oscillations, and can in principle\nbe predicted without any ambiguity due to existence of unknown new physics. We\nshow that there is an interesting hint of discrepancy between the experimental\nmeasurement of the east-west asymmetry by Super-Kamiokande and the existing\ntheoretical predictions. We argue that the discrepancy is a real effect caused\nby the neglect, in the existing calculations, of the bending of the charged\nsecondary particles (in particular of the muons) in the cosmic ray showers. The\ninclusion of this effect in the calculation gives results in quantitative\nagreeement with the data. We comment on the implications of this result for the\nstudy of neutrino oscillations.",

However, whereas the amount of data entering a warehouse, the query\nloads, and the need to obtain up-to-date responses are all increasing, the time\nwindow available for making the warehouse up-to-date is shrinking. These trends\nnecessitate efficient techniques for the maintenance of materialized views.\n  In this paper, we show how to find an efficient plan for maintenance of a\n{\\em set} of views, by exploiting common subexpressions between different view\nmaintenance expressions. These common subexpressions may be materialized\ntemporarily during view maintenance. Our algorithms also choose\nsubexpressions/indices to be materialized permanently (and maintained along\nwith other materialized views), to speed up view maintenance. While there has\nbeen much work on view maintenance in the past, our novel contributions lie in\nexploiting a recently developed framework for multiquery optimization to\nefficiently find good view maintenance plans as above. In addition to faster\nview maintenance, our algorithms can also be used to efficiently select\nmaterialized views to speed up workloads containing queries.",

Query response times can be greatly\nimproved by caching final/intermediate results of previous queries, and using\nthem to answer later queries. In this paper we describe a caching system called\nExchequer which incorporates several novel features including optimization\naware cache maintenance and the use of a cache aware optimizer. In contrast, in\nexisting work, the module that makes cost-benefit decisions is part of the\ncache manager and works independent of the optimizer which essentially\nreconsiders these decisions while finding the best plan for a query. In our\nwork, the optimizer takes the decisions for the cache manager. Furthermore,\nexisting approaches are either restricted to cube (slice/point) queries, or\ncache just the query results. On the other hand, our work is extens ible and in\nfact presents a data-model independent framework and algorithm. Our\nexperimental results attest to the efficacy of our cache management techniques\nand show that over a wide range of parameters (a) Exchequer's query response\ntimes are lower by more than 30% compared to the best performing competitor,\nand (b) Exchequer can deliver the same response time as its competitor with\njust one tenth of the cache size.",

We develop a\nstrategy to deal with the influence of the hadronic structure on the decay\nproperties of the simplest hadron, the pion, and calculate the contribution of\nthe axial vector current to the RC, using a light-front model for the pion. Its\n$q\\bar{q}$ bound state structure is well described by two parameters,\nconstituent quark mass and confinement scale, that have been fixed by a\ncomparison with the data. We take into consideration three different groups of\ntwo-loop diagrams, and derive their light-front representations. We discuss the\nassociated zero-mode problem and show that the respective light-front\namplitudes are free of spurious contributions. There is only a small model\ndependent uncertainty of the final result for the RC for pion beta decay.",

The working fluid of the engine is composed of an\nensemble of noninteracting two level systems. External work is applied by\nchanging the external field and thus the internal energy levels. The friction\ninduces a minimal cycle time. The power output of the engine is optimized with\nrespect to time allocation between the contact time with the hot and cold baths\nas well as the adiabats. The engine's performance is also optimized with\nrespect to the external fields. By reversing the cycle of operation a heat pump\nis constructed. The performance of the engine as a heat pump is also optimized.\nBy varying the time allocation between the adiabats and the contact time with\nthe reservoir a universal behavior can be identified. The optimal performance\nof the engine when the cold bath is approaching absolute zero is studied. It is\nfound that the optimal cooling rate converges linearly to zero when the\ntemperature approaches absolute zero.",

We show that different spectral models can be fit equally well to\nBeppoSAX data of both galaxies. Metallicities are unreliable in general, with a\nstrong dependence on the choice of model. Preference to one particular spectral\nmodel can only be given by combining spectroscopic and imaging X-ray data from\nall available satellites (ROSAT, ASCA, and BeppoSAX). Based on spectra of NGC\n253, we demonstrate that a model consisting of two or more thermal plasma\ncomponents plus a hard power law continuum and Fe K alpha line emission can\nexplain all observations. These model components represent the integral\nspectrum of thermal gas and compact sources in starburst galaxies that are most\nlikely supernova remnants and X-ray binaries. The same model can fit the X-ray\ndata of M 82, but there the evidence, from ROSAT imaging, of the existence of\ncompact sources which might represent high-mass X-ray binaries is weaker.

The\nbasic ingredients going into the proof are the lattice Ward identity, charge\nconjugation symmetry and the power counting theorem. We compute the\nrenormalization constant to one loop order. It is largely independent of the\nparticular lattice realization of the current.",

The first one (E) corresponds to the asymptotic energy at\nlarge $|z|$, while the second one (D) specifies the value of z at the\nsingularity which characterizes such models. The E=D=0 solution is just the\nflat Friedmann model. The 1-parameter family of solutions with z>0 and D=0 are\ninhomogeneous cosmological models which expand from a Big Bang singularity at\nt=0 and are asymptotically Friedmann at large z; models with E>0 are everywhere\nunderdense relative to Friedmann and expand forever, while those with E<0 are\neverywhere overdense and recollapse to a black hole containing another\nsingularity. The black hole always has an apparent horizon but need not have an\nevent horizon. The D=0 solutions with z<0 are just the time reverse of the z>0\nones. The 2-parameter solutions with D>0 again represent inhomogeneous\ncosmological models but the Big Bang singularity is at $z=-1/D$, the Big Crunch\nsingularity is at $z=+1/D$, and any particular solution necessarily spans both\nz<0 and z>0. While there is no static model in the dust case, all these\nsolutions are asymptotically ``quasi-static'' at large $|z|$.

In\nparticular, we discuss the possible scatter in the data and argue that LiBeB\nproduction in the very early Galaxy was probably bimodal, with isolated\nsupernovae giving rise to a low-efficiency mechanism, and collective supernovae\nexploding in an OB association inducing a high-efficiency mechanism. This\nshould produce two populations of halo stars, one with high L/M ratios (light\nelements/metals), and the other with L/M ratios about ten times lower. The\nrelative weight of these two populations depends on the fraction of supernovae\nexploding inside superbubbles. In this context, we discuss the recent\nobservation of the B-depleted, Li-normal star HD 160617 (Primas, et al., 1998),\nas well as the reported spread in the Be data at [Fe/H] ~ -2.2 (Boesgaard, et\nal., 1999).

Our aim is to determine whether, if the disk is\ninitially tilted with respect to the plane of the binary orbit, the inclination\nof the system will increase or decrease with time. The problem is formulated in\nthe binary frame in which the tidal potential of the companion star is static.\nWe consider a steady, flat disk that is aligned with the binary plane and\ninvestigate its linear stability with respect to tilting or warping\nperturbations. The dynamics is controlled by the competing effects of the m=0\nand m=2 azimuthal Fourier components of the tidal potential. In the presence of\ndissipation, the m=0 component causes alignment of the system, while the m=2\ncomponent has the opposite tendency. We find that disks that are sufficiently\nlarge, in particular those that extend to their tidal truncation radii, are\ngenerally stable and will therefore tend to alignment with the binary plane on\na time-scale comparable to that found in previous studies. However, the effect\nof the m=2 component is enhanced in the vicinity of resonances where the outer\nradius of the disk is such that the natural frequency of a global bending mode\nof the disk is equal to twice the binary orbital frequency. Under such\ncircumstances, the disk can be unstable to tilting and acquire a warped shape,\neven in the absence of dissipation. The outer radius corresponding to the\nprimary resonance is always smaller than the tidal truncation radius. For disks\nsmaller than the primary resonance, the m=2 component may be able to cause a\nvery slow growth of inclination through the effect of a near resonance that\noccurs close to the disk center.

The presence of such an electron lowers the potential\nbarrier and increases the probability of tunneling by orders of magnitude.

The RXTE data provide the spectrum\nbeyond the ASCA range (0.5-10 keV) with significant detection of signals up to\n20keV and the upper limits above 20keV. The spectrum above 10keV is found to be\nvery flat. A strong iron-K emission line discovered in the previous ASCA\nobservation is also confirmed with the RXTE PCA. These results provide further\nevidence for the dominance of a reflection component, i.e. emission from cool\nmaterial illuminated by an AGN. By fitting the spectra obtained with RXTE and\nASCA simultaneously, we satisfactorily modeled the AGN spectrum with a Compton\nreflection component and probably a transmitted AGN component penetrating\nthrough a thick absorber. The X-ray luminosity of the AGN is estimated to be in\nthe range 4x10^43 - 6x10^44 ergs/s in the range 2-10keV, which categorizes\nNGC6240 among the most luminous Seyfert nuclei. The ratio of the 2-10keV X-ray\nluminosity to the infrared luminosity, L_X(2-10keV)/L_IR, is 0.01 - 0.1, which\nimplies a quite substantial, if not dominant, contribution of AGN to the\ninfrared luminosity.",

In particular, our analysis shows that dissociative (J-type) and\nnon-dissociative (C-type) shocks are simultaneously present everywhere along\nboth lobes of the flow. We confirm the low-excitation nature of the Herbig-Haro\nnebulosities, with shock velocities <40-50 km/s. Toward both lobes of the\noutflow we find pre-shock densities of n_0~10^4 cm-3 for both the J and C\ncomponents, implying B_0~100uG. In the central region of the flow, close to the\nexciting source, the pre-shock density deduced for the C-shock component is\nn_0~10^5 cm-3, suggesting a magnetic field ~3 times stronger. We propose that\nthe deficiency of gas-phase water in the post C-shock regions is due to\nfreezing onto warm grains processed through the J-shock front and traveling\nalong the magnetic field lines. The total observed cooling from the\ndissociative shock components is consistent with the power lost by a slow\nmolecular outflow accelerated by a fast neutral HI wind.\n  Finally, the skin of the cloud seen in projection toward the flow appears to\nbe weakly photo-ionised by BD +30 549, the dominant illuminating source of the\nNGC 1333 reflection nebula.",

In this review, we discuss both types of\napplications of chiral random matrix theory to the QCD partition function. We\nshow that constraints imposed by chiral symmetry and its spontaneous breaking\ndetermine the structure of low-energy effective partition functions for the\nDirac spectrum. We thus derive exact results for the low-lying eigenvalues of\nthe QCD Dirac operator. We argue that the statistical properties of these\neigenvalues are universal and can be described by a random matrix theory with\nthe global symmetries of the QCD partition function. The total number of such\neigenvalues increases with the square root of the Euclidean four-volume. The\nspectral density for larger eigenvalues (but still well below a typical\nhadronic mass scale) also follows from the same low-energy effective partition\nfunction. The validity of the random matrix approach has been confirmed by many\nlattice QCD simulations in a wide parameter range. Stimulated by the success of\nthe chiral random matrix theory in the description of universal properties of\nthe Dirac eigenvalues, the random matrix model is extended to nonzero\ntemperature and chemical potential. In this way we obtain qualitative results\nfor the QCD phase diagram and the spectrum of the QCD Dirac operator. We\ndiscuss the nature of the quenched approximation and analyze quenched Dirac\nspectra at nonzero baryon density in terms of an effective partition function.\nRelations with other fields are also discussed.",

    "summary": "Extracting the three dimensional power spectrum from the 2D distribution of\ngalaxies has become a standard tool of cosmology. This extraction requires some\nassumptions about the scaling of the power spectrum with redshift; all\ntreatments to date assume a simple power law scaling. In reality, different\nscales grow at different rates, due to non-linearities. We show that angular\nsurveys are sensitive to a weighted average of the power spectrum over a\ndistribution of redshifts, where the weight function varies with wavenumber. We\ncompute this weight function and show that it is fairly sharply peaked at\n\\bar{z}, which is a function of k. As long as the extracted power spectrum is\nunderstood to be $P(k,\\bar{z})$, the error introduced by non-linear scaling is\nquantifiable and small. We study these effects in the context of the APM and\nSDSS photometric surveys. In general the weight matrix is peaked at larger z\nand is broader for deeper surveys, leading to larger (but still quantifiable)\nerrors due to non-linear scaling. The tools introduced here -- in particular\nthe weight function and effective redshift $\\bar{z}$ -- can also be profitably\napplied to plan surveys to study the evolution of the power spectrum.",

Six of the objects are L-dwarfs, ranging in spectral class from L2 to\nL8/9, and the seventh is a methane or T-dwarf. These new observations were\nobtained during commissioning of NIRSPEC, the first high-resolution\nnear-infrared cryogenic spectrograph for the Keck II 10-meter telescope on\nMauna Kea, Hawaii. Spectra with a resolving power of R=2500 from 1.135 to 1.360\nmicrons (approximately J-band) are presented for each source. At this\nresolution, a rich spectral structure is revealed, much of which is due to\nblending of unresolved molecular transitions. Strong lines due to neutral\npotassium (K I), and bands due to iron hydride (FeH) and steam (H2O) change\nsignificantly throughout the L sequence. Iron hydride disappears between L5 and\nL8, the steam bands deepen and the K I lines gradually become weaker but wider\ndue to pressure broadening. An unidentified feature occurs at 1.22 microns\nwhich has a temperature dependence like FeH but has no counterpart in the\navailable FeH opacity data. Because these objects are 3-6 magnitudes brighter\nin the near-infrared compared to the I-band, spectral classification is\nefficient. One of the objects studied (2MASSW J1523+3014) is the coolest\nL-dwarf discovered so far by the 2-Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS), but its\nspectrum is still significantly different from the methane-dominated objects\nsuch as Gl229B or SDSS 1624+0029.",

For the case of the virtual gamma -> q-qbar\nphotoabsorption cross section, we investigate then in detail under which\nconditions the nuclear dependence encoded in the Furry wavefunctions can be\nparametrized by a q-qbar QCD dipole cross section. The important condition is\ncolour triviality, i.e., the property that for arbitrary N-fold rescattering\ncontributions the only non-vanishing colour trace is N_c C_F^N. We give proofs\nfor the colour triviality of the inelastic, diffractive and total\nphotoabsorption cross section measured inclusively or with one jet resolved in\nthe final state. Also, we list examples for which colour interference effects\nremain. Colour triviality allows us to write the gamma -> q qbar contribution\nto the DIS nuclear structure function F_2 for small Bjorken x in terms of a\npath integral which describes the transverse size evolution of the q-qbar pair\nin the nuclear colour field. This expression reduces in an opacity expansion to\nthe N=1 result of Nikolaev and Zakharov, and in the eikonal approximation to\nthe Glauber-type rescattering formulas first derived by Mueller. In the\nharmonic oscillator approximation of the path integral, we quantify deviations\nfrom the eikonal limit.

Using density-functional theory we find that\neven under conditions of high oxygen partial pressure, the metal terminated\nsurface is surprisingly stable. An oxygen terminated alpha-Al_2O_3 (0001)\nsurface becomes stable only if hydrogen is present on the surface. In addition,\nincluding hydrogen on the surface resolves discrepancies between previous\ntheoretical work and experimental results with respect to the magnitude and\ndirection of surface relaxations.",

In this Letter we offer such a theory for fractal\ngrowth patterns in two dimensions, including DLA as a particular case. In this\ntheory the fractal dimension of the asymptotic cluster manifests iteself as a\nrenormalization exponent observable already at very early growth stages. Using\nearly stage dynamics we compute 1.6896<D<1.7135, and explain why traditional\nnumerical estimates converged so slowly.

    "summary": "For describing the first-order isostructural valence phase transition in\nmixed valence compounds we develop a new approach based on the lattice Anderson\nmodel. We take into account the Coulomb interaction between localized f and\nconduction band electrons and two mechanisms of electron-lattice coupling. One\nis related to the volume dependence of the hybridization. The other is related\nto local deformations produced by f- shell size fluctuations accompanying\nvalence fluctuations. The large f -state degeneracy allows us to use the 1/N\nexpansion method. Within the model we develop a mean-field theory for the\nfirst-order valence phase transition in YbInCu_{4}. It is shown that the\nCoulomb interaction enhances the exchange interaction between f and conduction\nband electron spins and is the driving force of the phase transition. A\ncomparison between the theoretical calculations and experimental measurements\nof the valence change, susceptibility, specific heat, entropy, elastic\nconstants and volume change in YbInCu_{4} and YbAgCu_{4} are presented, and a\ngood quantitative agreement is found. On the basis of the model we describe the\nevolution from the first-order valence phase transition to the continuous\ntransition into the heavy-fermion ground state in the series of compounds\nYbIn_{1-x}Ag_{x}Cu_{4}. The effect of pressure on physical properties of\nYbInCu_{4} is studied and the H-T phase diagram is found.",

The method is a non-linear, maximum\n{\\it a posteriori} technique which can accommodate most aspects of the real\nradio occultation problem and is found to be stable and to converge rapidly in\nmost cases. The optimal estimation inverse method has two distinct advantages\nover the analytic inverse method in that it accounts for some of the effects of\nhorizontal gradients and is able to retrieve optimally temperature and humidity\nsimultaneously from the observations. It is also able to account for\nobservation noise and other sources of error. Combined, these advantages ensure\na realistic retrieval of atmospheric quantities.\n  A complete error analysis emerges naturally from the optimal estimation\ntheory, allowing a full characterisation of the solution. Using this analysis a\nquality control scheme is implemented which allows anomalous retrieval\nconditions to be recognised and removed, thus preventing gross retrieval\nerrors.\n  The inverse method presented in this paper has been implemented for bending\nangle measurements derived from GPS/MET radio occultation observations of the\nEarth. Preliminary results from simulated data suggest that these observations\nhave the potential to improve NWP model analyses significantly throughout their\nvertical range.",

The total area\ndecreases by domain growth and increases by nucleation of new small domains\ninside the larger ones. These two opposite variations are both hindered by\nstatic random fields (equivalent to energy barriers) due to the frozen dipoles\nborne by the off-center Li+ ions. Many results are well explained by a model\nwith a single energy barrier. However, some effects can only be understood if a\nbroad distribution of energy barriers is assumed.

We stress that it would be a sound test\nof the gravitational instability picture, independent on many systematic\neffects that may hamper lensing detection in CMB or galaxy survey alone.\nMoreover we estimate the intrinsic cosmic variance of the amplitude of this\neffect to be less than 8% for a 100, deg^2 survey with a 10' CMB beam. Its\nmeasurement would then provide us with an original mean for constraining the\ncosmological parameters, more particularly, as it turns out, the cosmological\nconstant Lambda.",

    "summary": "It has been shown by many independent studies that the cold dark matter\nscenario produces singular galactic dark halos, in strong contrast with\nobservations. Possible remedies are that either the dark matter is warm so that\nit has significant thermal motion or that the dark matter has strong self\ninteractions. We have combined these ideas to calculate the linear mass power\nspectrum and the spectrum of cosmic microwave background (CMB) fluctuations for\nself-interacting warm dark matter. Our results indicate that such models have\nmore power on small scales than is the case for the standard warm dark matter\nmodel, with a CMB fluctuation spectrum which is nearly indistinguishable from\nstandard cold dark matter. This enhanced small-scale power may provide better\nagreement with the observations than does standard warm dark matter.",

(1995). This is a sample of local\nstar-forming galaxies with redshift lower than 0.045, and they constitute a\nrepresentative subsample of the galaxies in the complete UCM survey. From the\nnew data, complemented with our own Gunn-r images and long-slit optical\nspectroscopy, we have measured integrated K-band luminosities, r-J and J-K\ncolours, and Halpha luminosities and equivalent widths. Using a maximum\nlikelihood estimator and a complete set of evolutionary synthesis models, these\nobservations have allowed us to estimate the strength of the current (or most\nrecent) burst of star formation, its age, the star-formation rate and the total\nstellar mass of the galaxies. An average galaxy in the sample has a stellar\nmass of 5E10 Msun and is undergoing (or recently completed) a burst of star\nformation involving about 2 per cent of its total stellar mass. We have\nidentified two separate classes of star-forming galaxies in the UCM sample: low\nluminosity, high excitation galaxies (HII-like) and relatively luminous spirals\ngalaxies (starburst disk-like). The former show higher specific star formation\nrates (SFR per unit mass) and burst strengths, and lower stellar masses than\nthe latter. With regard to their specific star formation rates, the UCM\ngalaxies are intermediate objects between normal quiescent spirals and the most\nextreme HII galaxies.",

Moreover, noise can suppress also the non-linear mechanism of\ninformation propagation, that may be present in the spatially extended system.\nA first example of phase transition is observed when both the linear and the\nnon-linear mechanisms of information production disappear at the same critical\nvalue of the noise amplitude. The corresponding critical properties can be\nhardly identified numerically, but some general argument suggests that they\ncould be ascribed to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class.

The efficiency depends on the black hole mass.\n  The new results are the dependence of the outburst recurrence time on the\nmass transfer rate from the companion star and the fraction of the matter which\nis accumulated in the disk for the outburst. We determine a lower limit of the\nmass transfer rate, below which no disk instability can be triggered.

The axis ratio and position angle of\nthe lens can be determined from the image positions of quadruple gravitational\nlensed systems by solving the lens equation semi-analytically, independent of\nthe radial profile. We give simple equations for estimating the power-law slope\nof the lens density directly from the image positions and for estimating the\ntime delay ratios.

    "summary": "We present Hubble Space Telescope WFPC2 images of a portion of the bright\nnortheast rim of NGC 6888, the nebular shell physically associated with the\nWolf-Rayet star HD 192163. The exposures are taken in the light of Halpha 6563,\n[O III] 5007, and [S II] 6717,6731. The images are used to constrain models of\nthe ionization structure of nebular features. From these models we infer\nphysical conditions within features, and estimate elemental abundances within\nthe nebula. The results of our analysis, together with the degree of small\nscale inhomogeneity apparent in the images, call into question the assumptions\nunderlying traditional methodologies for interpretation of nebular\nspectroscopy.\n  The thermal pressure of photoionized clumps is higher than the inferred\ninternal pressure of the shocked stellar wind, implying that the current\nphysical conditions have changed significantly over less than a few thousand\nyears. These results are discussed within the context of published three-wind\nevolutionary scenarios for the formation of the nebula. We also discuss the\nnature of a back-illuminated radiative shock driven into the cavity surrounding\nNGC 6888.",

We begin with a brief discussion of the\neffects of thermal fluctuations on the spontaneously broken U(1) and\ntranslation symmetries, on the global phase diagram and on the critical\nbehaviour. Introducing disorder we restrict ourselves to the experimentally\nmost relevant case of weak uncorrelated randomness which is known to destroy\nthe long-ranged translational order of the Abrikosov lattice in three\ndimensions. Elucidating possible residual glassy ordered phases, we distinguish\nbetwee positional and phase-coherent vortex glasses. The discussion of elastic\nvortex glasses, in two and three dimensions occupy the main part of our review.\nIn particular, in three dimensions there exists an elastic vortex-glass phase\nwhich still shows quasi-long-range translational order: the `Bragg glass'. It\nis shown that this phase is stable with respect to the formation of\ndislocations for intermediate fields. Preliminary results suggest that the\nBragg-glass phase may not show phase-coherent vortex-glass order. The latter is\nexpected to occur in systems with weak disorder only in higher dimensions. We\nfurther demonstrate that the linear resistivity vanishes in the vortex-glass\nphase. The vortex-glass transition is studied in detail for a superconducting\nfilm in a parallel field. Finally, we review some recent developments\nconcerning driven vortex-line lattices moving in a random environment.",

Analyzing the model\nincluding both interactions by the combination of the mean-field approximation\nand the exact diagonalization method, it is argued that the spin-charge-orbital\nstructure in the insulating phase of the purely JT-phononic model is not\nqualitatively changed by the inclusion of the Coulomb interactions. As an\nimportant application of the present mean-field approximation, the CE-type AFM\nstate, the charge-stacked structure along the z-axis, and the\n(3x^2-r^2)/(3y^2-r^2)-type orbital ordering are successfully reproduced based\non the JT-phononic model for the half-doped manganite. Topological arguments\nand the relevance of the Heisenberg exchange among localized t_{\\rm 2g} spins\nexplains why the nearest-neighbor Coulomb interaction does not destroy the\ncharge stacking structure. It is also verified that the phase-separation\ntendency is observed both in purely JT-phononic and purely Coulombic models in\nthe vicinity of the hole undoped region, as long as realistic hopping matrices\nare used. This highlights the qualitative similarities of both approaches, and\nthe relevance of mixed-phase tendencies in the context of manganites. In\naddition, the rich and complex phase diagram of the two-orbital Coulombic model\nin one dimension is presented. Our results provide robust evidence that\nCoulombic and JT-phononic approaches to manganites are not qualitatively\ndifferent ways to carry out theoretical calculations, but they share a variety\nof common features.",

This means\nthat the radiation from the HINER has the anisotropic property and thus\nstatistical properties of the HINER emission can be used to investigate the\nviewing angle toward dusty tori for various types of Seyfert nuclei. In order\nto investigate viewing angles toward various types of Seyferys, we apply this\nHINER test to them.\n  Our main results are as follows. (1) The NLS1s are viewed from a more face-on\nview toward dusty tori than the S2s. However, the HINER properties of the NLS1s\nare indistinguishable from those of the S1s. (2) The type 1.5 Seyferts appear\nto comprise heterogeneous populations. (3) The type 1.8 and 1.9 Seyferts and\nthe objects showing either a broad Pa_beta line or polarized broad Balmer lines\nare seen from a large inclination angle and the emission from the BLRs of such\nobjects reaches us through optically-thin parts of dusty tori. These three\nresults support strongly the current unified model of Seyfert nuclei. And, (4)\nthe line ratios of [Fe X]6374 to the low-ionization emission-lines have rather\nisotropic property than those of [Fe VII]6087. Therefore it is suggested that\nthe [Fe X] emission is not useful investigating the viewing angle toward the\ndusty torus in Seyfert nuclei.

Further,\nspectral quality is too poor to classify other three galaxies. Therefore, we\ndescribe our results for the remaining 63 galaxies.\n  Our main results are summarized below.

(2) Comparing the frequency\ndistributions of activity types between the HCGs and the field galaxies whose\ndata are taken from Ho, Filippenko, & Sargent (382 field galaxies), we find\nthat the frequency of HII nuclei in the HCGs is significantly less than that in\nthe field. However, this difference may be due to selection bias that our HCG\nsample contains more early-type galaxies than the field, because it is known\nthat HII nuclei are rarer in early-type galaxies than in later ones. (3)\nApplying correction this morphological bias to the HCG sample, we find that\nthere is no statistically significant difference in the frequency of occurrence\nof emission-line galaxies between the HCGs and the field. This implies that the\ndense galaxy environment in the HCGs does not affect triggering both the AGN\nactivity and the nuclear starburst.

The plasma\nrequires at least two temperature components: a silicon-dominated cool plasma\nof 0.6keV temperature and a sulfur-dominated higher temperature plasma of\n4.4keV. Because the absorption column is ~ 6x10^22 H cm^-2, this SNR would be\nnear to the GC.

The solutions are obtained by solving numerically a set\nof ordinary differential equations corresponding to a steady axisymmetric\ngeometrically thin disk. We pay special attention to consistently satisfy the\nregularity conditions at singular points of the equations. For this reason we\nanalytically expand a solution at the singular point, and use coefficients of\nthe expansion in our iterative numerical procedure. We obtain consistent\ntransonic solutions in a wide range of values of the viscosity parameter alpha\nand mass acretion rate. We compare two different form of viscosity: one takes\nthe shear stress to be proportional to the pressure, while the other uses the\nangular velocity gradient-dependent stress.\n  We find that there are two singular points in solutions corresponding to the\npressure-proportional shear stress. The inner singular point locates close to\nthe last stable orbit around black hole. This point changes its type from a\nsaddle to node depending on values of alpha and accretion rate. The outer\nsingular point locates at larger radius and is always of a saddle-type. We\nargue that, contrary to the previous investigations, a nodal-type inner\nsingular point does not introduce multiple solutions. Only one integral curve,\nwhich corresponds to the unique global solution, passes simultaneously the\ninner and outer singular points independently of the type of inner singular\npoint. Solutions with the angular velocity gradient-dependent shear stress have\none singular point which is always of a saddle-type and corresponds to the\nunique global solution. The structure of accretion disks corresponding to both\nviscosities are similar.",

    "summary": "The conceptional design of the proposed linear electron-positron collider\nTESLA is based on 9-cell 1.3 GHz superconducting niobium cavities with an\naccelerating gradient of Eacc >= 25 MV/m at a quality factor Q0 > 5E+9. The\ndesign goal for the cavities of the TESLA Test Facility (TTF) linac was set to\nthe more moderate value of Eacc >= 15 MV/m. In a first series of 27\nindustrially produced TTF cavities the average gradient at Q0 = 5E+9 was\nmeasured to be 20.1 +- 6.2 MV/m, excluding a few cavities suffering from\nserious fabrication or material defects. In the second production of 24 TTF\ncavities additional quality control measures were introduced, in particular an\neddy-current scan to eliminate niobium sheets with foreign material inclusions\nand stringent prescriptions for carrying out the electron-beam welds. The\naverage gradient of these cavities at Q0 = 5E+9 amounts to 25.0 +- 3.2 MV/m\nwith the exception of one cavity suffering from a weld defect. Hence only a\nmoderate improvement in production and preparation techniques will be needed to\nmeet the ambitious TESLA goal with an adequate safety margin. In this paper we\npresent a detailed description of the design, fabrication and preparation of\nthe TESLA Test Facility cavities and their associated components and report on\ncavity performance in test cryostats and with electron beam in the TTF linac.\nThe ongoing R&D towards higher gradients is briefly addressed.",

    "summary": "The separation $\\del$ between two peaks in the gamma-ray pulse profile is\ncalculated as a function of energy for several polar cap models with\ncurvature-radiation-induced cascades. The Monte Carlo results are interpreted\nwith the help of analytical approximations and discussed in view of the recent\ndata analysis for the Vela pulsar (Kanbach 1999). We find that the behaviour of\n$\\del$ as a function of photon energy $\\epsilon$ depends primarily on local\nvalues of the magnetic field, $B_{\\rm local}$, in the region where\nelectromagnetic cascades develop. For low values of $B_{\\rm local}$ ($<\n10^{12}$ G), $\\del(\\epsilon)$ is kept constant. However, for stronger magnetic\nfields ($\\ga 10^{12}$ G) in the hollow-column model $\\del$ decreases with\nincreasing photon energy at a rate dependent on maximum energy of beam\nparticles as well as on viewing geometry. There exists a critical photon energy\n$\\et$ above which the relation $\\del(\\epsilon)$ changes drastically: for\n$\\epsilon > \\et$, in hollow-column models the separation $\\del$ increases\n(whereas in filled-column model it decreases) rapidly with increasing\n$\\epsilon$, at a rate of $\\sim 0.28$ of the total phase per decade of photon\nenergy. The existence of critical energy $\\et$ is a direct consequence of\none-photon magnetic absorption effects. In general, $\\et$ is located close to\nthe high-energy cutoff of the spectrum, thus photon statistics at $\\et$ should\nbe very low. That will make difficult to verify the existence of $\\et$ in real\ngamma-ray pulsars. Spectral properties of the Vela pulsar would favour those\nmodels which use low values of magnetic field in the emission region ($B_{\\rm\nlocal} \\simless 10^{11}$ G) which in turn implies a constant value of the\npredicted $\\del$ within EGRET range.",

    "summary": "We present results from a spatially resolved spectral analysis of the merging\ncluster Abell 2256. The long integration time (135 ks) and the good spatial\nresolution of the MECS onboard BeppoSAX allow us to derive a new and\nsubstantially improved measurement of the temperature structure. We find that,\nwithin a central region of the cluster, where the effects of the merger are\nvisible in the ROSAT surface brightness image, the azimuthally averaged\nprojected temperature is remarkably flat; outside this region the projected\ntemperature rapidly declines. The BeppoSAX data also shows clear evidence of an\nazimuthal temperature gradient in the 4'-8' (0.4-0.8 Mpc) radial bin, oriented\nin the same direction as the merger itself. Our metal abundance profile shows,\nfor the first time, firm evidence of an abundance gradient in a rich merging\ncluster. Intriguingly the abundance map shows, in the SE sector, i.e. the one\nfurthest away from the merger, a sharp factor of two drop in abundance at a\nradius comparable to the core radius of the cluster. A possible interpretation\nis that, prior to the merger event, a cooling flow had already developed in the\ncore of the infalling subgroup, as suggested by Fabian and Daines (1991). The\ninteraction between the substructures would have disrupted the cooling flow\nthereby re-heating and re-mixing the gas. As the merger in A2256 is still in a\nrelatively early stage, the gas located on the side opposite to the merger\nevent would still retain the low abundances associated with the intra-cluster\nmedium (ICM) prior to the cooling flow disruption.",

If an added rule is inconsistent with a program, that is,\nif it leads to a situation such that no stable model exists for a new program,\nthen deletion and addition of rules are performed to avoid inconsistency. We\nspecify a revision by translating a normal logic program into an abductive\nlogic program with abducibles to represent deletion and addition of rules. To\ncompute such deletion and addition, we propose an adaptation of our top-down\nabductive proof procedure to compute a relevant abducibles to an added rule. We\ncompute a minimally revised program, by choosing a minimal set of abducibles\namong all the sets of abducibles computed by a top-down proof procedure.",

    "summary": "In this study we present two indicators that will reflect the difference\nbetween collapsars and normal collapse-driven supernovae. They are products of\nexplosive nucleosynthesis and neutrino emission. In the collapsar model, it is\nnatural to consider that the product of explosive nucleosynthesis depends on\nthe zenith angle because the system becomes highly asymmetric in order to\ngenerate a fire ball. We also consider the detectability of the HNRs which is\nlocated nearby our Galaxy. As a result, the number of the HNRs is estimated to\nbe 5 $\\times$ ($10^2$ -- $10^{-3}$), whose chemical composition can be\nspatially resolved. Using the optimistic estimate, more HNRs will be found and\nit will be possible to discuss on the chemical composition statistically. As\nfor the energy spectrums of neutrinos, they are not thermalized in a collapsar\nbecause the density of the accretion disk is much lower than that of a neutron\nstar. The energy spectrums of (anti-)electron neutrinos from hypernovae will be\nmainly determined by the process of electron (positron) capture on free proton\n(neutron). It is also noted that high energy tail is not dumped in the case of\nhypernovae because the density of emitting region is low. Total energy of\nneutrino from hypernovae will depend on a lot of physical parameters such as\ntotal accreting mass and mass accretion rate, which are quite contrary to the\nsituation of the normal collapse-driven supernovae. Therefore there will be a\nlarge variety of total neutrino's energies among collapsars. In the case of SN\n1998bw, we think that the matter around the equatorial plane might be ejected\nfrom the system, which resulted in the formation of relatively weak jets and\nfaint GRB 980425.",

The evolutionary state and the\nmassive stellar content of the region is derived in a self-consistent way.\n  The three techniques applied suggest that the central ionizing cluster in NGC\n604 is very young, 3 Myr old, and that the stars in the cluster were formed in\nan instantaneous burst following a Salpeter or flatter IMF, having stars more\nmassive that 80 Msol. The stellar cluster is able to provide most of the\nionizing photons needed to photoionize the whole nebula, and the wind power to\nform the central shell structure where the cluster core is located. The stellar\ncluster is affected by an extinction similar to the average extinction that\naffects the ionized gas.

The spectrum exhibits a broad absorption feature\ncentered at 7700\\AA, which we interpret as the K~I 7665/7699 resonance doublet.\nThe observed flux declines shortward of 7000\\AA, due most likely to the red\nwing of the Na~I doublet. Both Cs~I doublet lines are detected more strongly\nthan in an earlier red spectrum. Neither Li~I absorption nor H$\\alpha$ emission\nare detected. An exploratory model fit to the spectrum suggests that the shape\nof the red spectrum can be primarily accounted for by the broad wings of the\nK~I and Na~I doublets. This behavior is consistent with the argument proffered\nby Burrows, Marley and Sharp that strong alkali absorption is principally\nresponsible for depressing T dwarf spectra shortward of 1$\\mu$m. In particular,\nthere seems no compelling reason at this time to introduce dust or an\nadditional opacity source in the atmosphere of the SDSS object.

    "summary": "We propose a model in which ultra high energy cosmic rays are produced by\ncollisions between neutron stars and axion stars. The acceleration of such a\ncosmic ray is made by the electric field, $\\sim 10^{15} (B/10^{12} {G}) {eV}\n{cm}^{-1}$, which is induced in an axion star by the strong magnetic field\n$B>10^{12}$ G of a neutron star. As we have shown previously, similar\ncollisions generate gamma ray bursts when the magnetic field is much smaller,\ne.g. $\\sim 10^{10}$ G. If we assume that the axion mass is $\\sim 10^{-9}$ eV,\nwe can explain huge energies of the gamma ray bursts $\\sim 10^{54}$ erg as well\nas the ultra high energies of the cosmic rays $\\sim 10^{20}$ eV. In addition,\nit turns out that these axion stars are plausible candidates for MACHOs. We\npoint out a possibility of observing monochromatic radiations emitted from the\naxion stars.",

The algebra is shown to\nbe invariant under a linear twist of the generators, except for a unique value\nof the continuous twist parameter. At this value, the invariance is broken and\nthe algebra collapses to the small N=4 superconformal algebra. In the context\nof string theory, the asymmetric N=4 superconformal algebra is provided with an\nexplicit construction on the boundary of AdS_3, and is induced by an affine\nSL(2|2) current superalgebra residing on the world sheet. Substituting the\nworld sheet SL(2|2) by the coset SL(2|2)/U(1) results in the small N=4\nsuperconformal algebra on the boundary of AdS_3.",

These\nmissions will require a careful optimisation of their observational systems in\norder to maximise their scientific return, and will require reliable and\nautomated techniques for parametrizing the very large number of stars detected.\nTo address these two problems, I investigate the precision to which the three\nprincipal stellar parameters (Teff, logg, [M/H]) can be determined as a\nfunction of spectral resolution and signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio, using a large\ngrid of synthetic spectra. The parametrization technique is a neural network,\nwhich is shown to provide an accurate three-dimensional physical\nparametrization of stellar spectra across a wide range of parameters. It is\nfound that even at low resolution (50-100 AA FWHM) and SNR (5-10 per resolution\nelement), Teff and \\met can be determined to 1% and 0.2 dex respectively across\na large range of temperatures (4000-30000 K) and metallicities (-3.0 to +1.0\ndex), and that logg is measurable to +/- 0.2 dex for stars earlier than solar.\nThe accuracy of the results is probably limited by the finite parameter\nsampling of the data grid. The ability of medium band filter systems (with\n10-15 filters) for determining stellar parameters is also investigated.\nAlthough easier to implement in a unpointed survey, it is found that they are\nonly competitive at higher SNRs (> 50).",

The strategy\nrelies on a combination of in-beam phase-referencing, wide-field VLBI imaging\nand simultaneous correlation of multiple field centres. A combination of these\ntechniques, together with the steeply rising radio source counts observed at cm\nwavelengths, permit routine high resolution observations of radio sources\npreviously considered too faint for conventional VLBI.",

There is some evidence from earlier studies that\nthese two sources exhibit low frequency (<1 GHz) variability. This work shows\nthat both sources have linear polarizations, if any, below the detection limits\nat 320 MHz, so we cannot explain the variability as being due to instrumental\npolarization effects as has been suggested for 3C159. Refractive scintillation\nmay be the cause of the variability in 0235-197. This would require the\nexistence of a bright, compact component in one of the hot spots seen in these\nobservations. This is not implausible but the resolution of this observational\nprogram is insufficent to address that question. The radio source 1203+043\nlacks any bright compact component thereby ruling out a refractive\nscintillation mechanism for its variability. Consequently, it is possible that\nclaims of variability in this source are spurious. However, the 320 MHz VLA\nobservations show that 1203+043 has an `X'-shaped radio structure. This is a\nrare morphology for the brightness distribution of a radio galaxy; the\nimplications of this are examined.",

When the couplings are fine tuned in a certain way,\nthe spin and charge degrees of freedom, corresponding to the supercurrent\nalgebras su(2) and osp(2|2) respectively, decouple in the renormalization group\nflow. The infrared fixed point of this simpler theory is the coset\nosp(4|4)/su(2) which is closely related to the current algebra osp(2|2) but not\nidentical.

We find a correlation between the SiO\nmorphology and the spatial distribution of the Fe 6.4 keV line, on the large\nscale and also within Sgr A and Sgr B. The SiO abundance increases by a factor\nof 20 in the regions with strong Fe 6.4 keV line. This indicates that the Fe\n6.4 keV line mainly arises from molecular clouds with large gas phase abundance\nof refractory elements. We discuss the implications of the correlation on the\norigin of the hard X-rays, and the heating and the chemistry of the molecular\nclouds in the GC",

It is argued that\nonly non-renormalized structures in correlation functions can be changed by\nsuch a field transformation, and that the study of the response of correlation\nfunctions to gravity field transformations allows one to find them. In the case\nof 4-point functions of CPOs in SYM_4 several non-renormalized structures are\nfound, including the extremal and subextremal ones. It is also checked that\nquartic couplings of scalar fields s^I that are dual to extended chiral primary\noperators vanish in the subextremal case, as dictated by the\nnon-renormalization theorem for the subextremal 4-point functions and the\nAdS/CFT correspondence.",

    "summary": "Non-perturbative production of fermions after chaotic inflation has been the\nobject of several studies in the very recent past. However, the results in the\nmost interesting case of production of massive fermions in an expanding\nUniverse were so far known only numerically. We provide very simple and\nreadable analytical formulae, both for the spectra of the created fermions and\nfor their total energy density. Their derivation is closely related to the one\nadopted for bosons and exploits the fact that the production occurs during very\nshort intervals of nonadiabatical change of the fermionic frequency. Our\nformulae show the presence of resonance bands if the expansion of the Universe\nis neglected, and their disappearance when the latter is included. As in the\nbosonic case, this last effect is due to the stochastic character that the\nexpansion gives to the whole process. Backreaction is considered in the last\npart of the work. All our analytical results are in excellent agreement with\nthe previous numerical ones in the regime of validity of the latter. However, a\nmore accurate scaling for the energy density of the produced fermions is here\nfound.",

We show that the competition between Kondo\neffect and RKKY interaction can be expressed in Hamiltonian form and the\ndilution effect due to alloying leads to a quantum percolation problem driven\nby the number of magnetically compensated moments. We argue that the exhaustion\nparadox proposed by Nozi\\`eres is explained when the RKKY interaction is taken\ninto account. We revisited the one impurity and two impurity Kondo problem and\nshowed that in the presence of particle-hole symmetry breaking operators the\nsystem flows to a line of fixed points characterized by coherent motion of the\nspins. This leads to a {\\it cluster Kondo effect}. We calculate explicitly from\nthe microscopic Hamiltonian the parameters which appear in all the response\nfunctions. We show that there is a maximum number $N_c$ of spins in the\nclusters such that above this number tunneling ceases to occur. These effects\nlead to a distribution of cluster Kondo temperatures which vanishes for finite\nclusters and therefore leads to strong magnetic response. From these results we\npropose a {\\it dissipative quantum droplet model} which describes the critical\nbehavior of metallic magnetic systems. This model predicts that in the\nparamagnetic phase there is a crossover temperature $T^*$ above which\nGriffiths-McCoy like singularities with power law behavior. Below $T^*$,\nhowever, a new regime dominated by dissipation occurs with stronger\ndivergences. We estimate that $T^*$ is exponentially small with $N_c$.",

Data reduction leaves 62 quasars, 35\nradio-loud and 27 radio-quiet, suitable for spectral analysis. Differences are\nfound between the radio-quiet quasars (RQQs) and the radio-loud quasars (RLQs),\nin agreement with previous studies. A correlation between Gamma and optical\nH-beta was also found for the radio-quiet quasars in this sample, whereby the\nsteepest X-ray spectra tend to be found in those objects with narrow H-beta\nwidths. The correlation is significant at >99% confidence, confirming the\nwell-known trend between Gamma and H-beta FWHM in Seyfert 1s (Brandt et al.\n1997), but at higher luminosities. Other spectral complexities are observed\nfrom this sample. A soft X-ray excess, with blackbody temperatures in the range\n100 - 300 eV, is seen in many low z radio-quiet quasars. In most cases the\ntemperatures are probably too hot to originate directly from the disk. Iron K\nline emission features are also found in the RQQs; but often from partially\nionised material. Indeed in the highest luminosity RQQs there is neither\nevidence for iron line emission nor the reflection component expected from disk\nmodels. These observations can be explained by an increase in the quasar\naccretion rate with luminosity, leading to an increase in the ionisation state\nof the surface layers of the disk. The occurrence of ionised or `warm'\nabsorbers is rare in this sample, with only 5 detections. However excess\nneutral X-ray absorption is found towards several of the high z, predominantly\nradio-loud, quasars. Although found to increase with quasar redshift, this\n`intrinsic' absorption may be associated with radio-loud AGN.",

By introducing a\n``relativistic'' conserved energy-momentum tensor, we derive quasi-equilibrium\nstates of the fluid across the ``Landau'' quasiparticle horizon at temperatures\nwell above the quantum Hawking temperature. Nonlinear dispersion of the\nquasiparticle energy spectrum is instrumental for quasiparticle communication\nand exchange across the horizon. It is responsible for the establishment of the\nlocal thermal equilibrium across the horizon with the Tolman temperature being\ninhomogeneous behind the horizon. The inhomogeneity causes relaxation of the\nquasi-equilibrium states due to scattering of thermal quasiparticles, which\nfinally leads to a shrinking black hole horizon. This process serves as the\nclassical thermal counterpart of the quantum effect of Hawking radiation and\nwill allow for an observation of the properties of the horizon at temperatures\nwell above the Hawking temperature. We discuss the thermal entropy related to\nthe horizon. We find that only the first nonlinear correction to the energy\nspectrum is important for the thermal properties of the horizon. They are fully\ndetermined by an energy of order $E_{\\rm Planck}(T/E_{\\rm Planck})^{1/3}$,\nwhich is well below the Planck energy scale $E_{\\rm Planck}$, so that Planck\nscale physics is not involved in determining thermal quantities related to the\nhorizon.",

It is found that the order of the\nphase transition to a kaon-condensed phase, and whether or not Gibbs' rules for\nphase equilibrium can be satisfied in the case of a first order transition,\ndepend sensitively on the choice of the kaon-nucleon interaction. The main\neffect of finite temperature, for any value of the lepton fraction, is to mute\nthe effects of a first order transition, so that the thermodynamics becomes\nsimilar to that of a second order transition. Above a critical temperature,\nfound to be at least 30--60 MeV depending upon the interaction, the first order\ntransition disappears. The phase boundaries in baryon density versus lepton\nnumber and baryon density versus temperature planes are delineated. We find\nthat the thermal effects on the maximum gravitational mass of neutron stars are\nas important as the effects of trapped neutrinos, in contrast to previously\nstudied cases in which the matter contained only nucleons or in which hyperons\nand/or quark matter were considered. Kaon-condensed EOSs permit the existence\nof metastable neutron stars, because the maximum mass of an initially hot,\nlepton-rich protoneutron star is greater than that of a cold, deleptonized\nneutron star. The large thermal effects imply that a metastable protoneutron\nstar's collapse to a black hole could occur much later than in previously\nstudied cases that allow metastable configurations.",

The spin excitation spectrum as well as the thermodynamic\nquantities are computed by means of the Schwinger-boson mean-field theory. We\ndiscuss how the magnetic double structure with the gapful and the gapless\nexcitations is generated, and apply the results systematically to the Haldane\ngap system in a staggered magnetic field and also to the weakly coupled\nferrimagnetic mixed-spin chains.

We perform a factorization with a simple technique in\norder to consistently separate perturbative from non-perturbative effects. We\nfind that the shape function, contrary to naive expectations,is not a physical\ndistribution, as it is affected by substantial regularization scheme effects,\ncontrolling even the leading, double-logarithmic term.

In this Letter, we focus on some\nstatistical properties of these counts which are fundamental in order to\ncharacterize the large scale correlations in the galaxy spatial distribution.\nThere are, in fact, no longer doubts since two decades of the existence of very\nlarge scale structures. The still remaining problem concerns the correct\ncharacterization of their statistical properties. We propose to study two\nproperties of galaxy counts data, in order to discriminate between a small\nscale (~ 5 - 20 Mpc/h) homogeneous distribution, and a fractal structure on\nlarge scales (~ 20 - 300 Mpc/h). Firstly, the average slope of the counts which\ncan be associated to an eventual fractal dimension in real space by simple\narguments. Secondly, we propose to study fluctuations of counts around the\naverage behavior as a function of apparent magnitude in the whole magnitude\nrange B_j > 11. These fluctuations can discriminate between a genuine fractal\ndistribution and a homogeneous one. In fact, they are related to the very\nstatistical properties of the spatial distribution, independently on\ncosmological corrections. More specifically, in a fractal distribution one\nexpects to find persistent scale-invariant fluctuations around the average\nbehavior, which do not decay with apparent magnitude. On the other hand, in an\nhomogeneous distribution, on large enough scales, the relative variance of the\ncounts should decrease exponentially with apparent magnitude. Smooth\ncosmological corrections cannot change such a behavior.",

    "summary": "We investigate the noncommutative analogue of the spontaneously broken linear\nsigma model at the one-loop quantum level. In the commutative case,\nrenormalization of a theory with a spontaneously broken continuous global\nsymmetry depends on cancellations that enable the limited set of counterterms\nconsistent with that symmetry to remove the divergences even after its\nspontaneous breaking, while preserving the masslessness of the associated\nGoldstone modes. In the noncommutative case, we find that these cancellations\nare violated, and the renormalized one-loop correction to the inverse pion\npropagator explicitly yields a mass shift which depends on the ultraviolet\ncutoff. Thus, we cannot naively take the ultraviolet cutoff to infinity first,\nand then take the external momentum to zero to verify Nambu-Goldstone symmetry\nrealization. However, from the Wilsonian perspective where the cutoff is fixed\nand physical, the zero external momentum limit of the inverse pion propagator\nstill vanishes, and implies the masslessness of the pion fields at one-loop.\nThis is another demonstration of the failure of ultraviolet and infrared limits\nto commute in noncommutative field theories, and signals the incompatibility of\nNambu-Goldstone symmetry realization with the continuum renormalization of\nthese theories.",

    "summary": "Examining the nature of the relative clustering of different galaxy types can\nhelp tell us how galaxies formed. To measure this relative clustering, I\nperform a joint counts-in-cells analysis of galaxies of different spectral\ntypes in the Las Campanas Redshift Survey (LCRS). I develop a\nmaximum-likelihood technique to fit for the relationship between the density\nfields of early- and late-type galaxies. This technique can directly measure\nnonlinearity and stochasticity in the biasing relation. At high significance, a\nsmall amount of stochasticity is measured, corresponding to a correlation\ncoefficient of about 0.87 on scales corresponding to 15 Mpc/h spheres. A large\nproportion of this signal appears to derive from errors in the selection\nfunction, and a more realistic estimate finds a correlation coefficient of\nabout 0.95. These selection function errors probably account for the large\nstochasticity measured by Tegmark & Bromley (1999), and may have affected\nmeasurements of very large-scale structure in the LCRS. Analysis of the data\nand of mock catalogs shows that the peculiar geometry, variable flux limits,\nand central surface-brightness selection effects of the LCRS do not seem to\ncause the effect.",

We first present a\nreview of the literature, including the issues of unification, renormalization\ngroup evolution of the supersymmetry breaking parameters and the effect of\nradiative corrections on the effective low energy couplings and masses of the\ntheory. We consider the experimental bounds coming from direct searches and\nthose arising indirectly from precision data, cosmology and the requirement of\nvacuum stability. The issues of flavor and CP-violation are also addressed. The\nmain subject of this study is to update sparticle production cross sections,\nmake improved estimates of backgrounds, delineate the discovery reach in the\nsupergravity framework, and examine how this might vary when assumptions about\nuniversality of soft breaking parameters are relaxed. With 30 fb$^{-1}$\nluminosity and one detector, charginos and neutralinos, as well as third\ngeneration squarks, can be seen if their masses are not larger than 200-250\nGeV, while first and second generation squarks and gluinos can be discovered if\ntheir masses do not significantly exceed 400 GeV.

We find that the bursts divide naturally into two\npopulations: ``fast bursts'' occur on the Banana Branch when the accretion rate\nis high and exhibit short decay times, high peak fluxes, and radius expansion\nepisodes. ``Slow bursts'' occur in the Island State at lower accretion rates,\nhave lower peak fluxes, higher fluences, longer decay times, and show no\nevidence of radius expansion. All five of the fast bursts, and none of the four\nslow bursts, show coherent oscillations near 524 Hz.\n  We perform in-burst phase connection of the burst pulsations, which allows us\nto unambiguously characterize their frequency evolution. That evolution\nexhibits a variety of behaviors, including a sharp spin-down during one burst.\nApplying our phase models, we find that the pulsations are spectrally harder\nthan the burst emission, with the strength of the pulsations increasing\nmonotonically with photon energy. Coherently summing all of the burst signals,\nwe find upper limits of ~5% relative to the strength of the main pulse on any\nmodulation at 1/2 or 3/2 the main pulse frequency.

Other approaches for\nstating security policies fall short of what is desirable with respect to\neither policy clarity, executability, or the precision with which a policy may\nbe expressed. However, LaSCO is designed to have those three desirable\nproperties of a security policy language as well as: relevance for many\ndifferent systems, statement of policies at an appropriate level of detail,\nuser friendliness for both casual and expert users, and amenability to formal\nreasoning. In LaSCO, the constraints of a policy are stated as directed graphs\nannotated with expressions describing the situation under which the policy\napplies and what the requirement is. LaSCO may be used for such diverse\napplications as executing programs, file systems, operating systems,\ndistributed systems, and networks.\n  Formal operational semantics have been defined for LaSCO. An architecture for\nimplementing LaSCO on any system, is presented along with an implementation of\nthe system-independent portion in Perl. Using this, we have implemented LaSCO\nfor Java programs, preventing Java programs from violating policy. A GUI to\nfacilitate writing policies is provided. We have studied applying LaSCO to a\nnetwork as viewed by GrIDS, a distributed intrusion detection system for large\nnetworks, and propose a design. We conclude that LaSCO has characteristics that\nenable its use on different types of systems throughout the process of\nprecisely expressing a policy, understanding the implications of a policy, and\nimplementing it on a system.",

    "summary": "We calculate the partonic structure of constituent quark in the\nNext-to-Leading Order for the first time. The structure of any hadron can be\nobtained thereafter using a convolution method. Such a procedure is used to\ngenerate the structure function of proton and pion in NLO. It is shown that\nwhile the constituent quark structure is generated purely perturbatively and\naccounts to most part of the hadronic structure, there is a few percent\ncontributions coming from the nonperturbative sector in the hadronic structure.\nThis contribution plays the key role in explaining the SU(2) symmetry breaking\nof the nucleon sea and the observed violation of Gottfried sum rule. These\neffects are calculated. Excellent agreement with data in a wide range of\n$x=[10^{-6}, 1]$ and $Q^{2}=[0.5, 5000]$ $GeV^{2}$ is reached for proton\nstructure function. We have also calculated Pion structure and compared it with\nthe existing data. Again nice agreement is achieved.",

We pay\nparticular attention to electron collision and radiative transfer as well as\nunderlying stellar absorption effects which may make the He I emission lines\ndeviate from their recombination values. Using a large homogeneous sample of 45\nlow-metallicity H II regions in BCGs, and extrapolating the Y-O/H and Y-N/H\nlinear regressions to O/H = N/H = 0, we obtain Yp = 0.2443+/-0.0015, in\nexcellent agreement with the weighted mean value Yp = 0.2452+/-0.0015 obtained\nfrom the detailed analysis of the two most metal-deficient BCGs known, I Zw 18\nand SBS 0335-052.

    "summary": "The method of asymptotic expansions is used to build an approximation scheme\nrelevant to celestial mechanics in relativistic theories of gravitation. A\nscalar theory is considered, both as a simple example and for its own sake.\nThis theory is summarized, then the relevant boundary problem is seen to be the\nfull initial-value problem. It is shown that, with any given system of\ngravitating bodies, one may associate a one-parameter family of similar\nsystems, the parameter measuring the gravitational field-strength. After a\nspecific change of units, the derivation of asymptotic expansions becomes\nstraightforward. Two hypotheses could be made as to which time variable has to\nbe used in the expansion. The first one leads to an \"asymptotic\" post-Newtonian\napproximation (PNA) with instantaneous propagation, differing from the standard\nPNA in that, in the asymptotic PNA, all fields are expanded. The second\nhypothese could lead to an \"asymptotic\" post-Minkowskian approximation (PMA)\nallowing to describe propagation effects, but it is not compatible with the\nNewtonian limit. It is shown that the standard PNA is not compatible with the\napplication of the usual method of asymptotic expansions as envisaged here.",

We find that the SMA solution gives the\nbest fit to the total rates data from the different experiments. One new\nfeature of our analysis is the use of the moments of the SK electron spectrum\nin a $\\chi^2$ analysis. The best-fit to the moments is broadly in agreement\nwith that obtained from a direct fit to the spectrum data and prefers a $\\Delta\nm^2$ comparable to the SMA fit to the rates but the required mixing angle is\nlarger. In the combined rate and spectrum analysis, apart from varying the\nnormalization of the $^8$B flux as a free parameter and determining its\nbest-fit value we also obtain the best-fit parameters when correlations between\nthe rates and the spectrum data are included and the normalization of the $^8$B\nflux held fixed at its SSM value. We observe that the correlations between the\nrates and spectrum data are important and the goodness of fit worsens when\nthese are included. In either case, the best-fit lies in the LMA region.",

In finite dimension this transition exists only in this\n``marginal glass'' case (energy fluctuation exponent $\\theta=0$) and disappears\nif correlations grow faster (single ground state dominance $\\theta>0$) or\nslower (high temperature phase). The associated extremal statistics problem for\ncorrelated energy landscapes exhibits universal features which we describe\nusing a non linear (KPP) RG equation. These include the tails of the\ndistribution of the minimal energy (or free energy) and the finite size\ncorrections which are universal. The glass transition is closely related to\nDerrida's random energy models. In $d=2$ the glass transition of the particle\nexhibits interesting similarities with the weak to strong coupling transition\nin Liouville ($c=1$ barrier) and with a transition that we conjecture for the\nsinh-Gordon model. Glassy freezing of the particle is associated with the\ngeneration under RG of new local operators and of non-smooth configurations in\nLiouville.

We describe this new mechanism for baryogenesis\nand outline the region of the parameter space in which the mechanism is\nefficient. We show that present colliders can already put interesting\nconstraints on both parameters, and that future colliders will improve the\ndetection capabilities very significatively.",

The\nforce-velocity relation is obtained from the simulations for two versions of\nthe monomer-monomer force field. It is found that the growth rate drops off\nmore rapidly with applied force than expected from the simplest theories based\non thermal motion of the obstacle. The discrepancies amount to a factor of\nthree or more when the applied force exceeds 2.5kT/a, where a is the step size\nfor the polymer growth. These results are explained on the basis of restricted\ndiffusion of monomers near the fiber tip. It is also found that the mobility of\nthe obstacle has little effect on the growth rate, over a broad range.",

Unitary maps of this space onto a\nphysical parameter based product space H^{phy} are then described. Each of\nthese maps makes states in H^{phy}, and the induced operators, a model of the\naxioms. Consequences of the existence of many of these maps are discussed along\nwith the dependence of Grover's and Shor's Algorithms on these maps. The\nimportance of the main physical requirement, that the basic arithmetic\noperations are efficiently implementable, is discussed.

All important features of the system appearing in whole energy range,\nsuch as oscillations of level splittings due to Wess-Zumino effect and their\nabsence at higher magnetic field etc., can be completely understood within this\nsemiclassical scheme. We find out that the fields at which the tunnelling\nquenches do not shift at higher energy levels and the absences of the quenching\nat higher magnetic field have their origin in an exact coincidence of the\nquenching field with the field of resonant tunnelling. Based on the result, we\npropose that the complete cancellation of quenching with resonant tunnelling\nwould be a general property of Wess-Zumino tunnelling systems.",

In this article it will be shown that, in a\ncertain well-defined sense, the space of Bochner-Kahler metrics in complex\ndimension n has real dimension n+1 and a recipe for an explicit formula for any\nBochner-Kahler metric will be given.\n  It is shown that any Bochner-Kahler metric in complex dimension n has local\n(real) cohomogeneity at most n. The Bochner-Kahler metrics that can be\n`analytically continued' to a complete metric, free of singularities, are\nidentified. In particular, it is shown that the only compact Bochner-Kahler\nmanifolds are the discrete quotients of the known symmetric examples. However,\nthere are compact Bochner-Kahler orbifolds that are not locally symmetric. In\nfact, every weighted projective space carries a Bochner-Kahler metric.\n  The fundamental technique is to construct a canonical infinitesimal torus\naction on a Bochner-Kahler metric whose associated momentum mapping has the\norbits of its symmetry pseudo-groupoid as fibers.",

    "summary": "For all sources in which the phenomenon of kilo-Hertz quasi-periodic\noscillation (kHz QPO) is observed, the QPOs disappear abruptly when the\ninferred mass accretion rate exceeds a certain threshold. Although the\nthreshold cannot at present be accurately determined (or even quantified)\nobservationally, it is clearly higher for bright Z sources than for faint atoll\nsources. Here we propose that the observational manifestation of kHz QPOs {\\em\nrequires} direct interaction between the neutron star magnetosphere and the\nKeplerian accretion disk and that the cessation of kHz QPOs at high accretion\nrate is due to the lack of such an interact when the Keplerian disk terminates\nat the last stable orbit and yet the magnetosphere is pushed farther inward.\nThe threshold is therefore dependent of the magnetic field strength -- the\nstronger the magnetic field the higher the threshold. This is certainly in\nagreement with the atoll/Z paradigm, but we argue that it is also generally\ntrue, even for individual sources within each (atoll or Z) category. For atoll\nsources, the kHz QPOs also seem to vanish at low accretion rate. Perhaps the\n``disengagement'' between the magnetosphere and the Keplerian disk also takes\nplace under such circumstances, because of, for instance, the presence of\nquasi-spherical advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) close to the neutron\nstar. Unfortunately, in this case, the estimation of the accretion rate\nthreshold would require a knowledge of the physical mechanisms that cause the\ndisengagement. If the ADAF is responsible, the threshold is likely dependent of\nthe magnetic field of the neutron star.",

Doppler shifts due to thermal\nmotions of cavity walls provide necessary mixing, but also preserve the\namplitudes and phases. The lambda/2 intervals of the modes thus preserved must\nhave equal energy expectations, say <E>, in the resulting equilibrium. By\ndefinition again, they can be exchanged between modes only in whole numbers and\nhence only between harmonics. Each family of harmonic modes is thus\nself-contained and is disjoint from other families in such exchanges, and\nfurther, can have no more than one mode excited at any instant. The second\nproperty identifies harmonic families of standing wave modes as the harmonic\noscillators of Planck's theory, since a family can only bear energy equal to\nexactly one of E, 2E, 3E, etc These two properties further imply that the\nenergy expectation gets averaged only over an individual family, as the\nequilibrium energy <E(f)> steadily available at a given mode would have\ncontributions from its entire harmonic family. Planck's equations reemerge, and\nradiation quantization arises as a classical rule <E(f)> = <E>f, as a mode must\ncontain a whole number of exchangeable lambda/2 intervals, but it only concerns\nequilibrium states. The result makes Planck constant h an analogue of\nBoltzmann's constant k for the frequency domain, and points to postulate-free\nexplanations of all aspects of quantum and kinetic theories.",

The source was detected at a flux level of 3.6x10^-10 erg\ncm^-2 s^-1 in the 0.7--10.0 keV band, which corresponds to the X-ray luminosity\nof 1.8x10^38 erg s^-1, if a distance of 65 kpc for this pulsar in the Small\nMagellanic Cloud is assumed. Nearly sinusoidal pulsations with a period of\n30.9497 +/- 0.0004 s were unambiguously detected during the ASCA observation.\nThe pulsed fraction is low and slightly energy dependent with average value of\n\\~27%. The energy spectrum shows a large soft excess below ~2 keV when fitted\nto a simple power-law type model. The soft excess is eliminated if the spectrum\nis fitted to an ``inversely broken power-law'' model, in which photon indices\nbelow and above a break energy of 1.5 keV are 2.3 and 0.8, respectively. The\nsoft excess can also be described by a blackbody or a thermal bremsstrahlung\nwhen the spectrum above ~2 keV is modeled by a power-law. In these models,\nhowever, the thermal soft component requires a very large emission zone, and\nhence it is difficult to explain the observed pulsations at energies below 2\nkeV. A bright state of the source enables us to identify a weak iron line\nfeature at 6.4 keV with an equivalent width of 50 +/- 14 eV. Pulse phase\nresolved spectroscopy revealed a slight hardening of the spectrum and marginal\nindication of an increase in the iron line strength during the pulse maximum.",

For example, querying a\nplanner for an unreachable goal state. Such programs motivate the development\nof methods to prove the absence of a solution. Considering the definite program\nand the query ``<- Q'' as clauses of a first order theory, one can apply model\ngenerators which search for a finite interpretation in which the program\nclauses as well as the clause ``false <- Q'' are true. This paper develops a\nnew approach which exploits the fact that all clauses are definite. It is based\non a goal directed abductive search in the space of finite pre-interpretations\nfor a pre-interpretation such that ``Q'' is false in the least model of the\nprogram based on it. Several methods for efficiently searching the space of\npre-interpretations are presented. Experimental results confirm that our\napproach find solutions with less search than with the use of a first order\nmodel generator.",

    "summary": "We present new measurements of the ground state fine-structure line of atomic\ncarbon at 492 GHz in a variety of nearby external galaxies, ranging from spiral\nto irregular, interacting and merging types. In comparison with CO(1-0), the\nCI(1-0) intensity stays fairly comparable in the different environments, with\nan average value of the ratio of the line integrated areas in Kkm/s of\nCI(1-0)/CO(1-0) = 0.2 +/- 0.2. However, some variations can be found within\ngalaxies, or between galaxies. Relative to CO lines, CI(1-0) is weaker in\ngalactic nuclei, but stronger in disks, particularly outside star forming\nregions. Also, in NGC 891, the CI(1-0) emission follows the dust continuum at\n1.3mm extremely well along the full length of the major axis where molecular\ngas is more abundant than atomic gas. Atomic carbon therefore appears to be a\ngood tracer of molecular gas in external galaxies, possibly more reliable than\nCO. Atomic carbon can contribute significantly to the thermal budget of\ninterstellar gas. Cooling due to C and CO amounts typically to 2 x 10^{-5} of\nthe FIR continuum or 5% of the CII line. However, C and CO cooling reaches 30%\nof the gas total, in Ultra Luminous InfraRed Galaxies, where CII is abnormally\nfaint. Together with CII/FIR, the emissivity ratio CI(1-0)/FIR can be used as a\nmeasure of the non-ionizing UV radiation field in galaxies.",

In this picture, the\nproto-galactic object is likely to have undergone a very active phase during\nwhich the surrounding medium was shocked and heated up to very high\ntemperatures. We predict the cosmological effects of this scenario in terms of\nthe thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich distortions induced on galactic\nscales by a population of proto-galaxies. These predictions are compared to the\nobservational limit on the mean Compton distortion set by the COBE-FIRAS\ninstrument.

    "summary": "The Broad Histogram is a method allowing the direct calculation of the energy\ndegeneracy $g(E)$. This quantity is independent of thermodynamic concepts such\nas thermal equilibrium. It only depends on the distribution of allowed (micro)\nstates along the energy axis, but not on the energy changes between the system\nand its environment. Once one has obtained $g(E)$, no further effort is needed\nin order to consider different environment conditions, for instance, different\ntemperatures, for the same system.\n  The method is based on the exact relation between $g(E)$ and the\nmicrocanonical averages of certain macroscopic quantities $N^{\\rm up}$ and\n$N^{\\rm dn}$. For an application to a particular problem, one needs to choose\nan adequate instrument in order to determine the averages $<N^{\\rm up}(E)>$ and\n$<N^{\\rm dn}(E)>$, as functions of energy. Replacing the usual\nfixed-temperature canonical by the fixed-energy microcanonical ensemble, new\nsubtle concepts emerge. The temperature, for instance, is no longer an external\nparameter controlled by the user, all canonical averages being functions of\nthis parameter. Instead, the microcanonical temperature $T_{m}(E)$ is a\nfunction of energy defined from $g(E)$ itself, being thus an {\\bf internal}\n(environment independent) characteristic of the system. Accordingly, all\nmicrocanonical averages are functions of $E$.\n  The present text is an overview of the method. Some features of the\nmicrocanonical ensemble are also discussed, as well as some clues towards the\ndefinition of efficient Monte Carlo microcanonical sampling rules.",

    "summary": "Resummation and power-corrections play a crucial role in the phenomenology of\nevent-shape variables like the thrust T. Previous investigations showed that\nthe perturbative contribution to the average thrust is dominated by gluons of\nsmall invariant mass, of the order of 10% of Q, where Q is the center-of-mass\nenergy. The effect of soft gluons is also important, leading to a\nnon-perturbative 1/Q correction. These conclusions are based on renormalon\nanalysis in the single dressed gluon (SDG) approximation. Here we analyze\nhigher moments of the thrust distribution using a similar technique. We find\nthat the characteristic gluon invariant mass contributing to <(1-T)^m>\nincreases with m. Yet, for m=2 this scale is quite low, around 27% of Q, and\ntherefore renormalon resummation is still very important. On the other hand,\nthe power-correction to <(1-T)^2> from a single soft gluon emission is found to\nbe highly suppressed: it scales as 1/Q^3. In practice, <(1-T)^2> and higher\nmoments depend also on soft gluon emission from configurations of three hard\npartons, which may lead to alpha_s(Q^2)/Q power-corrections. This issue is yet\nto be investigated.",

    "summary": "We present a method of measuring galaxy power spectrum based on the\nmultiresolution analysis of the discrete wavelet transformation (DWT). Since\nthe DWT representation has strong capability of suppressing the off-diagonal\ncomponents of the covariance for selfsimilar clustering, the DWT covariance for\npopular models of the cold dark matter cosmogony generally is diagonal, or\n$j$(scale)-diagonal in the scale range, in which the second scale-scale\ncorrelations are weak. In this range, the DWT covariance gives a lossless\nestimation of the power spectrum, which is equal to the corresponding Fourier\npower spectrum banded with a logarithmical scaling. In the scale range, in\nwhich the scale-scale correlation is significant, the accuracy of a power\nspectrum detection depends on the scale-scale or band-band correlations. This\nis, for a precision measurements of the power spectrum, a measurement of the\nscale-scale or band-band correlations is needed. We show that the DWT\ncovariance can be employed to measuring both the band-power spectrum and second\norder scale-scale correlation. We also present the DWT algorithm of the binning\nand Poisson sampling with real observational data. We show that the alias\neffect appeared in usual binning schemes can exactly be eliminated by the DWT\nbinning. Since Poisson process possesses diagonal covariance in the DWT\nrepresentation, the Poisson sampling and selection effects on the power\nspectrum and second order scale-scale correlation detection are suppressed into\nminimum. Moreover, the effect of the non-Gaussian features of the Poisson\nsampling can be calculated in this frame.",

The linearly polarized intensity P\n(with polarized brightness temperature going up to 10K) shows a `cloudy'\nstructure, with characteristic scales of 15'-30', which contains relatively\nlong, but very narrow `canals' (essentially unresolved) in which P is only a\nsmall fraction of that in the neighbouring beams.\n  These `canals' are generally seen in more than one frequency band, although\ntheir appearance changes between bands. They are probably due to depolarization\nwithin the synthesized beam, because the change in polarization angle across\nthe deepest `canals' is in general close to 90 degrees (or 270 etc.). These\nvery abrupt changes in polarization angle, which are seen only across the\n`canals', seem to be accompanied by abrupt changes in the Rotation Measure\n(RM), which may have the right magnitude to create the difference of close to\n90 degrees in polarization angle, and thereby the `canals'.\n  The structure in the polarization maps is most likely due to Faraday rotation\nmodulation of the probably smooth polarized radiation emitted in the halo of\nour Galaxy by the fairly local ISM (up to 500 pc). Therefore, the abrupt\nchanges of RM across the `canals' provide evidence for very thin (about 1 pc),\nand relatively long transition regions in the ISM, across which the RM changes\nby as much as 100%. Such drastic RM changes may well be due primarily to abrupt\nchanges in the magnetic field.",

Secondary surveys in other ISO\nbands were undertaken by the ELAIS team within the fields of the primary\nsurvey, with 6 square degrees being covered at 6.7mu and 1 square degree at\n175mu. This paper discusses the goals of the project and the techniques\nemployed in its construction, as well as presenting details of the observations\ncarried out, the data from which are now in the public domain. We outline the\nELAIS ``Preliminary Analysis'' which led to the detection of over 1000 sources\nfrom the 15 and 90 mu surveys (the majority selected at 15mu with a flux limit\nof ~3 mJy), to be fed into a ground-based follow-up campaign, as well as a\nprogramme of photometric observations of detected sources using both ISO-CAM\nand ISO-PHOT. We detail how the ELAIS survey complements other ISO surveys in\nterms of depth and areal coverage, and show that the extensive multi-wavelength\ncoverage of the ELAIS fields resulting from our concerted and on-going\nfollow-up programme has made these regions amongst the best studied areas of\ntheir size in the entire sky, and, therefore, natural targets for future\nsurveys.

The true partition function is invariant\nunder the full modular group but the generalised partition function exhibits\nmore complicated behaviour depending on topological properties of the\nfour-manifold concerned. It is already known that there may be \"modular\nweights\" which are linear combinations of the Euler number and Hirzebruch\nsignature of the four-manifold. But sometimes the partition function transforms\nonly under a subgroup of the modular group (the Hecke subgroup). In this case\nit is impossible to define real spinor wave functions on the four-manifold. But\ncomplex spinors are possible provided the background magnetic fluxes are\nappropriately fractional rather that integral. This gives rise to a second\npartition function which enables the full modular group to be realised by\npermuting the two partition functions, together with a third. Thus the full\nmodular group is realised in all cases. The demonstration makes use of various\nconstructions concerning integral lattices and theta functions that seem to be\nof intrinsic interest.",

Lett., Vol. 77,\n2154 (1996)] which allows wave and particle attributes to co-exist, but\npostulates that a stronger manifestation of the particle nature leads to a\nweaker manifestation of the wave nature and vice versa. In this Letter, we show\nthat some recent {\\it welcher weg} (\"which path\") experiments in\ninterferometers and similar set-ups, that claim to have validated, or\ninvalidated, the Complementarity Principle, actually shed no light on the\northodox interpretation. They may have instead validated the weaker duality\ncondition, but even that is not completely obvious. We propose simple\nmodifications to these experiments which we believe can test the orthodox\nComplementarity Principle and also shed light on the nature of wavefunction\ncollapse and quantum erasure.",

In SU(5) unified models nonuniversality in the gaugino\nsector can be generated via the gauge kinetic energy function which may depend\non the 24, 75 and 200 dimensional Higgs representations. We also consider\nstring models which allow for nonuniversality of gaugino masses and D brane\nmodels where nonuniversality arises from embeddings of the Standard Model gauge\ngroup on five branes and nine branes. It is found that with gaugino mass\nnonuniversality the range of the LSP mass can be extended much beyond the range\nallowed in the universal SUGRA case, up to about 600 GeV even without\ncoannihilation effects in some regions of the parameter space. The effects of\ncoannihilation are not considered and inclusion of these effects may further\nincrease the allowed neutralino mass range. Similarly with the inclusion of\ngaugino mass nonuniversality, the neutralino-proton ($\\chi -p$) cross-section\ncan increase by as much as a factor of 10 in some of regions of the parameter\nspace. An analysis of the uncertainties in the quark density content of the\nnucleon is given and their effects on $\\chi -p$ cross-section are discussed.\nThe predictions of our analysis including nonuniversality is compared with the\ncurrent limits from dark matter detectors and implications for future dark\nmatter searches are discussed.",

    "summary": "If the stellar population of the bulge contains black holes formed in the\nfinal core collapse of ordinary stars with M \\ga 30 M_{\\odot}, then about\n25,000 stellar mass black holes should have migrated by dynamical friction into\nthe central parsec of the Milky Way, forming a black hole cluster around the\ncentral supermassive black hole. These black holes can be captured by the\ncentral black hole when they randomly reach a highly eccentric orbit due to\nrelaxation, either by direct capture (when their Newtonian peribothron is less\nthan 4 Schwarzschild radii), or after losing orbital energy through\ngravitational waves. The overall depletion timescale is ~ 30 Gyr, so most of\nthe 25,000 black holes remain in the central cluster today. The presence of\nthis black hole cluster would have several observable consequences. First, the\nlow-mass, old stellar population should have been expelled from the region\noccupied by the black hole cluster due to relaxation, implying a core in the\nprofile of solar-mass red giants with a radius of ~ 2 pc (i.e., 1'). The\nobserved central density cusp (which has a core radius of only a few arc\nseconds) should be composed primarily of young (\\la 1 Gyr) stars. Second,\nflares from stars being captured by supermassive black holes in other galaxies\nshould be rarer than usually expected because the older stars will have been\nexpelled from the central regions by the black hole clusters of those galaxies.\nThird, the young (\\la 2 Gyr) stars found at distances ~ 3 - 10 pc from the\nGalactic center should be preferentially on highly eccentric orbits. Fourth, if\nfuture high-resolution $K$-band images reveal sources microlensed by the Milky\nWay's central black hole, then the cluster black holes could give rise to\nsecondary (``planet-like'') perturbations on the main event.",

We\nconsider traces of intertwiners between certain representations of the\nquantized enveloping algebra associated to a semisimple complex Lie algebra g,\nwhich are twisted by a ``generalized Belavin-Drinfeld triple'', i.e a triple\nconsisting of two subdiagrams of the Dynkin diagram of g together with an\nisomorphism between them. The generating functions F(lambda,mu) for such traces\ndepend on two weights lambda and mu. We show that F(lambda,mu) satisfy two sets\nof difference equations in the variable lambda: the Macdonald-Ruijsenaars (MR)\nequations and the quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov\n  (qKZB) equations. These equations involve as a main ingredient the quantum\ndynamical R-matrices constructed in math.QA/9912009. When the generalized\nBelavin-Drinfeld triple is an automorphism, we show that F(lambda,mu) satisfy\nanother two sets of difference equations with respect to the weight mu. These\ndual MR and dual qKZB equations involve the usual Felder's dynamical R-matrix.\nThese results were first obtained by the first author and A. Varchenko in the\nspecial case of the trivial Belavin-Drinfeld triple. However, the symmetry\nbetween lambda and mu which exists in that case is destroyed in the twisted\nsetting.

    "summary": "Polyelectrolytes such as single and double stranded DNA and many synthetic\npolymers undergo two structural transitions upon increasing the concentration\nof multivalent salt or molecules. First, the expanded-stretched chains in low\nmonovalent salt solutions collapse into nearly neutral compact structures when\nthe density of multivalent salt approaches that of the monomers. With further\naddition of multivalent salt the chains redissolve acquiring expanded-coiled\nconformations. We study the redissolution transition using a two state model\n[F. Solis and M. Olvera de la Cruz, {\\it J. Chem. Phys.} {\\bf 112} (2000)\n2030]. The redissolution occurs when there is a high degree of screening of the\nelectrostatic interactions between monomers, thus reducing the energy of the\nexpanded state. The transition is determined by the chemical potential of the\nmultivalent ions in the solution $\\mu$ and the inverse screening length\n$\\kappa$. The transition point also depends on the charge distribution along\nthe chain but is almost independent of the molecular weight and degree of\nflexibility of the polyelectrolytes. We generate a diagram of $\\mu$ versus\n$\\kappa^2$ where we find two regions of expanded conformations, one with\ncharged chains and other with overcharged (inverted charge) chains, separated\nby a collapsed nearly neutral conformation region. The collapse and\nredissolution transitions occur when the trajectory of the properties of the\nsalt crosses the boundaries between these regions. We find that in most cases\nthe redissolution occurs within the same expanded branch from which the chain\nprecipitates.",

The four definite O VI absorbers are\nlocated near galaxies and are highly displaced from the quasar in redshift;\nthese are likely intervening systems unrelated to the background QSO. In the\ncase of the strong O VI system at z(abs) = 0.22497, multiple components are\ndetected in Si III and O VI as well as H I Lyman series lines, and the\ndiffering component velocity centroids and b-values firmly establish that this\nis a multiphase absorption system. A weak O VI absorber is detected at z(abs) =\n0.22637, i.e., offset by ~340 km/s from the z(abs) = 0.22497 system.

The number density of O VI absorbers with rest equivalent width >\n30 mA in the H1821+643 spectrum is remarkably high, dN/dz ~48, with a high\n(90%) confidence that it is greater than 17. We conservatively estimate that\nthe cosmological mass density of the O VI systems Omega_b(O VI) > 0.0008/h_75.\nWith an assumed metallicity of 1/10 solar and a conservative assumption that\nthe fraction of oxygen in the O VI ionization stage is 0.2, we obtain Omega_b(O\nVI) > 0.004/h_75.

    "summary": "In this paper we prove the Tamagawa number conjecture of Bloch and Kato for\nCM elliptic curves using a new explicit description of the specialization of\nthe elliptic polylogarithm. The Tamagawa number conjecture describes the\nspecial values of the L-function of a CM elliptic curve in terms of the\nregulator maps of the K-theory of the variety into Deligne and etale\ncohomology. The regulator map to Deligne cohomology was computed by Deninger\nwith the help of the Eisenstein symbol. For the Tamagawa number conjecture one\nneeds an understanding of the $p$-adic regulator on the subspace of K-theory\ndefined by the Eisenstein symbol. This is accomplished by giving a new explicit\ncomputation of the specialization of the elliptic polylogarithm sheaf. It turns\nout that this sheaf is an inverse limit of $p^r$-torsion points of a certain\none-motive. The cohomology classes of the elliptic polylogarithm sheaf can then\nbe described by classes of sections of certain line bundles. These sections are\nelliptic units and going carefully through the construction one finds an analog\nof the elliptic Soul\\'e elements. Finally Rubin's ``main conjecture'' of\nIwasawa theory is used to compare these elements with etale cohomology.",

These two tracers\nof dust show a very similar distribution along the minor axis and a reasonable\nagreement along the major axis. Assuming that the grains responsible for\noptical extinction are also the source of 850um emission we derive a\nsubmillimeter emissivity (emission efficiency) for dust in the NGC 891 disk.\nThis quantity is found to be a factor of 2-3 higher than the generally-accepted\n(but highly uncertain) values adopted for the Milky Way. It should be stated,\nhowever, that if a substantial fraction of dust in NGC 891 is clumped, the\nemissivity in the two galaxies may be quite similar. We use our newly-acquired\nemissivity to convert our 850um images into detailed maps of dust mass and,\nutilizing 21cm and CO-emission data for NGC 891, derive the gas-to-dust ratio\nalong the disk. We compute an average ratio of 260 -- a value consistent with\nthe Milky Way and external spirals within the uncertainties in deriving both\nthe dust mass and the quantity of molecular gas. The bulk of dust in NGC 891\nappears to be closely associated with the molecular gas phase although it may\nstart to follow the distribution of atomic hydrogen at radii >9 kpc (i.e. >0.5\nR_25). Using the optical depth of the NGC 891 disk, we quantify how light\nemitted at high redshift is attenuated by dust residing in foreground spirals.\nFor B-band observations of galaxies typically found in the Hubble Deep Field,\nthe amount of light lost is expected to be small (~ 5%). This value depends\ncritically on the maximum radial extent of cold dust in spiral disks (which is\npoorly known). It may also represent a lower limit if galaxies expel dust over\ntime into the intergalactic medium.",

As a result,\nthe [OIII] 5007/H-beta ratio emitted in the NLR varies from 1 to 5, instead of\nthe universally adopted value of 10. This has strong implications for the\nrequired spectral energy distribution that ionizes the NLR gas. Photoionization\nmodels that consider a NLR composed of a combination of matter-bounded and\nionization-bounded clouds are successful at explaining the low [OIII]\n5007/H-beta ratio and the weakness of low-ionization lines of NLS1s. Variation\nof the relative proportion of these two type of clouds nicely reproduce the\ndispersion of narrow line ratios found among the NLS1 sample. Assuming similar\nphysical model parameters of both NLS1s and the normal Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC\n5548, we show that the observed differences of emission line ratios between\nthese two groups can be explained in terms of the shape of the input ionizing\ncontinuum. Narrow emission line ratios of NLS1s are better reproduced by a\nsteep power-law continuum in the EUV -- soft X-ray region, with spectral index\nalpha ~ -2. Flatter spectral indices (alpha ~ -1.5) match the observed line\nratios of NGC 5548 but are unable to provide a good match to the NLS1 ratios.\nThis result is consistent with ROSAT observations of NLS1s, which show that\nthese objects are characterized by steeper power-law indices than those of Sy1\ngalaxies with strong broad optical lines.",

    "summary": "We present mid-IR observations of the prototypical Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1068\nobtained with ISOCAM between 5 and 16micron. The proximity of this galaxy\ncoupled with the spectro-imaging capabilities of the instrument allow us to\nseparate the mid-IR emission of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) from the\ndistinctly different emission of the circumnuclear star forming regions. The\nUnidentified Infrared Bands (UIBs), which trace the starburst contribution very\nwell, are not detected in the spectrum of the AGN region where their carriers\ncould be destroyed. Moreover, the featureless continuum of the AGN exhibits a\nstrong hot dust component below 10micron not observed in the starburst regions.\nThose two distinct mid-IR spectral properties, as well as the presence of high\nexcitation ionic lines such as [NeVI](7.7micron) and [NeV](14.3micron) in the\nAGN spectrum, provide us with very powerful complementary tools to disentangle\nAGNs from starbursts. The effects of high extinction on the mid-IR\nidentification of AGNs are also discussed.",

Thus, all\nelse (temperature, damping, coupling parameters between the chain and the\nbistable system) being the same, the hard chain may provide an environment\ndescribed as diffusion-limited and more effective in the activation process,\nwhile the soft chain may provide an environment described as energy-limited and\nless effective. The importance of a detailed understanding of the thermal\nenvironment toward the understanding of the activation process itself is thus\nhighlighted.",

Examples are provided by domination by a\nkinetic mode of a scalar field, which may be both the inflaton and the late\ntime `quintessence', and also by more conventional models of reheating. The\nresultant modification to the pre-nucleosynthesis expansion rate can allow\nsolely an asymmetry in right handed electrons to produce a net baryon asymmetry\nwhen reprocessed by the anomalous B+L violating processes of the standard\nmodel. The production of such a source asymmetry - what we term\n`electrogenesis' - requires no additional B or L violation beyond that in the\nstandard model. We consider a specific model for its generation, by a simple\nperturbative out of equilibrium decay of Higgs like scalar fields with\nCP-violating Yukawa couplings to the standard model leptons. We show that,\nbecause of the much enhanced expansion rate, such a mechanism can easily\nproduce an adequate asymmetry from scalars with masses as low as 1 TeV. Kinetic\nmode domination is strongly favoured because it evades large entropy release\nwhich dilutes the asymmetry. We also discuss briefly the effect of the abelian\nhypercharge anomaly.",

Still, there is a solution in 2\ndimensions, and this solution can be used to construct a simple 3-dimensional\ndiscrete-time universal fault-tolerant cellular automaton. This technique does\nnot help much to solve the following problems: remembering a bit of information\nin 1 dimension; computing in dimensions lower than 3; computing in any\ndimension with non-synchronized transitions.\n  Our more complex technique organizes the cells in blocks that perform a\nreliable simulation of a second (generalized) cellular automaton. The cells of\nthe latter automaton are also organized in blocks, simulating even more\nreliably a third automaton, etc. Since all this (a possibly infinite hierarchy)\nis organized in ``software'', it must be under repair all the time from damage\ncaused by errors. A large part of the problem is essentially self-stabilization\nrecovering from a mess of arbitrary size and content. The present paper\nconstructs an asynchronous one-dimensional fault-tolerant cellular automaton,\nwith the further feature of ``self-organization''. The latter means that the\ninitial configuration does not have to encode an infinite hierarchy -- this\nwill be built up over time.\n  This is a corrected and strengthened version of the journal paper of 2001.",

We use a generalized spherical model to compute the X-ray\nproperties of groups and clusters for a range of initial entropy levels in the\nICM and for a range of mass scales, cosmic epochs and background cosmologies.\nWe find that the statistical properties of the X-ray clusters strongly depend\non the value of the initial excess entropy. Assuming a constant, uniform value\nfor the excess entropy, the present-day X-ray data are well fitted for the\nfollowing range of values K_* = kT/\\mu m_p \\rho^{2/3} = (0.4\\pm 0.1) \\times\n10^{34} erg cm^2 g^{-5/3} for clusters with average temperatures kT>2 keV; K_*\n= (0.2\\pm 0.1) \\times 10^{34} erg cm^2 g^{-5/3} for groups and clusters with\naverage temperatures kT<2 keV. These values correspond to different excess\nenergy per particle of kT \\geq 0.1 (K_*/0.4\\times 10^{34}) keV. The dependence\nof K_* on the mass scale can be well reproduced by an epoch dependent external\nentropy: the relation K_* = 0.8(1+z)^{-1}\\times 10^{34} erg cm^2 g^{-5/3} fits\nthe data over the whole temperature range. Observations of both local and\ndistant clusters can be used to trace the distribution and the evolution of the\nentropy in the cosmic baryons, and ultimately to unveil the typical epoch and\nthe source of the heating processes.",

The 7C objects have radio luminosities\nabout 20 times fainter than 3C radio galaxies at a given redshift. The absolute\nmagnitudes of the underlying host galaxies and their scale sizes are only\nweakly dependent on radio luminosity. Radio galaxy hosts at z~2 are\nsignificantly brighter than the hosts of radio-quiet quasars at similar\nredshifts and the model AGN hosts of Kauffmann & Haehnelt (2000). There is no\nevidence for strong evolution in scale size, which shows a large scatter at all\nredshifts. The hosts brighten significantly with redshift, consistent with the\npassive evolution of a stellar population that formed at z>~3. This scenario is\nconsistent with studies of host galaxy morphology and submillimeter continuum\nemission, both of which show strong evolution at z>~2.5. The lack of a strong\n``redshift cutoff'' in the radio luminosity function to z>4 suggests that the\nformation epoch of the radio galaxy host population lasts >~1Gyr from z>~5 to\nz~3. We suggest these facts are best explained by models in which the most\nmassive galaxies and their associated AGN form early due to high baryon\ndensities in the centres of their dark matter haloes.",

Combined with the previous results of Brylinski, Nistor\nand the authors, this theorem completes the computation of cyclic homology for\nvarious foliation groupoids, like the (full) holonomy/monodromy groupoid, Lie\ngroupoids modeling orbifolds, and crossed products by actions of Lie groups\nwith finite stabilizers. Some parts of the proof, such as the H-unitality of\nconvolution algebras, apply to general Lie groupoids.\n  Since one of our motivation is a better understanding of various approaches\nto longitudinal index theorems for foliations, we have added a few brief\ncomments at the end of the second section.",

At the age and distance of this\ncluster, and in the absence of extinction, the hydrogen burning limit (0.08 Mo)\noccurs at K~13.5 mag while an object of mass 0.02 Mo has K~16.2 mag. Our\nphotometry is complete for source detection at the 7 sigma level to K~17.5 mag\nand thus is sensitive to objects as low-mass as 0.02 Mo seen through visual\nextinction values as high as 10 magnitudes. We use the observed magnitudes,\ncolors, and star counts to constrain the shape of the inner ONC stellar mass\nfunction across the hydrogen burning limit. After determining the stellar age\nand near-infrared excess properties of the optically visible stars in this same\ninner ONC region, we present a new technique that incorporates these\ndistributions when extracting the mass function from the observed density of\nstars in the K-(H-K) diagram. We find that our data are inconsistent with a\nmass function that rises across the stellar/sub-stellar boundary. Instead, we\nfind that the most likely form of the inner ONC mass function is one that rises\nto a peak around 0.15 Mo, and then declines across the hydrogen-burning limit\nwith slope N(log M) ~ M^(0.57+/-0.05). We emphasize that our conclusions apply\nto the inner 0.71 pc x 0.71 pc of the ONC only; they may not apply to the ONC\nas a whole where some evidence for general mass segregation has been found.",

The phase residuals give no compelling evidence for\nperiodicity, but more closely resemble timing noise as seen in radio pulsars.\nThe magnitude of the timing noise, however, is large relative to the noise\nlevel typically found in radio pulsars. Combining these results with the noise\nlevels measured for some AXPs, we find all magnetar candidates have \\Delta_8\nvalues larger than those expected from a simple extrapolation of the\ncorrelation found in radio pulsars. We find that the timing noise in SGR\n1806-20 is greater than or equal to the levels found in some accreting systems\n(e.g., Vela X-1, 4U 1538-52 and 4U 1626-67), but the spin-down of SGR 1806-20\nhas thus far maintained coherence over 6 years. Alternatively, an orbital model\nwith a period P_orb = 733 days provides a statistically acceptable fit to the\ndata.

The models were calculated with the photoionization code CLOUDY, using\nevolving starburst continua generated by the the STARBURST99 code of Leitherer\net al. (1999). We find that the models are able to reproduce the emission-line\nspectra of transition nuclei, but only for instantaneous bursts of solar or\nhigher metallicity, and only for ages of ~3-5 Myr, the period when the\nextreme-ultraviolet continuum is dominated by emission from Wolf-Rayet stars.\nFor clusters younger than 3 Myr or older than 6 Myr, and for models with a\nconstant star-formation rate, the softer ionizing continuum results in an\nemission spectrum more typical of H II regions. This model predicts that\nWolf-Rayet emission features should appear in the spectra of transition nuclei.\nWhile such features have not generally been detected to date, they could be\nrevealed in observations having higher spatial resolution. Demographic\narguments suggest that this starburst model may not apply to the majority of\ntransition nuclei, particularly those in early-type host galaxies, but it could\naccount for some members of the transition class in hosts of type Sa and later.\nThe starburst models during the Wolf-Rayet-dominated phase can also reproduce\nthe narrow-line spectra of some LINERs, but only under conditions of\nabove-solar metallicity and only if high-density gas is present (n_e >~ 10^5\ncm^{-3}).

For the two special cases of a\ncircular loop and a pair of anti-parallel lines, it is shown that the sum of an\ninfinite class of ladder-like planar diagrams, when extrapolated to strong\ncoupling, produces an expectation value characteristic of the results of the\nAdS/CFT correspondence, $<W>\\sim\\exp((constant)\\sqrt{g^2N})$. For the case of\nthe circular loop, the sum is obtained analytically for all values of the\ncoupling. In this case, the constant factor in front of $\\sqrt{g^2N}$ also\nagrees with the supergravity results. We speculate that the sum of diagrams\nwithout internal vertices is exact and support this conjecture by showing that\nthe leading corrections to the ladder diagrams cancel identically in four\ndimensions. We also show that, for arbitrary smooth loops, the ultraviolet\ndivergences cancel to order $g^4N^2$.",

When\nthe 3-space is Euclidean, the metric reduces to de Sitter's expanding universe\nmetric. Generalization yields a space-time metric that retains the `exponential\nexpansion property' of the de Sitter metric. A strictly geometric action\nprinciple gives field equations which, because they do not adhere to Einstein's\nearly confounding of energy and inertial mass with gravitating mass, admit\nsolutions that escape the Penrose-Hawking singularity theorems.

To\ninvestigate this possibility we derive the classical solutions for gravity plus\na general (arbitrary xi) massless non-minimally coupled scalar field,\nrestricting attention to the static and spherically symmetric configurations.\nAmong these classical solutions we find an entire branch of traversable\nwormholes for every xi>0.

We find that\nonly the weak forms, which constrain the information available to observers on\nboundaries, are implied by arguments using the generalized second law. The\nstrong forms, which go further and posit a bound on the entropy in spacelike\nregions bounded by surfaces, are found to suffer from serious problems, which\ngive rise to counterexamples already at the semiclassical level. The null form,\nproposed by Fischler, Susskind, Bousso and others, in which the bound is on the\nentropy of certain null surfaces, appears adequate at the level of a bound on\nthe entropy of matter in a single background spacetime, but attempts to include\nthe gravitational degrees of freedom encounter serious difficulties. Only the\nweak form seems capable of holding in the full quantum theory.\n  The conclusion is that the holographic principle is not a relationship\nbetween two independent sets of concepts: bulk theories and measures of\ngeometry vrs boundary theories and measures of information.

Such a system is written in a form which\nclarifies how a set of first-order differential operators and their inverses,\njointly with spectral resolutions of operators of Laplace type, contribute to\nsolving, at least in principle, the original ADM system.",

    "summary": "This paper describes a system, called PLP, for compiling ordered logic\nprograms into standard logic programs under the answer set semantics. In an\nordered logic program, rules are named by unique terms, and preferences among\nrules are given by a set of dedicated atoms. An ordered logic program is\ntransformed into a second, regular, extended logic program wherein the\npreferences are respected, in that the answer sets obtained in the transformed\ntheory correspond with the preferred answer sets of the original theory. Since\nthe result of the translation is an extended logic program, existing logic\nprogramming systems can be used as underlying reasoning engine. In particular,\nPLP is conceived as a front-end to the logic programming systems dlv and\nsmodels.",

In the supersymmetric model,\nsignificant effects of lepton flavor violation may appear rather through\nslepton mixing, which is in the present case generated by radiative corrections\nwith ordinary-exotic lepton couplings. We are especially interested in the mu\n-> e gamma decay. In the model without the bare mass term of vectorlike\nleptons, the supersymmetric contributions are rather suppressed due to the\napproximate U(1)_e X U(1)_mu. It is, however, remarkable that they are\nsubstantially enhanced by tan^6 beta. Then, B(mu -> e gamma) might be\ncomparable to the experimental bound for large tan beta.

We quantify lopsidedness as the amplitude <A_1> of the m=1\nFourier component of the azimuthal surface brightness distribution, averaged\nover a range of radii. We compare the young stellar content, quantified by\nEW(H\\delta_abs) and the strength of the 4000 Angstrom break (D_4000), with\nlopsidedness and find a 3-4 sigma correlation between the two. We also find a\n3.2 sigma correlation between EW(H\\beta_emission) and lopsidedness. Using the\nevolutionary population synthesis code of Bruzual & Charlot we model the\nspectra as an ``underlying population'' and a superimposed ``boost population''\nwith the aim of constraining the fractional boost in the SFR averaged over the\npast 0.5 Gyr (the characteristic lifetime of lopsidedness). From the difference\nin both EW(H\\delta_abs) and D_4000 between the most and least symmetric thirds\nof our sample, we infer that ~ 1x10^9 M_solar of stars are formed over the\nduration of a lopsided event in addition to the ``underlying'' SFH (assuming a\nfinal galactic stellar mass of 10^10 M_solar). This corresponds to a factor of\n8 increase in the SFR over the past 5x10^8 years. For the nuclear spectra, all\nof the above correlations except D_4000 vs. <A_1> are weaker than for the disk,\nindicating that in lopsided galaxies, the SF boost is not dominated by the\nnucleus.",

These HVCs have a cometary appearance in the\nposition-velocity representation and are called henceforward head-tail HVCs (HT\nHVCs).

With exception of the very faint HVC complex L, all HVC complexes\ncontain HT HVCs. The HT HVCs were analyzed statistically with respect to their\nphysical parameters like position, velocity (v_LSR,v_GSR), and column density.\nWe found a linear correlation between the fraction of HVCs having a head-tail\nstructure and the peak column density of the HVCs.

The phase integral\napproximation breaks down at the new turning points, requiring new connection\nformulas, which are derived.",

For the sentential model of belief\nstates we provide both a formal description of contexts as sub-theories\ndetermined by three parameters and a method to construct contexts. Next, we\nintroduce an accessibility ordering for belief sets, which we then use for\nselecting the best (optimal) contexts with respect to the processing effort\ninvolved in the revision. Then, for finitely axiomatizable knowledge bases, we\ncharacterize a finite accessibility ranking from which the accessibility\nordering for the entire base is generated and show how to determine the ranking\nof an arbitrary sentence in the language.

While non-logic-based robot control languages\nare well suited to express such scenarios, they fare poorly when it comes to\nprojecting, in a conspicuous way, how the world evolves when actions are\nexecuted. On the other hand, a logic-based control language like \\congolog,\nbased on the situation calculus, is well-suited for the latter. However, it has\nproblems expressing event-driven behavior. In this paper, we show how these\nproblems can be overcome by first extending the situation calculus to support\ncontinuous change and event-driven behavior and then presenting \\ccgolog, a\nvariant of \\congolog which is based on the extended situation calculus. One\nbenefit of \\ccgolog is that it narrows the gap in expressiveness compared to\nnon-logic-based control languages while preserving a semantically well-founded\nprojection mechanism.",

Stationary solutions include incoherent\n(unsynchronized) and synchronized states of the oscillator population. Assuming\na Lorentzian distribution of oscillator natural frequencies, $g(\\Omega)$, both\nlarger inertia or larger frequency spread stabilize the incoherent solution,\nthereby making harder to synchronize the population. In the limiting case\n$g(\\Omega)=\\delta(\\Omega)$, the critical coupling becomes independent of\ninertia. A richer phenomenology is found for bimodal distributions. For\ninstance, inertial effects may destabilize incoherence, giving rise to\nbifurcating synchronized standing wave states. Inertia tends to harden the\nbifurcation from incoherence to synchronized states: at zero inertia, this\nbifurcation is supercritical (soft), but it tends to become subcritical (hard)\nas inertia increases. Nonlinear stability is investigated in the limit of high\nnatural frequencies.",

One example is known in five\nspacetime dimensions, within the toroidal compactification of type IIB string\ntheory. Such special solution is allowed by the existence of a Chern-Simons\ncoupling in the Supergravity theory and by the possibility of imposing a self\nduality condition on the `rotation 2-form'. We explore three peculiar features\nof such black holes: 1) Oxidising to D=10 the five dimensional configuration\nmay be interpreted as a system of $D1-D5$ branes with a Brinkmann wave\npropagating along their worldvolume. Unlike its five dimensional Kaluza-Klein\ncompactification, the universal covering space of this manifold has no\ncausality violations. In other words, causal anomalies can be solved in higher\ndimensions. From the dual SCFT viewpoint, the causality bound for the\ncompactified spacetime arises as the unitarity bound; 2) The vanishing of the\nscattering cross section for uncharged scalars and sufficiently high angular\nmomentum of the background is shown still to hold at the level of charged\ninteractions. The same is verified when a non-minimal coupling to the geometry\nis used. Therefore, the `repulson' behaviour previously found is universal for\nnon accelerated observers; 3) The solutions are shown to have a non-standard\ngyromagnetic ratio of $g=3$. In contrast, the superpartners of a static, BPS,\nfive dimensional black hole have $g=1$. At the semi-classical level, we find\nthat a Dirac fermion propagating in the rotating hole background has $g=2\\pm1$,\ndepending on the spinor direction of the fermion being parallel to Killing or\n`anti-Killing' spinors.",

A linear analysis\npredicts that axisymmetric pinch modes of the MHD Kelvin-Helmholtz instability\nshould grow only slowly for the highly supermagnetosonic jets studied here; we\nfind no evidence for them in our simulations. Some of our models appear\nunstable to current-driven pinch modes, however the resulting pressure and\ndensity variations induced in the jet beam are not large, making this mechanism\nan unlikely source of emission knots in the jet beam. In the case of pulsed\njets, radial hoop stresses confine shocked jet material in the pulses to the\naxis, resulting in a higher density in the pulses in comparison to purely\nhydrodynamic models.",

The picture that emerges is that standard-model loop contributions\nto the effective 4-dimensional cosmological constant can be cut off at\ndistances shorter than the compactification scale. At shorter distance scales,\nrenormalization effects due to standard-model fields renormalize the 3-brane\ntension, which changes a deficit angle in the transverse space without\naffecting local quantities in the bulk.

    "summary": "Owing to its transformation property under local boosts, the Brown-York\nquasilocal energy surface density is the analogue of E in the special\nrelativity formula: E^2-p^2=m^2. In this paper I will motivate the general\nrelativistic version of this formula, and thereby arrive at a geometrically\nnatural definition of an `invariant quasilocal energy', or IQE. In analogy with\nthe invariant mass m, the IQE is invariant under local boosts of the set of\nobservers on a given two-surface S in spacetime. A reference energy subtraction\nprocedure is required, but in contrast to the Brown-York procedure, S is\nisometrically embedded into a four-dimensional reference spacetime. This\nvirtually eliminates the embeddability problem inherent in the use of a\nthree-dimensional reference space, but introduces a new one: such embeddings\nare not unique, leading to an ambiguity in the reference IQE. However, in this\ncodimension-two setting there are two curvatures associated with S: the\ncurvatures of its tangent and normal bundles. Taking advantage of this fact, I\nwill suggest a possible way to resolve the embedding ambiguity, which at the\nsame time will be seen to incorporate angular momentum into the energy at the\nquasilocal level. I will analyze the IQE in the following cases: both the\nspatial and future null infinity limits of a large sphere in asymptotically\nflat spacetimes; a small sphere shrinking toward a point along either spatial\nor null directions; and finally, in asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes.\nThe last case reveals a striking similarity between the reference IQE and a\ncertain counterterm energy recently proposed in the context of the conjectured\nAdS/CFT correspondence.",

DR\nis closely related to transition radiation (TR), which is produced when a\ncharged particle traverses the boundary between media with different dielectric\nconstants. In contrast to TR, which is now extensively used for beam diagnostic\npurposes, the potential of DR as a non-interceptive, multi-parameter beam\ndiagnostic remains largely undeveloped. For diagnostic measurements it is\nuseful to observe backward reflected DR from an circular aperture or slit\ninclined with respect to the beam velocity. However, up to now, well founded\nequations for the spectral-angular intensities of backward DR from such\napertures have not been available. We present a new derivation of the spectral\nangular intensity of backward DR produced from an inclined slit for two\norientations of the slit axis, i.e. perpendicular and parallel to the plane of\nincidence. Our mathematical approach is generally applicable to any geometry\nand simpler than the Wiener Hofp method previously used to calculate DR from\nsingle knife edges. Our results for the slit are applied to the measurement of\northogonal beam size and divergence components. We discuss the problem of\nseparating the simultaneous effects of these beam parameters on the angular\ndistribution of DR and provide solutions to this difficulty. These incude using\nthe horizontal and vertical polarization components of the radiation from a\nsingle slit and interferences from two inclined slits. Examples of DR\ndiagnostics for a 500 MeV beam are presented and the current limitations to the\ntechnique are discussed.",

The angular width, and probably the depth, of the\nabsorption appears to increase with decreasing frequency, as expected.

Perhaps surprisingly, there is some evidence\nsuggesting neutrinos have such clocks. If muon neutrinos travel on space-like\npaths then some atmospheric muon neutrinos would take such paths backwards into\nouter space and not be observed. These are lost at the source and have nothing\nto do with oscillations or flavor-changing in flight. The expected depletion of\nsource muon neutrinos is shown here to be 9%, which accounts for half of the\nmissing muon neutrino source flux reported by Super-Kamiokande.

    "summary": "We report on the results of the ASCA and ROSAT observations on RX\nJ0059.2-7138, a transient X-ray pulsar in the Small Magellanic Cloud. The\nbarycentric pulse period has been precisely determined to be 2.763221 +-\n0.000004 s. The pulse shape is almost identical in all of the energy bands. The\npulse fraction increases with the photon energy below ~2 keV, while it is\nnearly constant at ~37% above ~2 keV. The X-ray spectrum has been found to\nconsist of two components. One is dominant above 2 keV, and exhibits sinusoidal\npulsations. This component is well described by a typical model found in many\nX-ray binary pulsars, a power-law of photon index 0.4 with an exponential\ncut-off at 6.5 keV. The other is dominant below 1 keV and shows no significant\npulsation. This component is represented by either a broken power-law with\nphoton indices of 2.6 and 5.1 below and above a break energy of 0.9 keV, or a\nmetal-poor thin-thermal plasma with a temperature of 0.37 keV. The\nphase-averaged luminosity is ~1E38 erg s^-1 (0.1-10.0 keV) for both components.\nA hint of oxygen over-abundance is found in the absorbing column, possibly due\nto circumstellar gas ejected from an evolved companion.",

The central value of $B_{SL}$ will be lowered slightly by\nabout 0.003, but the ratio $n_c$ can be reduced significantly from the\ntheoretical prediction of $n_c= 1.28 \\pm 0.05$ in the SM to $n_c= 1.23 \\pm\n0.05$, $1.18 \\pm 0.05$ for $m_{H^+}=200, 100$ GeV, respectively.

    "summary": "We studied the statistical methods for the estimation of the luminosity\nfunction (LF) of galaxies. We focused on four nonparametric estimators:\n$1/V_{\\rm max}$ estimator, maximum-likelihood estimator of Efstathiou et al.\n(1988), Cho{\\l}oniewski's estimator, and improved Lynden-Bell's estimator. The\nperformance of the $1/V_{\\rm max}$ estimator has been recently questioned,\nespecially for the faint-end estimation of the LF. We improved these estimators\nfor the studies of the distant Universe, and examined their performances for\nvarious classes of functional forms by Monte Carlo simulations. We also applied\nthese estimation methods to the mock 2dF redshift survey catalog prepared by\nCole et al. (1998). We found that $1/V_{\\rm max}$ estimator yields a completely\nunbiased result if there is no inhomogeneity, but is not robust against\nclusters or voids. This is consistent with the well-known results, and we did\nnot confirm the bias trend of $1/V_{\\rm max}$ estimator claimed by Willmer\n(1997) in the case of homogeneous sample. We also found that the other three\nmaximum-likelihood type estimators are quite robust and give consistent results\nwith each other. In practice we recommend Cho{\\l}oniewski's estimator for two\nreasons: 1. it simultaneously provides the shape and normalization of the LF;\n2. it is the fastest among these four estimators, because of the algorithmic\nsimplicity. Then, we analyzed the photometric redshift data of the Hubble Deep\nField prepared by Fern\\'{a}ndez-Soto et al. (1999) using the above four\nmethods. We also derived luminosity density $\\rho_{\\rm L}$ at $B$- and\n$I$-band. Our $B$-band estimation is roughly consistent with that of Sawicki,\nLin, & Yee (1997), but a few times lower at $2.0 < z < 3.0$. The evolution of\n$\\rho_{\\rm L}(I)$ is found to be less prominent.",

The model includes the ionization of\nHII regions in the interiors of the dense clouds in which stars form and the\ninfluence of the finite lifetime of these clouds on the absorption of\nradiation. We compute the production of emission lines and the absorption of\ncontinuum radiation in the HII regions and the subsequent transfer of line and\ncontinuum radiation in the surrounding HI regions and the ambient ISM. This\nenables us to interpret simultaneously all the observations of a homogeneous\nsample of nearby UV-selected starburst galaxies, including the ratio of far-IR\nto UV luminosities, the ratio of Halpha to Hbeta luminosities, the Halpha\nequivalent width, and the UV spectral slope. We show that the finite lifetime\nof stellar birth clouds is a key ingredient to resolve an apparent discrepancy\nbetween the attenuation of line and continuum photons in starburst galaxies. In\naddition, we find that an effective absorption curve proportional to\nlambda^-0.7 reproduces the observed relation between the ratio of far-IR to UV\nluminosities and the UV spectral slope. We interpret this relation most simply\nas a sequence in the overall dust content of the galaxies. The shallow\nwavelength dependence of the effective absorption curve is compatible with the\nsteepness of known extinction curves if the dust has a patchy distribution. In\nparticular, we find that a random distribution of discrete clouds with optical\ndepths similar to those in the Milky Way provides a consistent interpretation\nof all the observations. Our model for absorption can be incorporated easily\ninto any population synthesis model. (abridged)",

This method, which is based on the quasilocal\nformalism of Brown and York, is illustrated by two applications: a calculation\nof (i) the energy flux, via gravitational waves, through a surface near\ninfinity and (ii) the tidal heating in the local asymptotic frame of a body\ninteracting with an external tidal field. The second application represents the\nfirst use of the quasilocal formalism to study a non-stationary spacetime and\nshows how such methods can be used to study tidal effects in isolated\ngravitating systems.",

The objective was to find and study more examples of\nan unusual phenomenon found for one of the velocity components of H2 in the\nspectrum of zeta Ori by Jenkins & Peimbert (1997). Specifically, they detected\na gradual shift in velocity and broadening for features arising from\nprogressively higher rotational excitations J. This effect appears to be absent\nin the spectra of both delta and epsilon Ori, which are only a few degrees away\nin the sky from zeta Ori. The absence of atomic material at a large negative\nvelocity in the spectra of delta and epsilon Ori (and its presence in zeta Ori)\nsupports a proposal by Jenkins & Peimbert that the line of sight to zeta\nintercepts a bow shock facing away from us, perhaps created by the collision of\nwind-like material with some foreground obstruction. For both stars, the H2\nabsorption features are separated into two velocity components. Total H2 column\ndensities toward delta and epsilon Ori are 5.5e14 and 1.9e16 cm^-2,\nrespectively. The rotation temperatures of the molecules with J > 2 toward\nepsilon Ori indicate that the gas is in the general vicinity of the stars that\nemit UV fluxes capable of rotationally pumping the molecules. For the strongest\ncomponent of H2 toward delta Ori, the pumping rate is lower and consistent with\na general UV flux level in the plane of the Galaxy.",

In this article, we\nintroduce two notions of universal termination of logic programming with\nTabling: quasi-termination and (the stronger notion of) LG-termination. We\npresent sufficient conditions for these two notions of termination, namely\nquasi-acceptability and LG-acceptability, and we show that these conditions are\nalso necessary in case the tabling is well-chosen. Starting from these\nconditions, we give modular termination proofs, i.e., proofs capable of\ncombining termination proofs of separate programs to obtain termination proofs\nof combined programs.

    "summary": "Infinite loops and redundant computations are long recognized open problems\nin Prolog. Two ways have been explored to resolve these problems: loop checking\nand tabling. Loop checking can cut infinite loops, but it cannot be both sound\nand complete even for function-free logic programs. Tabling seems to be an\neffective way to resolve infinite loops and redundant computations. However,\nexisting tabulated resolutions, such as OLDT-resolution, SLG- resolution, and\nTabulated SLS-resolution, are non-linear because they rely on the\nsolution-lookup mode in formulating tabling. The principal disadvantage of\nnon-linear resolutions is that they cannot be implemented using a simple\nstack-based memory structure like that in Prolog. Moreover, some strictly\nsequential operators such as cuts may not be handled as easily as in Prolog.\n  In this paper, we propose a hybrid method to resolve infinite loops and\nredundant computations. We combine the ideas of loop checking and tabling to\nestablish a linear tabulated resolution called TP-resolution. TP-resolution has\ntwo distinctive features: (1) It makes linear tabulated derivations in the same\nway as Prolog except that infinite loops are broken and redundant computations\nare reduced. It handles cuts as effectively as Prolog. (2) It is sound and\ncomplete for positive logic programs with the bounded-term-size property. The\nunderlying algorithm can be implemented by an extension to any existing Prolog\nabstract machines such as WAM or ATOAM.",

The Hubble\nDeep Field datasets include the deepest observations ever made in the\nultraviolet, optical and near infrared, reaching depths comparable to that\nexpected for NGST spectroscopy. We present the source counts, galaxy sizes and\nisophotal filling factors of the HDF-South images. The observed integrated\ngalaxy counts reach >500 galaxies per square arcminute at AB<30. We extend\nthese counts to faint levels in the infrared using models. The trend previously\nseen that fainter galaxies are smaller, continues to AB=29 in the high\nresolution HDF-S STIS image, where galaxies have a typical half-light radius of\n0.1 arcseconds. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations show that the small measured\nsizes are not due to selection effects until >29mag. Using the HDF-S NICMOS\nimage, we show that galaxies are smaller in the near infrared than they are in\nthe optical. We analyze the isophotal filling factor of the HDF-S STIS image,\nand show that this image is mostly empty sky even at the limits of galaxy\ndetection, a conclusion we expect to hold true for NGST spectroscopy. At the\nsurface brightness limits expected for NGST imaging, however, about a quarter\nof the sky is occupied by the outer isophotes of AB<30 galaxies. We discuss the\nimplications of these data on several design concepts of the NGST near-infrared\nspectrograph. We compare the effects of resolution and the confusion limit of\nvarious designs, as well as the multiplexing advantages of either multi-object\nor full-field spectroscopy. We argue that the optimal choice for NGST\nspectroscopy of high redshift galaxies is a multi-object spectrograph (MOS)\nwith target selection by a micro electro mechanical system (MEMS) device.",

We identify the progenitor's evolution\nand population with two channels: (1) the WD+RG (red-giant) and (2) the WD+MS\n(near main-sequence He-rich star) channels. In these channels, the strong wind\nfrom accreting WDs plays a key role, which yields important age and metallicity\neffects on the evolution.\n  We then address the questions whether the nature of SNe Ia depends\nsystematically on environmental properties such as metallicity and age of the\nprogenitor system and whether significant evolutionary effects exist. We\nsuggest that the variation of the carbon mass fraction $X$(C) in the C+O WD (or\nthe variation of the initial WD mass) causes the diversity of the brightness of\nSNe Ia. This model can explain the observed dependences of SNe Ia brightness on\nthe galaxy types and the distance from the galactic center.\n  Finally, applying the metallicity effect on the evolution of SN Ia\nprogenitors, we make a prediction of the cosmic supernova rate history as a\ncomposite of the supernova rates in different types of galaxies.",

An {\\it eightfold} QP pattern can be created as a broad transient\nlayer between two domains filled by square cells (SC) oriented under the angle\nof 45 degrees relative to each other. A simplest particular type of the\ntransient layer is considered in detail. The structure of the pattern is\ndescribed in terms of a system of coupled real Ginzburg-Landau (GL) equations,\nwhich are solved by means of combined numerical and analytical methods. It is\nfound that the transient ``quasicrystallic'' pattern exists exactly in a\nparametric region in which the uniform SC pattern is stable. In fact, the\ntransient layer consists of two different sublayers, with a narrow additional\none between them. The width of one sublayer (which locally looks like the\neightfold QP pattern) is large, while the other sublayer (that seems like a\npattern having a quasiperiodicity only in one spatial direction) has a width\n$\\sim 1$. Similarly, a broad stripe of a {\\it % twelvefold} QP pattern can be\ngenerated as a transient region between two domains of hexagonal cells oriented\nat the angle of 30 degrees.",

In\nthis paper we characterize $\\alpha ^{++}$-stable graphs, namely, the graphs\nwhose stability numbers are invariant to adding any two edges from their\ncomplements. We show that a K\\\"{o}nig-Egerv\\'{a}ry graph is $\\alpha\n^{++}$-stable if and only if it has a perfect matching consisting of pendant\nedges and no four vertices of the graph span a cycle. As a corollary it gives\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for $\\alpha ^{++}$-stability of bipartite\ngraphs and trees. For instance, we prove that a bipartite graph is $\\alpha\n^{++}$-stable if and only if it is well-covered and C4-free.",

The\noptical and X-ray afterglow of this burst were fairly typical and are explained\nby a jet fireball. In contrast, the radio light curve is unusual in two\nrespects: (a) the radio light curve does not show the usual rise to maximum\nflux on timescales of weeks and instead appears to be declining already on day\n1 and (b) the power law indices show significant steepening from the radio\nthrough the X-ray bands. We show that the standard fireball model, in which the\nafterglow is from a forward shock, is unable to account for (b) and we conclude\nthat the bulk of the radio emission must arise from a different source. We\nconsider two models, neither of which can be ruled out with the existing data.\nIn the first (conventional) model, the early radio emission is attributed to\nemission from the reverse shock as in the case of GRB 990123. We predict that\nthe prompt optical emission would have been as bright (or brighter) than 8th\nmagnitude. In the second (exotic) model, the radio emission originates from the\nforward shock of an isotropically energetic fireball (10^54 erg) expanding into\na tenuous medium (10^-4 cm^-3). The resulting fireball would remain\nrelativistic for months and is potentially resolvable with VLBI techniques.\nFinally, we note that the near-IR bump of the afterglow is similar to that seen\nin GRB 971214 and no fireball model can explain this bump.",

The E-Planner is based\nupon a reformulation of the Language E in argumentation terms and a natural\nproof theory resulting from the reformulation.

As intuitively expected, the graviton is\neffectively four dimensional at intermediate scales and becomes five\ndimensional at large scales. However in the holographic effective theory the\nessentially 4D radion dominates at long distances and gives rise to scalar\nanti-gravity. The holographic description shows that at large distances the GRS\nmodel is equivalent to the model recently proposed by Dvali, Gabadadze and\nPorrati (DGP), where a tensionless brane is embedded into 5D Minkowski space,\nwith an additional induced 4D Einstein-Hilbert term on the brane. In the\nholographic description the radion of the GRS model is automatically localized\non the tensionless brane, and provides the ghost-like field necessary to cancel\nthe extra graviton polarization of the DGP model. Thus, there is a holographic\nduality between these theories. This analysis provides physical insight into\nhow the GRS model works at intermediate scales; in particular it sheds light on\nthe size of the width of the graviton resonance, and also demonstrates how the\nholographic RG can be used as a practical tool for calculations.",

    "summary": "We present a theoretical model for the alternating phase lags associated with\nQPO fundamental and harmonic frequencies observed in some Galactic black-hole\ncandidates. We assume that the accretion flow exhibits a transition from an\nouter cool, optically thick accretion disk to a hot, inner advection-dominated\naccretion flow (ADAF), and that the QPOs are related to small-scale\noscillations of the accretion rate and the transition radius. We present an\nanalytical estimate of the expected phase lags at the fundamental and first\nharmonic frequencies of the QPOs and perform detailed time-dependent\nMonte-Carlo simualtions of the radiation transport in the oscillating ADAF /\ncool disk system. We find that this model is well suited to reproduce\nalternating phase lags between the fundamental and the first harmonic. It also\nnaturally explains the trend observed in GRS 1915+105 that, as the soft X-ray\nluminosity increases, the QPO frequency increases and the phase lag associated\nwith the QPO fundamental frequency changes sign from positive to negative. The\nrelation between the disk temperature and the QPO frequency observed in GRS\n1915+105 is consistent with a secular instability modulating the disk\nevaporation at the transition radius.",

We use the setting of the nonlocal quantum field theories NLQFT\nwith a finite scale parameter Lambda, which are unitary for finite Lambda. We\npropose that the condition 0 < Z < 1 [wherever proven] can be rigorously\nimplemented/imposed in such theories and that it implies the existence of a\nmass scale Lambda that can be determined from this condition. We derive the\nnonlocal analogue of the above relation [which is a finite relation in NLQFT]\nand demonstrate that it can be arrived at only from general principles. We\nfurther propose that the nonlocal formulation should be looked as an effective\nfield theory that incorporates the effect of dynamics beyond an energy scale\nand which breaks at the intrinsic scale Lambda so obtained.

We found that overlapping lines and free-bound continuum\ncause strong coupling in the derived abundances of various elements. The\nabundance determination is also difficult due to the uncertainties in the Fe-L\natomic physics, because Fe-L lines couple with O and Ne K-lines. However, when\nabundances of $\\alpha$-elements are fixed, all the plasma codes give similar Fe\nabundances with a scattering of only 20-30%. To relax the strong coupling among\nthe elements, we included 20% systematic errors in the Fe-L region of the\nspectra. Then, in X-ray luminous galaxies, the derived abundance of Fe and\n$\\alpha$-elements both became $\\sim 1$ solar within a factor of 2. This result\nrelaxes the previous severe discrepancy between the ISM and stellar\nmetallicities. The ISM metallicity in X-ray fainter galaxies is still\nuncertain, but we can at least constrain that contribution from type-Ia SN to\nthe ISM abundance is lower than in X-ray luminous systems. These results\nstrongly suggest that a large fraction of SN Ia products have escaped into\nintergalactic space.",

This has allowed diffraction-limited imaging of a large number\nof bright astrophysical targets, including the geometrically complex dust\nenvelopes around a number of evolved stars. The successful restoration of these\nimages, with dynamic ranges in excess of 200:1, highlights the significant\ncapabilities of sparse aperture imaging as compared with more conventional\nfilled-pupil speckle imaging for the class of bright targets considered here.\nIn particular the enhancement of the signal-to-noise ratio of the Fourier data,\nprecipitated by the reduction in atmospheric noise, allows high fidelity\nimaging of complex sources with small numbers of short-exposure images relative\nto speckle. Multi-epoch measurements confirm the reliability of this imaging\ntechnique and our whole dataset provides a powerful demonstration of the\ncapabilities of aperture masking methods when utilized with the current\ngeneration of large-aperture telescopes.

We show that in this\nkinematical regime, the solution of the AGL equation coincides with the\nsolution of an evolution equation, obtained recently using the\nMcLerran-Venugopalan approach. Using the asymptotic behavior of the gluon\ndistribution we calculate the $F_2$ structure function assuming first that the\nleading twist relation between these two quantities is valid and second that\nthis relation is modified by the higher twist terms associated to the unitarity\ncorrections. In the first case we obtain that the corresponding $F_2$ structure\nfunction is linearly proportional to $ln s$, which agrees with the results\nobtained recently by Kovchegov using a distinct approach. In the second case a\nsofter behavior is obtained. In both cases, the $F_2$ structure function\nunitarizes and the Froissart boundary is not violated in the asymptotic regime\nof high density QCD. We conclude that the partial saturation of the gluon\ndistribution and the unitarization of the structure function are general\nresults, well-established by three distinct approaches for high dense systems.",

Two most natural regularizations of\nthis problem, namely the regularization via adding small molecular diffusion\nand the regularization via smoothing out the velocity field are considered.\nWhite-in-time random velocity fields are used as an example to examine the\nvariety of phenomena that take place when the velocity field is not spatially\nregular. Three different regimes characterized by their degrees of\ncompressibility are isolated in the parameter space. In the regime of\nintermediate compressibility, the two different regularizations give rise to\ntwo different scaling behavior for the structure functions of the passive\nscalar. Physically this means that the scaling depends on Prandtl number. In\nthe other two regimes the two different regularizations give rise to the same\ngeneralized flows even though the sense of convergence can be very different.\nThe ``one force, one solution'' principle and the existence and uniqueness of\nan invariant measure are established for the scalar field in the weakly\ncompressible regime, and for the difference of the scalar in the strongly\ncompressible regime.",

The central result of this paper is that\nthe velocity of pulled fronts converges universally for time $t\\to\\infty$ like\n$v(t)=v^*-3/(2\\lambda^*t) + (3\\sqrt{\\pi}/2)\nD\\lambda^*/(D{\\lambda^*}^2t)^{3/2}+O(1/t^2)$. The parameters $v^*$,\n$\\lambda^*$, and $D$ are determined through a saddle point analysis from the\nequation of motion linearized about the unstable invaded state. The interior of\nthe front is essentially slaved to the leading edge, and we derive a simple,\nexplicit and universal expression for its relaxation towards\n$\\phi(x,t)=\\Phi^*(x-v^*t)$. Our result, which can be viewed as a general center\nmanifold result for pulled front propagation, is derived in detail for the well\nknown nonlinear F-KPP diffusion equation, and extended to much more general\n(sets of) equations (p.d.e.'s, difference equations, integro-differential\nequations etc.). Our universal result for pulled fronts thus implies\nindependence (i) of the level curve which is used to track the front position,\n(ii) of the precise nonlinearities, (iii) of the precise form of the linear\noperators, and (iv) of the precise initial conditions. Our simulations confirm\nall our analytical predictions in every detail. A consequence of the slow\nalgebraic relaxation is the breakdown of various perturbative schemes due to\nthe absence of adiabatic decoupling.",

John Woods\nshowed that breaking internal waves on horizontal dye sheets in the interior of\nthe stratified ocean form highly persistent remnants of these turbulent events,\nwhich he called fossil turbulence.

We also compute the QED one-loop radiative corrections for the\nform factors for the graviton coupling to the electron and photon. Although the\nunderlying model is derived from elementary QED perturbative couplings, it in\nfact can be used to simulate much more general bound state systems by applying\nspectral integration over the constituent masses while preserving all of the\nLorentz properties, giving explicit realization of the spin sum rules and other\nlocal matrix elements. The role of orbital angular momentum in understanding\nthe \"spin crisis\" problem for relativistic systems is clarified. We also prove\nthat the anomalous gravitomagnetic moment B(0) vanishes for any composite\nsystem. This property is shown to follow directly from the Lorentz boost\nproperties of the light-cone Fock representation and holds separately for each\nFock state component. We show how the QED perturbative structure can be used to\nmodel bound state systems while preserving all Lorentz properties.

We point out that these conditions\nare not satisfied for pulled fronts propagating into an unstable state: their\nrelaxation on the inner scale is power law like and in conjunction with this,\nsolvability integrals diverge. The physical origin of this is traced to the\nfact that the important dynamics of pulled fronts occurs in the leading edge of\nthe front rather than in the nonlinear internal front region itself. As recent\nwork on the relaxation and stochastic behavior of pulled fronts suggests, when\nsuch fronts are coupled to other fields or to noise, the dynamical behavior is\noften qualitatively different from the standard case in which fronts between\ntwo (meta)stable states or pushed fronts propagating into an unstable state are\nconsidered.",

The X-ray light curve shows a very rapid flare\nin which the 2-10 keV flux increased by ~60% in <200 seconds. This rapid rise\nis followed by a drop-off in the 2-10 keV flux of ~40% in <600 seconds. The\n10-15 keV variation in this flare is roughly a factor of two on similar\ntime-scales. During the rise of the flare, the 3-15 keV spectral index hardened\nfrom 2.02 +/- 0.03 to 1.87 +/- 0.04, where it remained during the decay of the\nflare. This is the fastest variation ever seen in X-rays from Mrk 501 and among\nthe fastest seen at any wavelength for this object. The shift in the energy at\nwhich the spectral power peaks (from <3 keV before the flare to >30 keV during\nthe flare) is also among the most rapid shifts seen from this object. This\nflare occurs during an emission state (2-10 keV flux approximately 1.2e-10 erg\ncm^-2 s^-1) that is approximately 25% of the peak flux observed in 1997 April\nfrom this object but which is still high compared to its historical average\nX-ray flux. The variations in the hardness ratio are consistent with the low\nenergy variations leading those at high energies during the development and\ndecay of the flare. This pattern is rare among high frequency peaked BL Lac\nobjects like Mrk 501, but has been seen recently in two other TeV emitting BL\nLacs, Mrk 421 and PKS 2155-304. The hard lag is consistent with a flare\ndominated by the acceleration time-scale for a simple relativistic shock model\nof flaring.",

We identify candidate critical points\nfor the recently observed quantum-critical behavior in photoemission\nexperiments on BSCCO by Valla et al. (Science 285, 2110 (1999)). These involve\nonset of a charge density wave, or of broken time-reversal symmetry with (d+id)\nor (s+id) pairing, in a d-wave superconductor. It is not required (although it\nis allowed) that the stable state in the doped cuprates to be anything other\nthan the d-wave superconductor--the other states need only be stable nearby in\nparameter space. At finite temperatures, fluctuations associated with these\nnearby states lead to the observed fermion damping in the vicinity of the nodal\npoints in the Brillouin zone. The cases with broken time-reversal symmetry are\nappealing because the order parameter is not required to satisfy any special\ncommensurability conditions.

The\neffective potential is also obtained to this order and its properties\nareelucidated. In order to compare theoretical predictions against numerical\nsolutions of the time-dependent Schrodinger equation, we consider two initial\nconditions consistent with O(N) symmetry, one of them a quantum roll, the other\na wave packet initially to one side of the potential minimum, whose center has\nall coordinates equal. For the case of the quantum roll we map out the domain\nof validity of the large-N expansion. We discuss unitarity violation in the 1/N\nexpansion; a well-known problem faced by moment truncation techniques. The 1/N\nresults, both static and dynamic, are also compared to those given by the\nHartree variational ansatz at given values of N.

There may be more than one way in which A can be so extended\nby K: in choice revision, one such ``extension'' represents the revised state;\nalternately revision consists of the intersection of all such extensions.\n  The most general formulation of our approach is flexible enough to express\nother approaches to revision and update, the merging of knowledge bases, and\nthe incorporation of static and dynamic integrity constraints. Our framework\ndiffers from work based on ordinal conditional functions, notably with respect\nto iterated revision. We argue that the approach is well-suited for\nimplementation: the choice revision operator gives better complexity results\nthan general revision; the approach can be expressed in terms of a finite\nknowledge base; and the scope of a revision can be restricted to just those\npropositions mentioned in the sentence for revision A.",

The results are compared to the spectra of Bi_2CuO_4,\nSr_2CuO_3, and Sr_2CuO_2Cl_2. Our analysis allows to distinguish between\neffects of the Cu-O geometry and effects from material-specific properties.",

The larger shell is about 610 pc in diameter and\nvery empty, with density contrast of at least 15 between the middle and the\nshell walls.

They lie\non the edge of the Carina arm, which suggests that they may be expanding\nhorizontally into the interarm region as well as vertically out of the disk.

We describe an algorithm that allows branch-and-bound\nproblems to be solved in such environments. In designing this algorithm, we\nfaced two challenges: (1) scalability, to effectively exploit the variably\nsized pools of resources available, and (2) fault tolerance, to ensure the\nreliability of services. We achieve scalability through a fully decentralized\nalgorithm, by using a membership protocol for managing dynamically available\nresources. However, this fully decentralized design makes achieving reliability\neven more challenging. We guarantee fault tolerance in the sense that the loss\nof up to all but one resource will not affect the quality of the solution. For\npropagating information efficiently, we use epidemic communication for both the\nmembership protocol and the fault-tolerance mechanism. We have developed a\nsimulation framework that allows us to evaluate design alternatives. Results\nobtained in this framework suggest that our techniques can execute scalably and\nreliably.",

    "summary": "The duration of starbursts is important for determining how they are\nregulated and the impact they have on their environment. Starbursts contain\nnumerous prominent star clusters which typically comprise in total ~20% of the\nultraviolet light, embedded in a diffuse glow of recently formed stars\nresponsible for the dominant ~80%. Hubble Space Telescope images have been\nobtained for four starburst galaxies in order to determine their burst duration\nfrom the ages of their star clusters. Preliminary results for NGC3310 are\nreported here. The UBI colors of its clusters and diffuse light give consistent\nresults. The clusters have a broad range of colors, consistent with a\npopulation of instantaneous bursts with ages ranging from 0 to a few 100 Myr.\nThe diffuse light has a narrow range of color consistent with continuous star\nformation over timescales ranging from ~ 10 to 100 Myr. Hence NGC3310's\nstarburst has lasted ~100 Myr, or about 10 times the crossing time. Other\nresults noted in the literature also indicate bursts lasting several times\nlonger than the crossing time. These results suggest that starbursts are not\nself-extinguishing flashes. Rather they are sustainable, perhaps\nself-regulated.",

Along with the serial version of the code, we discuss a parallel\nversion that has been designed to run on massively parallel supercomputers with\ndistributed memory. While both versions use a tree algorithm to compute\ngravitational forces, the serial version of GADGET can optionally employ the\nspecial-purpose hardware GRAPE instead of the tree. Periodic boundary\nconditions are supported by means of an Ewald summation technique. The code\nuses individual and adaptive timesteps for all particles, and it combines this\nwith a scheme for dynamic tree updates. Due to its Lagrangian nature, GADGET\nthus allows a very large dynamic range to be bridged, both in space and time.\nSo far, GADGET has been successfully used to run simulations with up to 7.5e7\nparticles, including cosmological studies of large-scale structure formation,\nhigh-resolution simulations of the formation of clusters of galaxies, as well\nas workstation-sized problems of interacting galaxies. In this study, we detail\nthe numerical algorithms employed, and show various tests of the code. We\npublically release both the serial and the massively parallel version of the\ncode.",

    "summary": "ZZ Ceti stars exhibit small amplitude photometric pulsations in multiple\ngravity-modes. We demonstrate that parametric instability, a form of resonant\n3-mode coupling, limits overstable modes to amplitudes similar to those\nobserved. In particular, it reproduces the observed trend that longer period\nmodes have larger amplitudes. Parametric instability involves the\ndestabilization of a pair of stable daughter modes by an overstable parent\nmode. The 3-modes must satisfy exact angular selection rules and approximate\nfrequency resonance. The lowest instability threshold for each parent mode is\nprovided by the daughter pair that minimizes\n$(\\delta\\omega^2+\\gamma_d^2)/\\kappa^2$, where $\\kappa$ is the nonlinear\ncoupling constant, $\\delta\\omega$ is the frequency mismatch, and $\\gamma_d$ is\nthe energy damping rate of the daughter modes. The overstable mode's amplitude\nis maintained at close to the instability threshold value.\n  Although parametric instability defines an upper envelope for the amplitudes\nof overstable modes in ZZ Ceti stars, other nonlinear mechanisms are required\nto account for the irregular distribution of amplitudes of similar modes and\nthe non-detection of modes with periods longer than $1,200\\s$. Resonant 3-mode\ninteractions involving more than one excited mode may account for the former.\nOur leading candidate for the latter is Kelvin-Helmholtz instability of the\nmode-driven shear layer below the convection zone.",

However, the ratio\nm^*_c/m_e contains both the renormalization due to the electron-electron\ninteraction and the periodic potential of the lattice. We show that for any\nquasi-two-dimensional band structure, the cyclotron mass is proportional to the\ndensity of states at the Fermi energy. Due to Luttinger's theorem, this result\nis also valid in the presence of interactions. We then evaluate m_c for several\nmodel band structures for the \\beta, \\kappa, and \\theta families of\n(BEDT-TTF)_2X, where BEDT-TTF is bis-(ethylenedithia-tetrathiafulvalene) and X\nis an anion. We find that for \\kappa-(BEDT-TTF)_2X, the cyclotron mass of the\n\\beta-orbit, m^{*\\beta}_c, is close to 2 m^{*\\alpha}_c, where m^{*\\alpha}_c is\nthe effective mass of the \\alpha- orbit. This result is fairly insensitive to\nthe band structure details.

Further, in contrast to the interacting half-filled band, in\nthe interacting quarter-filled band there are two transitions: first, a similar\nsinglet-to-AFM/SDW transition for large anisotropy and second, an\nAFM/SDW-to-singlet transition at smaller anisotropy.

A good knowledge of the nuclear reaction\nrates of production and destruction of 18F is required to study 18F synthesis\nin novae and the resulting gamma-ray emission. The rates relevant for the main\nmode of 18F destruction (i.e, through proton captures) have been the object of\nmany recent experiments. However, subsequent analyses were focused on providing\nrates for X-ray burst nucleosynthesis not valid at nova temperatures (lower\nthan 3.5 10^8 K). Accordingly, it is crucial to propose and discuss new\nreaction rates, incorporating all new experimental results, down to the domain\nof nova nucleosynthesis. We show that in this temperature regime, the\n18F(p,gamma) and (p,alpha) reaction rates remain uncertain and deserve further\nexperimental and theoretical efforts. Our hydrodynamic calculations including\nthe new nuclear rates demonstrate that their impact on 18F synthesis in nova\nexplosions is quite large and, consequently, the early gamma-ray emission from\nclassical novae is also affected.",

We focus on the two following aspects: the Warm Absorber, mainly\nresponsible of the soft X-ray properties, and the reprocessing/reflecting\nplasma medium at the origin of the iron Kalpha fluorescent line. The physical\nparameters and the location of the so-called Warm Absorber (WA), a photoionized\nmedium along the line of sight to the nuclear region, are more strongly\nconstrained by optical coronal lines than by the oxygen edges observed in the\nsoft X-rays and produced by the WA. The photoionization models also predict the\nintensities of the X-ray emission lines which are going to be detected with the\nnew generation of X-ray satellites. An alternative model to the relativistic\naccretion disc is proposed to explain the profile of the X-ray iron Kalpha line\nobserved in the Seyfert 1. This line can be formed in the framework of a\nquasi-spherical accretion of optically thick clouds. An optically thick\nphotoionization code coupled with a Monte-Carlo code has been developed to\ncompute the entire spectrum from the IR to the hard X-rays for a close geometry\nwith a large covering factor. The multiple Compton reflections allow to\nreproduce the redshifted broad iron line as detected in several Seyfert 1\ngalaxies and in MCG-6-30-15.",

We calculate the [FeII]/[OI] flux ratio in\nshocks, and compare the results with the observational data. When only 20% of\niron is in the gas phase, the models reproduce most successfully the\nobservations. This finding is in conflict with the current consensus that\nshocks destroy almost all the grains and 100% of metals are in the gas phase.\nWe comment on previous works on grain destruction, and discuss why grains are\nnot destroyed in shocks.",

Maps of the linear polarization at a resolution of <0.2'' have been\nmade in the J, H and K bands and in a narrow 2.15micron continuum band (K_c).\nThe overall appearance of the nebula in the near-IR is similar in all bands and\nto that at V, with specific features less sharp to longer wavelengths. The\nlarge-scale pattern of polarization vectors is centro-symmetric demonstrating\nthat single scattering dominates everywhere except perhaps in the central\nbright core. Polarization maps at K_c in the near vicinity of Eta Carinae were\nrestored using a PSF derived from blind deconvolution. An extension of the flux\nin the direction of the optically visible speckle knots was detected, with 18%\npolarization determined for one knot.\n  The most remarkable result of the linear polarization mapping is the level of\nsimilarity in the spatial structure, and the degree of polarization, between\nthe near-IR and optical data. Such a polarization pattern cannot arise in Mie\nscattering from a single power law distribution of grain sizes unless the\nparticles are very small compared with the wavelength, in disagreement with\nmid-IR observations. The colour dependence of the extinction was found to be\nshallower than the typical ISM, indicating the presence of large grains.\nOptical depth effects and a broad distribution in grain sizes are suggested to\nexplain these contradictory results, perhaps with a dependence of the grain\nsize with depth into the small obscuring clouds in the Homunculus lobes.\nHowever the presence of aligned grains, previously inferred from mid-IR\npolarization, may also affect the dust-scattered radiation.

The\ncalculations are done using a one-dimensional model where the order parameter\ndepends only on the coordinate in the direction of the superfluid velocity v_s.\nWe concentrate on the case that the external magnetic field H is perpendicular\nto v_s, where only few results are available analytically. We calculate the\ncritical velocity v_c at which the superflow becomes unstable against the\nformation of continuous vortices. The detailed dependence of v_c on the\ntemperature and on the form of the underlying orbital texture l(r) is\ninvestigated. Both uniform and helical textures and two types of domain-wall\nstructures are studied. The results are partially in agreement with experiments\nmade in a rotating cylinder.",

Allowance is made for a possible supermassive black hole, as\nwell as low amplitude friction, noise, and periodic driving which can mimic\nirregularities associated with discreteness effects and/or an external\nenvironment. The degree of chaos is quantified by determining how (1) the\nrelative number of chaotic orbits and (2) the size of the largest Lyapunov\nexponent depend on the steepness of the cusp and the black hole mass, and (3)\nthe extent to which Arnold webs significantly impede phase space transport,\nboth with and without perturbations. In the absence of irregularities, chaotic\norbits tend to be extremely `sticky,' so that different pieces of the same\nchaotic orbit can behave very differently for 10000 dynamical times or longer,\nbut even very low amplitude perturbations can prove efficient in erasing many\n-- albeit not all -- these differences. The implications thereof are discussed\nboth for the structure and evolution of real galaxies and for the possibility\nof constructing approximate near-equilibrium models using Schwarzschild's\nmethod. Much of the observed qualitative behaviour can be reproduced with a toy\npotential given as the sum of an anisotropic harmonic oscillator and a\nspherical Plummer potential, which suggests that the results may be generic.",

Interactions among\nfields can then be included consistently with the underlying gauge symmetries.\nThrough this process a relation between Dirac's work in 1936 on conformal\nsymmetry in field theory and the more recent worldline formulation of two-time\nphysics is established while providing a worldline gauge symmetry basis for the\nfield equations in d+2 dimensions. It is shown that the field theory formalism\ngoes well beyond Dirac's goal of linearizing conformal symmetry. In accord with\nrecent results in the worldline approach of two-time physics, the d+2 field\ntheory can be brought down to diverse d dimensional field theories by solving\nthe subset of field equations that correspond to the ``kinematic'' constraints.\nThis process embeds the one ``time'' in d-dimensions in different ways inside\nthe d+2 dimensional spacetime. Thus, the two-time d+2 field theory appears as a\nmore fundamental theory from which many one-time d dimensional field theories\nare derived. It is suggested that the hidden symmetries and relations among\ncomputed quantities in certain d-dimensional interacting field theories can be\ntaken as the evidence for the presence of a higher unifying structure in a d+2\ndimensional spacetime.

Each vacuum state is realized as a particular spin\nconfiguration separated from others by potential barriers. The benefit of such\nsystem in practical applications is that it can be used as high density\nmagnetic recording system which can reduce storage of one bit information to\n$nm$ scale. The information is stored as a particular vacuum state of the\nsystem. The process of recording can be visualized as a process in which the\nsystem moves from one vacuum state to another. Storing information in the form\nof different vacuum states separated by potential barriers will allow to\nprotect it from fluctuations and for a longer time. These materials can be\nrealized as lattices of nuclear spins with specially adjusted interactions. The\nplanes of flipped spins can in principle be of atomic scale.",

Furthermore, the large radius of close-in gas giant is\nnot due to the thermal expansion of its atmosphere, but to the high residual\nentropy that remains throughout its bulk by dint of its early proximity to a\nluminous primary. The large stellar flux does not inflate the planet, but\nretards its otherwise inexorable contraction from a more extended configuration\nat birth. This implies either that such a planet was formed near its current\norbital distance or that it migrated in from larger distances ($\\geq$0.5 A.U.),\nno later than a few times $10^7$ years of birth.",

We concentrate on the\ncase when the amount of field line twisting through the disc-magnetosphere\ninteraction is large and consider different outer boundary conditions. In\ngeneral the field line twisting produces field line inflation (eg. Bardou &\nHeyvaerts 1996) and in some cases with large twisting many field lines can\nbecome open. We calculate the spin-down torque acting between the star and the\ndisc and we find that it decreases significantly for cases with large field\nline twisting. This suggests that the oscillating torques observed for some\naccreting neutron stars could be due to the magnetosphere varying between\nstates with low and high field line inflation. Calculations of the spin\nevolution of T Tauri stars may also have to be revised in light of the\nsignificant effect that field line twisting has on the magnetic torque\nresulting from star-disc interactions.",

We also discuss certain necessary conditions for a theory of gravity\nand an antisymmetric tensor in an arbitrary dimension D to admit a consistent\nsphere reduction, keeping all the massless fields. We find that it is only\npossible for D=11, with a 4-form field, and D=10, with a 5-form. Furthermore,\nin D=11 the full bosonic structure of eleven-dimensional supergravity is\nrequired, while in D=10 the 5-form must be self-dual.

The subleading parameter $c_3$ in the approximant is then\nfixed in such a way that the correct known location of the leading infrared\nrenormalon pole is reproduced. Thus, $beta$-functions which go beyond the last\nperturbatively calculated order in the observable are used. The\n$\\beta$-functions in the approximant are quasianalytically continued by Pade\napproximants. Two aspects of nonperturbative physics are accounted for in the\npresented resummation: a mechanism of quasianalytic continuation from the weak-\ninto the strong-coupling regime, and the (approximant-specific) contribution of\nthe leading infrared renormalon. The case of the Bjorken polarized sum rule is\nconsidered as a specific example of how the method works.",

These spectra do not show\nany correlation between the continuum flux and the MgII line flux, thus\nresolving a standing controversy in the literature concerning the origin of the\nMgII line flux. There is no correlation between the color temperature of the UV\ncontinuum and the average value of its flux. Using models of the accretion\nprocess developed by Calvet & Gullbring (1998), we obtain energy fluxes,\naccretion spot sizes, and accretion rates from the IUE observations of BP\nTauri. We find average energy fluxes of 5.0 10^11 ergs cm^{-2} s^{-1}, average\nspot sizes of 4.4 10^{-3} times the stellar surface, and average accretion\nrates of 1.6 10^-8 msun/yr. Our analysis shows that the particle energy flux\nand the UV flux in the stellar surface are proportional to each other. Most\nstrikingly, we observe a correlation between accretion rate and spot size, with\nthe spot size increasing as the square of the accretion rate. Based on the\nresults of a simulation, we conclude that geometrical effects are not enough to\naccount for this effect. Current models of the accretion process fail to\nreproduce such an effect, suggesting the need of using more realistic\ndescriptions of the stellar field when treating magnetospheric accretion.

Its young age (5 Myr) makes it an ideal place to search for low-mass stars\nand brown dwarfs, as these objects should be relatively bright. We have\nperformed a photometric search for the low-mass members of the association,\nusing the R, I, and Z filters. The completeness limit is I=18.5 and the\nsaturation limit is I=13. We obtain 138 candidate members, covering nearly the\nentire M spectral type range. We find an excess of brown dwarf candidates over\nthe number predicted by a Miller-Scalo Initial Mass Function. In addition, we\nhave performed infrared imaging and low resolution optical spectroscopy of\nselected candidates. We find that the infrared observations confirm the\nspectral types obtained with the optical photometry. Furthermore, we find\nH_alpha in emission in 20 of the 22 objects observed spectroscopically. As\nH_alpha is an indicator of youth, we believe that these 20 objects may belong\nto the association. One of them, UScoCTIO 128 has a very strong and constant\nH_alpha line (equivalent width: -130 A), and its position in the color\nmagnitude diagram suggests that it is a brown dwarf with mass equal to 0.02\nmsun. Confirmation of this and the other candidates will have to wait for\nhigher resolution observations that can reveal spectroscopic mass indicators\nlike Li I and gravity indicators, such as K I and the subordinate lines of Na\nI.",

One of\nthe goals of this new search was to locate more examples of the latest L\ndwarfs. Of the 67 new discoveries, 17 have types of L6 or later. Analysis of\nthese new discoveries shows that H-alpha emission has yet to be convincingly\ndetected in any L dwarf later than type L4.5, indicating a decline or absence\nof chromospheric activity in the latest L dwarfs. Further analysis shows that\n16 (and possibly 4 more) of the new L dwarfs are lithium brown dwarfs and that\nthe average line strength for those L dwarfs showing lithium increases until\nroughly type L6.5 V then declines for later types. This disappearance may be\nthe first sign of depletion of atomic lithium as it begins to form into\nlithium-bearing molecules. Another goal of the search was to locate nearer,\nbrighter L dwarfs of all subtypes. Using absolute magnitudes for 17 L dwarf\nsystems with trigonometric parallax measurements, we develop spectrophotometric\nrelations to estimate distances to the other L dwarfs. Of the 67 new\ndiscoveries, 21 have photometric distances placing them within 25 parsecs of\nthe Sun. A table of all known L and T dwarfs believed to lie within 25 parsecs\n- 53 in total - is also presented. Using the distance measurement of the\ncoolest L dwarf known, we calculate that the gap in temperature between L8 and\nthe warmest known T dwarfs is less than 350K and probably much less. If the\ntransition region between the two classes spans a very small temperature\ninterval, this would explain why no transition objects have yet been uncovered.\nThis evidence, combined with model fits to low-resolution spectra of late-M and\nearly-L dwarfs, indicates that L dwarfs span the range 1300K < Teff < 2000K.",

    "summary": "A theoretical light curve is constructed for the quiescent phase of the\nrecurrent nova U Scorpii in order to resolve the existing distance discrepancy\nbetween the outbursts (6 kpc) and the quiescences (14 kpc). Our U Sco model\nconsists of a very massive white dwarf (WD), an accretion disk (ACDK) with a\nflaring-up rim, and a lobe-filling, slightly evolved, main-sequence star (MS).\nThe model properly includes an accretion luminosity of the WD, a viscous\nluminosity of the ACDK, a reflection effect of the MS and the ACDK irradiated\nby the WD photosphere. The B light curve is well reproduced by a model of 1.37\nM_sun WD + 1.5 M_sun MS (0.8---2.0 M_sun MS is acceptable) with an ACDK having\na flaring-up rim, and the inclination angle i~80 degree. The calculated color\nis rather blue (B-V~0.0) for a suggested mass accretion rate of 2.5 x 10^{-7}\nM_sun yr^{-1}, thus indicating a large color excess of E(B-V)~0.56 with the\nobservational color of B-V=0.56 in quiescence. Such a large color excess\ncorresponds to an absorption of A_V~1.8 and A_B~2.3, which reduces the distance\nto 6-8 kpc. This is in good agreement with the distance estimation of 4-6 kpc\nfor the latest outburst. Such a large intrinsic absorption is very consistent\nwith the recently detected period change of U Sco, which is indicating a mass\noutflow of ~3 x 10^{-7} M_sun yr^{-1} through the outer Lagrangian points in\nquiescence.",

In\naddition, we find a natural connection to non-rotating and spherical accretion\nwith turbulent viscosity, which is assumed to persist even without differential\nrotation. Positive Bernoulli numbers for advection-dominated accretion allow a\nfraction of the gas to be expelled in an outflow and the upper limit on the\nviscosity predicts that outflows are inevitable for equations of state close to\nan ideal gas.",

The resulting temperature and luminosity\nmeasurements of these bins, which occupy a region of the high redshift L-T\nrelation not previously sampled, are compared to existing measurements at low\nredshift in order to constrain the evolution of the L-T relation.

Specifically, probability distributions have\nthe following properties: (i) They are not Gaussian and their center is well\nadjusted by Levy distributions. (ii) They are long-tailed but have finite\nmoments of any order. (iii) They are self-similar on many time scales. Finally,\n(iv) at small time scales, price volatility follows a non-diffusive behavior.\nWe extend Merton's ideas on speculative price formation and present a dynamical\nmodel resulting in a characteristic function that explains in a natural way all\nof the above features. The knowledge of such distribution opens a new and\nuseful way of quantifying financial risk.

We use observations of 4 LMC HII regions whose\nionizing stars have classifications ranging from O7 to WN3. We assume a 2-zone\nT_e structure to compute ionic abundances. We compare with photoionization\nmodels tailored to the properties of the individual objects, and emphasize the\nimportance of correctly relating T_e in the two zones, which can otherwise\ncause errors of ~0.2 dex in abundance estimates. There are no spatial\nvariations to within 0.1 - 0.15 dex in any of the objects, even one hosting 3\nWR stars.\n  Our data agree with the modeled R23 and S23 diagnostics of O and S. We\npresent the first theoretical tracks for S23, which are in excellent agreement\nwith a larger dataset. However, contrary to earlier suggestions, S23 is much\nmore sensitive to the ionization parameter than is R23, because S23 does not\nsample S IV. We therefore introduce S234 = ([SII]+[SIII]+[SIV])/H-beta.\nPredicted and observed spatial variations in S234 are dramatically reduced in\ncontrast to S23. The intensity of [SIV]10.5 microns is easily estimated from a\nsimple relation between [SIV]/[SIII] and [OIII]/[OII]. This method of\nestimating S234 yields excellent agreement with our models, hence we give a\ntheoretical calibration for S234. The double-valued structure of S23 and S234\nremains an important problem as for R23, and presently we consider the S\ndiagnostics reliable only at Z < 0.5 Z_sol. However, the slightly larger\ndynamic range and excellent compatibility with theoretical predictions suggest\nthe S diagnostics to be more effective abundance indicators than R23.",

The H and K images with resolutions between 70mas and 92mas consist of\nseveral compact components within a 0.2\" radius and a fainter asymmetric\nnebula. The brightest four components are denoted with A to D in the order of\ndecreasing brightness in the 1996 image. A comparison of our images from 1995,\n1996, 1997, and 1998 gives - almost like a movie of five frames - insight into\nthe dynamical evolution of the inner nebula. For instance, the separation of\nthe two brightest components A and B increased from 191 mas in 1995 to 265 mas\nin 1998. At the same time, component B is fading and the components C and D\nbecome brighter. The X-shaped bipolar structure of the nebula, most prominently\npresent in the J-band image, implies an asymmetric mass loss. Such asymmetries\nare often present in protoplanetary nebulae but are unexpected for AGB stars.\nIRC +10216 is thus likely to be very advanced in its AGB evolution, shortly\nbefore turning into a protoplanetary nebula. The cometary shapes of A in the H\nand J images and in the 0.79 micron and 1.06 micron HST images suggest that the\ncore of A is not the central star, but the southern lobe of a bipolar\nstructure. The position of the central star is probably at or near the position\nof component B, where the H-K color has a value of 4.2.

In\norder to investigate the latter, and also to refer our calibration to a known\nmetallicity zero-point, we restrict our sample of red clump calibrators to\nthose with abundances derived from high-resolution spectroscopic data.

We\nthen compare our simulations to deep VLT observations of the cluster\nMS1008--1224 and propose to constrain the mass profile of the cluster as well\nas the ellipticity and the orientation of the mass distribution.

Using starburst models which incorporate time\nevolution, new stellar atmosphere models for massive stars, and a starburst\nmodel geometry derived from observations of the prototypical starburst M82, we\nmodel the integrated mid-infrared line ratio [NeIII](15.6 microns)/[NeII](12.8\nmicrons). This line ratio is sensitive to the hardness of the stellar energy\ndistribution and therefore to the most massive stars present.\n  We conclude from our models, with consideration of recent determinations of\nthe stellar census in local, high-mass star forming regions, that the\n[NeIII]/[NeII] ratios we measure are consistent with the formation of massive\n(~50-100 solar mass) stars in most starbursts. In this framework, the low\nnebular excitation inferred from the measured line ratios can be attributed to\naging effects. By including estimates of the ratio of infrared-to-Lyman\ncontinuum luminosity for the galaxies in our sample, we further find that most\nstarbursts are relatively short-lived (1-10 million years), only a few O-star\nlifetimes.

We show that the perturbation\nequations can always be written in terms of spacetime variables only,\nregardless of any particular gauge. We demonstrate how to obtain the\nRegge-Wheeler gauge, by choosing appropriate lapse and shift. In addition, not\nonly the 3-metric but also the extrinsic curvature of the initial slice have to\nsatisfy certain conditions in order to preserve the Regge-Wheeler gauge\nthroughout the evolution.

An interesting phenomenon occurs in very compact\nstars, where the first ring-down phase in the wave signal corresponds to the\nfirst quasinormal mode of an equal mass black hole, rather than to one of the\nproper quasinormal modes of the stellar model. A somewhat heuristic explanation\nto account for this phenomenon is given. For realistic equations of state, the\nnumerical evolutions exhibit an instability, which does not occur for\npolytropic equations of state.

These coefficients depend nonlinearly on the shear rate. The\nsimulation results are compared with theoretical predictions given by the Grad\nmethod and the BGK and the ellipsoidal statistical (ES) models. It is found\nthat the kinetic models present a good agreement with the simulation,\nespecially in the case of the ES model, while the Grad method is only\nqualitatively reliable for the momentum transport. In addition, the velocity\ndistribution function is also measured and compared with the BGK and ES\ndistributions.",

The scenario is: (i) at the last stage of incomplete\ncollapse of the bubble the gradient of pressure in water near the bubble\nsurface has such a value and sign that the electric field arising from the\nflexoelectric effect exceeds the threshold field of the dynamic electrical\nbreakdown of water and is directed to the bubble center; (ii) mobile electrons\nare generated because of thermal ionization of water molecules near the bubble\nsurface; (iii) these electrons are accelerated in ''cold'' water by the strong\nelectric fields; (iv) these hot electrons transfer noble gas atoms dissolved in\nwater to high-energy excited states and optical transitions between these\nstates produce SBSL UV flashes in the trasparency window of water; (v) the\nbreakdown can be repeated several times and the power and duration of the UV\nflash are determined by the multiplicity of the breakdowns.

Some 320 galaxies were surveyed, of\nwhich 116 were detected in emission (39% of spirals, 75% of peculiars).\nDetected emission was classified as `compact' or `diffuse'. From an analysis of\nthe full survey sample, we reconfirm our previous identification of compact and\ndiffuse emission with circumnuclear starburst and disk emission respectively.\nThe circumnuclear emission is associated either with the presence of a bar, or\nwith a disturbed galaxy morphology indicative of on-going tidal interactions.\nThe frequency of such tidally-induced (circumnuclear) starburst emission in\nspirals increases from regions of lower to higher local galaxy surface density,\nand from clusters with lower to higher central galaxy space density. We\nconclude that tidal interactions are likely to be the main mechanism for the\ntransformation of spirals to S0s in clusters. Finally, for regions of\ncomparable local density, the frequency of tidally-induced starburst emission\nis greater in clusters with higher central galaxy density. This implies that,\nfor a given local density, morphological transformation of disk galaxies\nproceeds more rapidly in clusters of higher central galaxy density. This effect\nis considered to be due to subcluster merging and could account for the\npreviously considered anomalous absence of a significant type - local surface\ndensity relation for irregular clusters at intermediate redshift.",

In the auxiliary-field\nmethod, the L-slice approximant to the density matrix can be evaluated as a\nfunction of inverse temperature at any finite L as\n$\\rho_L(\\beta)=[\\rho_1(\\beta/L)]^L$, if the density matrix $\\rho_1(\\beta)$ in\nthe static approximation is known. We investigate the convergence of the\npartition function $Z_L(\\beta)=Tr\\rho_L(\\beta)$, the internal energy and the\ndensity of states $g_L(E)$ (the inverse Laplace transform of $Z_L$), as\n$L\\to\\infty$. For the simple harmonic oscillator, $g_L(E)$ is a normalized\ntruncated Fourier series for the exact density of states. When the\nauxiliary-field approach is applied to spin systems, approximants to the\ndensity of states and heat capacity can be negative. Approximants to the\ndensity matrix for a spin-1/2 dimer are found in closed form for all L by\nappending a self-interaction to the divergent Gaussian integral and\nanalytically continuing to zero self-interaction. Because of this continuation,\nthe coefficient of the singlet projector in the approximate density matrix can\nbe negative. For a spin dimer, $Z_L$ is an even function of the coupling\nconstant for L<3: ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic coupling can be\ndistinguished only for $L\\ge 3$, where a Berry phase appears in the functional\nintegral. At any non-zero temperature, the exact partition function is\nrecovered as $L\\to\\infty$.",

The analysis predicts a bifurcation (with increasing forcing) from\nrotating four-phase spirals to standing two-phase patterns. This bifurcation is\nalso found in periodically forced reaction-diffusion equations, the\nFitzHugh-Nagumo and Brusselator models, even far from the onset of oscillations\nwhere the amplitude equation analysis is not strictly valid.

This enables the comparison of\nthe ellipticity of the mass distribution with that of the light in galaxies, as\nwell as an estimate of the degree of alignment between the stellar component\nand dark matter.

The prospects for applying this technique are excellent with large\non-going surveys like the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The expected signal is\nsmaller, but comparable in significance to that of the mass in standard\ngalaxy-galaxy lensing analyses.

A few\nof them, viz., PTI, NPOI, IOTA are producing results. Among the working\ninterferometers that have been described earlier by Saha (1999a), the expansion\nof the Grand interf\\'erom\\`etre \\`a deux (two) t\\'elescopes (GI2T), Infrared\nand optical telescope array (IOTA) are in progress. The current status of all\nthese interferometers stated above are enumerated. The data analysis being\ncarried out using the working interferometers are also described. The space\ninterferometry programmes are advancing very fast. Among the notable ones are\nthe Space technology 3 (ST3), Space interferometry mission (SIM), and Darwin;\nthey have already received funds. The technical details of these\ninterferometers and their objectives are highlighted.",

I note a change in\nobjective which occurred around 1990, with the new emphasis being USING the b\nquark, to probe the Standard Model and to search for physics `beyond the\nStandard Model'. I review the flavor sector of the Standard Model, showing why\nthe b quark is such a useful probe.

Instability occurs for scales larger than\nthe largest Schwarz scale rather than only for scales larger than the acoustic\nscale introduced by Jeans 1902.

It is already known that weak lensing\ncan constrain the background geometry of the Universe, but we further show that\nit can also provide valuable information about the statistics of collapsed\nobjects and the physics of collisionless clustering. Our results are\nparticularly important for future observations which will, at least initially,\nfocus on small smoothing angles.",

    "summary": "The possibility that strongly correlated many-electron systems may exhibit\nspin-charge separation has generated great excitement, particularly in the\nlight of recent experiments on low dimensional conductors and high temperature\nsuperconductors. However, finding experimental support for this hypothesis has\nbeen made difficult by the fact that most commonly used probes couple\nsimultaneously to spin and charge excitations. We argue that core hole\nphotoemission (XPS)/nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) couple independently and\nin exactly comparable ways to the local charge/spin susceptibilities of the\nsystem being measured. The explicit comparison of XPS and NMR data,\nparticularly in systems which exhibit a pseudogap, may therefore yield fresh\nevidence for the existence (or non-existence) of spin-charge separation.\nApplication of these ideas to the normal state of high temperature\nsuperconductors is discussed, and the application is further illustrated in\nsome detail for quasi one-dimensional systems with charge density waves.",

We address this question in the mathematical\nframework of marked point processes and clarify the notion of luminosity and\nmorphological segregation. A number of test quantities such as conditional\nmark-weighted two-point correlation functions are introduced. These descriptors\nallow for a scale-dependent analysis of luminosity and morphology segregation.\nMoreover, they break the degeneracy between an inhomogeneous fractal point set\nand actual present luminosity segregation. Using the Southern Sky Redshift\nSurvey~2 (da Costa et al. 1998, SSRS2) we find both luminosity and\nmorphological segregation at a high level of significance, confirming claims by\nprevious works using these data (Benoist et al. 1996, Willmer et al. 1998).\nSpecifically, the average luminosity and the fluctuations in the luminosity of\npairs of galaxies are enhanced out to separations of 15Mpc/h. On scales smaller\nthan 3Mpc/h the luminosities on galaxy pairs show a tight correlation. A\ncomparison with the random-field model indicates that galaxy luminosities\ndepend on the spatial distribution and galaxy-galaxy interactions. Early-type\ngalaxies are also more strongly correlated, indicating morphological\nsegregation. The galaxies in the PSCz catalog (Saunders et al. 2000) do not\nshow significant luminosity segregation. This again illustrates that mainly\nearly-type galaxies contribute to luminosity segregation. However, based on\nseveral independent investigations we show that the observed luminosity\nsegregation can not be explained by the morphology-density relation alone.",

This\nbehavior is readily explicable via a physical model whose basic premises are:\n(a) the transition at L_H\\alpha = L_Str marks a change from essentially\nionization bounding at low luminosities to density bounding at higher values,\n(b) for this to occur the law relating stellar mass in massive star-forming\nclouds to the mass of the placental cloud must be such that the ionizing photon\nflux produced within the cloud is a function which rises more steeply than the\nmass of the cloud. Supporting evidence for the hypothesis of this transition is\npresented. If confirmed, the density-bounding hypothesis would imply that the\ndensity-bounded regions were the main sources of the photons which ionize the\ndiffuse gas in disk galaxies. We estimate that these regions emit sufficient\nLyman continuum not only to ionize the diffuse medium, but to cause a typical\nspiral to emit significant ionizing flux into the intergalactic medium. The low\nscatter observed in L_Str, less than 0.1 mag rms in the still quite small\nsample measured to date, is an invitation to widen the data base, and to\ncalibrate against primary standards, with the aim of obtaining a precise\nstandard candle.",

Such a mechanism\nrequires a high angular momentum in the progenitor object. The observed\nassociation of gamma-ray bursts with type Ibc supernovae leads us to consider\nmassive helium stars that form black holes at the end of their lives as\nprogenitors. We combine the numerical work of MacFadyen & Woosley with analytic\ncalculations, to show that about 1E53 erg each are available to drive the fast\nGRB ejecta and the supernova. The GRB ejecta are driven by the power output\nthrough the open field lines, whereas the supernova is powered by closed filed\nlines and jet shocks. We also present a much simplified approximate derivation\nof these energetics.\n  Helium stars that leave massive black-hole remnants in special ways, namely\nvia soft X-ray transients or very massive WNL stars. Since binaries naturally\nhave high angular momentum, we propose a link between black-hole transients and\ngamma-ray bursts. Recent observations of one such transient, GRO J1655-40/Nova\nScorpii 1994, explicitly support this connection: its high space velocity\nindicates that substantial mass was ejected in the formation of the black hole,\nand the overabundance of alpha-nuclei, especially sulphur, indicates that the\nexplosion energy was extreme, as in SN 1998bw/GRB 980425.

We make the assumption that such variability is caused\nby the presence of regions of enhanced density, i.e. blobs, in their envelopes.\nIn order to find the physical characteristics of such regions we have modeled\nthe stellar emission using a Monte Carlo code to treat the radiative transfer\nin an inhomogeneous electron scattering envelope. We are able to treat multiple\nscattering in the regions of enhanced density as well as in the envelope\nitself. The finite sizes of the source and structures in the wind are also\ntaken into account. Most of the results presented here are based on a parameter\nstudy of models with a single blob. The effects due to multiple blobs in the\nenvelope are considered to a more limited extent. Our simulations indicate that\nthe density enhancements must have a large geometric cross section in order to\nproduce the observed photopolarimetric variability. The sizes must be of the\norder of one stellar radius and the blobs must be located near the base of the\nenvelope. These sizes are the same inferred from the widths of the sub-peaks in\noptical emission lines of Wolf-Rayet stars. Other early-type stars show random\npolarimetric fluctuations with characteristics similar to those observed in\nWolf-Rayet stars, which may also be interpreted in terms of a clumpy wind.\nAlthough the origin of such structures is still unclear, the same mechanism may\nbe working in different types of hot stars envelopes to produce such\ninhomogeneities.",

With MSSM matter and SUSY breaking\nfields localized on separate branes in an extra dimension of size R \\sim 5\nM^{-1}_{Pl} (in which gauge fields propagate), the SUGRA contribution to\nsfermion masses (which violates flavor) is suppressed. As in 4 dimensions, MSSM\ngauginos acquire {\\em non}-universal masses from both SUGRA and GM - gaugino\nmasses (in particular the SUGRA contribution to gaugino masses), in turn,\ngenerate acceptable sfermion masses through RG evolution; the phenomenology is\ndiscussed briefly.

To enhance the dynamic range of these large\nsimulations, we use the synthetic halo replacement technique of Ma & Fry\n(2000a), where the original halos with numerically softened cores are replaced\nby synthetic halos of realistic density profiles. At high wavenumbers, our\nmodel predicts a slope for the nonlinear power spectrum different from the\noften-used fitting formulas in the literature based on the stable clustering\nassumption. Our model also predicts a three-point amplitude Q that is scale\ndependent, in contrast to the popular hierarchical clustering assumption. This\nmodel provides a rapid way to compute the mass power spectrum and bispectrum\nover all length scales where the input halo properties are valid. It also\nprovides a physical interpretation of the clustering properties of matter in\nthe universe.",

The periodic table is derived from\ndimensional hierarchy for the seven extra spatial dimensions. As a molecule is\nthe composite of atoms with chemical bonds, a hadron is the composite of\nelementary particles with hadronic bonds. The masses of elementary particles\nand hadrons can be calculated using the periodic table with only four known\nconstants: the number of the extra spatial dimensions in the superstring, the\nmass of electron, the mass of Z=B0, and the fine structure constant. The\ncalculated masses are in good agreement with the observed values. For examples,\nthe calculated masses for the top quark, neutron, and pion are 176.5 GeV,\n939.54MeV, and 135.01MeV in excellent agreement with the observed masses, 176\n=B1 13 GeV, 939.57 MeV, and 134.98 MeV, respectively. The masses of 110 hadrons\nare calculated. The overall average difference between the calculated masses\nand the observed masses for all hadrons is 0.29 MeV. The periodic table of\nelementary particles provides the most comprehensive explanation and\ncalculation for the masses of elementary particles and hadrons.",

    "summary": "There are at present more then 30 theories about the origin of cosmic\nmagnetic fields at galactic and intergalactic scales. Most of them rely on\nconcepts of elementary particle physics, like phase transitions in the early\nUniverse, string theory and processes during the inflationary epoch. Here we\npresent some more astrophysical arguments to provide some guidance through this\nlarge number and variety of models. Especially the fact that the evolution of\nmagnetic fields depends on the spatial coherence scale of the fields leds to\nsome interesting conclusions, which may rule out the majority of the\ntheoretical scenarios. In principle one has to distinguish between the\nlarge-scale and small-scale magnetic fields. Large scale fields are defined as\nthose as becoming sub-horizon at that redshift at which the mass energy density\nbecomes equal to the photon energy density, which we name as equality. Small\nscale fields which are sub-horizon even before equality, i.e. with scales lower\nthan (present) few Mpc cannot survive the radiation era and cannot reach\nrecombination, because of the effects of magnetic diffusion and photon\ndiffusion. Therefore mechanisms based on phase transitions become unlike, as\nthey provide magnetic fields on scales smaller than the horizon. Thus, the\nobserved galactic and intergalactic fields, which are small scales in our\nterminology must be created after recombination by normal plasma processes\nduring the protogalactic evolution. The large scale fields instead were\nproduced during inflation and may have noticeable implications for the\nformation of the large scale structure of the Universe. The inclusion of large\nscale magnetic fields may improve present Cold Dark Matter theories of\nstructure formation.",

The\nnotion of space-time naturally arises as a homogeneous space associated with\nthe kinematical (non-dynamical) SL(2,R) symmetry in the kernel of the\nLie-algebra central extension for the critical values of the conformal anomaly.\nThe rest of the generators in the group, L_n (n>1, n<-1), mix space-times with\ndifferent constant curvature. Only in the classical limit all space-times can\nbe identified, defining a unique Minkowski space-time, and the operators L_n\n(n<1, n<-1) gauged away. This process entails a restriction to SL(2,R)\nsubrepresentations, which creates a non-trivial two-dimensional symplectic\nclassical phase space. The present model thus suggests that the role of general\ncovariance in quantum gravity is different from that played in the classical\nlimit.",

Here\ncertain new, recursively known coefficients enter, which are closely related to\nbut different from the coefficients of the formal solutions at one of the\nirregular singular points of the differential equation.

As a by-product, the leading exponential terms of the asymptotic\nbehaviour of the late coefficients of the formal solutions are given, and this\nis a concrete example of the structural results obtained by Immink in a more\ngeneral setting.

Only states within the same or neighboring classes are coupled. We\nassume that the density of states per class grows monotonically with class\nindex. The problem is mapped onto a one-dimensional non-linear sigma model. In\nthe limit of a large number of states in each class we derive the critical\nexponent for the growth of the level density with class index for which\ndelocalization sets in. From a realistic modelling of the class-dependence of\nthe level density, we conclude that the model does not predict Fock-space\nlocalization in nuclei.",

To this end we explain first how one can\ncompute on constraint satisfaction problems using rules represented by simple\nfirst-order formulas. Then we consider constraint satisfaction problems that\nare based on predefined, explicitly given constraints. To solve them we first\nderive rules from these explicitly given constraints and limit the computation\nprocess to a repeated application of these rules, combined with labeling.We\nconsider here two types of rules. The first type, that we call equality rules,\nleads to a new notion of local consistency, called {\\em rule consistency} that\nturns out to be weaker than arc consistency for constraints of arbitrary arity\n(called hyper-arc consistency in \\cite{MS98b}). For Boolean constraints rule\nconsistency coincides with the closure under the well-known propagation rules\nfor Boolean constraints. The second type of rules, that we call membership\nrules, yields a rule-based characterization of arc consistency. To show\nfeasibility of this rule-based approach to constraint programming we show how\nboth types of rules can be automatically generated, as {\\tt CHR} rules of\n\\cite{fruhwirth-constraint-95}. This yields an implementation of this approach\nto programming by means of constraint logic programming. We illustrate the\nusefulness of this approach to constraint programming by discussing various\nexamples, including Boolean constraints, two typical examples of many valued\nlogics, constraints dealing with Waltz's language for describing polyhedral\nscenes, and Allen's qualitative approach to temporal logic.",

At large times, the\nsolution is dominated by a decaying positive cosmological term, with negative\npressure, and necessarily describes a quasi-flat universe if the energy\nconditions have to be satisfied. The absence of closed time-like curves\nrequires a superior limit for the global angular velocity, which appears as a\nnatural explanation for the observed smallness of the present rotation.

The magnitudes of the host (R = 21.9, V = 22.5)\nand optical afterglow (R = 25.4, V = 25.8, 47.7 days after the burst) favor a\nscenario where the optical light follows a pure power-law decay with an index\nof alpha ~ -1.0.

Propositional logic is, arguably, the simplest ASP system with\nan intuitive semantics supporting direct modeling of problem constraints.\nHowever, for some applications, especially those requiring that transitive\nclosure be computed, it requires additional variables and results in large\ntheories. Consequently, it may not be a practical computational tool for such\nproblems. On the other hand, ASP systems based on nonmonotonic logics, such as\nstable logic programming, can handle transitive closure computation efficiently\nand, in general, yield very concise theories as problem representations. Their\nsemantics is, however, more complex. Searching for the middle ground, in this\npaper we introduce a new nonmonotonic logic, DATALOG with constraints or DC.\nInformally, DC theories consist of propositional clauses (constraints) and of\nHorn rules. The semantics is a simple and natural extension of the semantics of\nthe propositional logic. However, thanks to the presence of Horn rules in the\nsystem, modeling of transitive closure becomes straightforward. We describe the\nsyntax and semantics of DC, and study its properties. We discuss an\nimplementation of DC and present results of experimental study of the\neffectiveness of DC, comparing it with CSAT, a satisfiability checker and\nSMODELS implementation of stable logic programming. Our results show that DC is\ncompetitive with the other two approaches, in case of many search problems,\noften yielding much more efficient solutions.",

This\nis a generalization of previous formulations to include a density gradient in\nthe pre-shock ambient medium, as well as anisotropy in the pre-shock wind. For\ncases where the wind is unaccelerated, the formalism yields exact, analytic\nsolutions.\n  Solutions are presented for two bow shock cases: (1) that due to a star\nmoving supersonically with respect to an ambient medium with a density gradient\nperpendicular to the stellar velocity, and (2) that due to a star with a\nmisaligned, axisymmetric wind moving in a uniform medium. It is also shown\nunder quite general circumstances that the total rate of energy thermalization\nin the bow shock is independent of the details of the wind asymmetry, including\nthe orientation of the non-axisymmetric driving wind, provided the wind is\nnon-accelerating and point-symmetric. A typical feature of the solutions is\nthat the region near the standoff point is tilted, so that the star does not\nlie along the bisector of a parabolic fit to the standoff region.

The\ndirection of angular momentum transport in stirred particle and fluid disks is\ndetermined by the direction of external stirring and by the properties of the\ncollision term in the Boltzmann equation (or its analogue in the fluid\nproblem). In particular, our model problem yields inward transport for\nvertically or radially stirred disks, provided collisions are suitably\ninelastic; the transport is outwards in the elastic limit. Numerical\nsimulations of hydrodynamic turbulence driven by thermal convection find inward\ntransport; this requires that fluctuating pressure forces do little to no work,\nand is analogous to an externally stirred particle disk in which collisions are\nhighly inelastic.",

The resulting slope of the decay is\n0.97+/-0.05 and the magnitudes of the underlying galaxy are: V = 22.3 +/- 0.05,\nR = 21.75 +/- 0.05 and I = 21.35 +/- 0.05. Second, the additional component was\nassumed to be a galaxy plus an underlying supernova with a time-variable\nbrightness identical to that of GRB980425, appropriately scaled to the redshift\nof GRB990712. The resulting slope of the decay is similar, but the\ngoodness-of-fit is worse which would imply that either this GRB is not\nassociated with an underlying supernova or the underlying supernova is much\nfainter than the supernova associated with GRB980425. The galaxy in this case\nis fainter: V = 22.7 +/- 0.05, R = 22.25 +/- 0.05 and I = 22.15 +/- 0.05; and\nthe OT plus the underlying supernova at a given time is brighter. Measurements\nof the brightnesses of the OT and the galaxy by late-time HST observation and\nground-based observations can thus assess the presence of an underlying\nsupernova.",

    "summary": "Recent studies of nearby spiral galaxies suggest that photodissociation\nregions (PDRs) are capable of producing much of the observed HI in galaxy\ndisks. In that case, measurements of the HI column density and the\nfar-ultraviolet (FUV) photon flux provide a new probe of the volume density of\nthe local underlying H_2. We develop the method and apply it to the giant Scd\nspiral M101 (NGC 5457). We find that, after correction for the best-estimate\ngradient of metallicity in the ISM of M101 and for the extinction of the\nultraviolet emission, molecular gas with a narrow range of density from 30-1000\ncm^-3 is found near star- forming regions at all radii in the disk of M101 out\nto a distance of 12' (approximately 26 kpc), close to the photometric limit of\nR_25 = 13.5'.\n  In this picture, the ISM is virtually all molecular in the inner parts of\nM101. The strong decrease of the HI column density in the inner disk of the\ngalaxy at R_G < 10 kpc is a consequence of a strong increase in the dust-to-gas\nratio there, resulting in an increase of the H_2 formation rate on grains and a\ncorresponding disappearance of hydrogen in its atomic form.",

The\ndistribution of radial velocities implies a configuration of these stars as a\nsheet inclined at 73+/-4 degrees to the plane of the sky. The near side, to the\nSouth, is dominated by a stellar component; to the North, the far side contains\nfewer carbon stars, and is dominated by the neutral gas. The upper velocity\nenvelope of the stars is closely the same as that of the gas. This\nconfiguration is shown to be consistent with the known extension of the SMC\nalong the line of sight, and is attributed to a tidally induced disruption of\nthe SMC that originated in a close encounter with the LMC some 0.3 to 0.4 Gyr\nago. The dearth of gas on the near side of the sheet is attributed to ablation\nprocesses akin to those inferred by Weiner & Williams (1996) to collisional\nexcitation of the leading edges of Magellanic Stream clouds. Comparison with\npre LMC/SMC encounter kinematic data of Hardy, Suntzeff, & Azzopardi (1989) of\ncarbon stars, with data of stars formed after the encounter, of Maurice et al.\n(1989), and Mathewson et al.

It allows us to\nconsider both charge and energy {\\it dispersive} transport. The method is based\non the idea of quasi-elasticity: the typical energy loss during a hop is much\nless than all other characteristic energies. We have investigated two models\nwith different density of states energy dependencies with our method. In\ngeneral, we have found that the motion of a packet in energy space is affected\nby two competing tendencies. First, there is a packet broadening, i.e. the\ndispersive energy transport. Second, there is a narrowing of the packet, if the\ndensity of states is depleting with decreasing energy. It is the interplay of\nthese two tendencies that determines the overall evolution. If the density of\nstates is constant, only broadening exists. In this case a packet in energy\nspace evolves into Gaussian one, moving with constant drift velocity and mean\nsquare deviation increasing linearly in time. If the density of states depletes\nexponentially with decreasing energy, the motion of the packet tremendously\nslows down with time. For large times the mean square deviation of the packet\nbecomes constant, so that the motion of the packet is ``soliton-like''.",

We\nargue that a high luminosity, 600 GeV e+e- collider would then be the natural\nchoice to feel confident about finding and studying states connected to\nelectroweak symmetry breaking. We also argue from the data that worrying about\nresonances at multi-TeV energies as the only signal for electroweak symmetry\nbreaking is not as important a discovery issue for the next generation of\ncolliders. Such concerns should perhaps be replaced with more relevant\ndiscovery issues such as a Higgs boson that decays invisibly, and ``new\nphysics'' that could conspire with a heavier Higgs boson to accommodate\nprecision electroweak data. An e+e- collider with energy less than about 600\nGeV is ideally suited to cover these possibilities.",

Various\nfeatures of the model which gives remarkably accurate results for the quark and\nlepton masses and mixings were presented earlier in separate publications. The\nconstruction of the matrices is first discussed in the framework of effective\noperators, from which one naturally obtains the maximal \\nu_\\mu - \\nu_\\tau\nmixing, while the small angle or maximal mixing solutions for the solar\nneutrinos depend upon the nature of the Majorana matrix. A set of Higgs and\nfermion superfields is then introduced from which the Higgs and Yukawa\nsuperpotentials uniquely give the structure of the mass matrices previously\nobtained. The right-handed Majorana matrix arises from one Higgs field coupling\nto several pairs of superheavy conjugate neutrino singlets. For the simple\nversion considered, 10 input parameters accurately yield the 20 masses and\nmixings of the quarks and leptons, and the 3 masses of the right-handed\nneutrinos.",

(1999) reported an upper limit on the degree of linear\npolarization of the optical afterglow for this burst (P <2.3%). One of the\ninterprtations for this small value of P was that the emission was probably due\na relativistic jet with ordered magnetic field, and the viewing angle in the\nlab frame theta' <= Gamma^{-1}, where Gamma is the bulk Lorentz factor of the\njet at the time of the optical emission. We point out that this conclusion\nresulted from a confusion between the angles measured in the lab frame and in\nthe plasma rest frame. For ordered magnetic field, one would actually obtain a\nlarge value of P because the above mentioned angle would correspond to a very\nlarge angle, theta <= \\pi/2, in the plasma rest frame. And this is probably the\ncase with the blazars. On the other hand, it is indeed possible to have P ~ 0\nif the magnetic field of GRB 990123 was completely chaotic and the viewing\nangle was considerably smaller than the semi-angle of the jet.",

We have\nsuggested various variables of the neutral and charged current events that can\nbe used to study this effect. In particular the ratio of charged to neutral\ncurrent events can be used at early times while the ratio of the energy moments\nfor the charged to the neutral current events can form useful diagnostic tools\neven at late times to study neutrino mass and mixing.",

We show how this gives rise to Abelian instantons and identify them with\nSU(2)-instantons of Pontryagin number 2n^2 found by Charap and Duff in 1977.\nUsing results of Dodziuk and Hitchin we also calculate the full L^2 harmonic\nspace for the Euclidean Schwarzschild manifold.",

This analysis is\nstraightforward extension of the preceding work [cond-mat/9909277], where only\nthe $X$ term is considered as a site-off-diagonal term.

But in more than two dimensions they have rather delicate domain\nproperties in the presence of interaction. If, for example, they are defined\nand temperate on a translation-invariant, dense domain, then the underlying\ntheory yields only trivial scattering.

Our starting point is the\nquasi-geostrophic 1-1/2 layer model, and we consider the relevant limit of a\nsmall Rossby radius of deformation. Then narrow jets are obtained, scaling like\nthe Rossby radius of deformation. These jets can be either zonal, or closed\ninto a ring bounding a vortex. Taking into account the effect of the beta\neffect and a sublayer deep shear flow, we predict an organization of the\nturbulent atmospheric layer into an oval-shaped vortex amidst a background\nshear. Such an isolated vortex is centered over an extremum of the equivalent\ntopography (determined by the deep shear flow and beta-effect). This prediction\nis in agreement with analysis of wind data in major Jovian vortices (Great Red\nSpot and Oval BC).",

We find that the\nmagnetic fields are amplified through field line stretching at a rate\nproportional to the difference between the velocity and the magnetic field\nstrength times a constant. Equipartition between the kinetic and magnetic\nenergy densities occurs at a scale somewhat smaller than the kinetic energy\npeak.

At the equipartition scale the\nmagnetic fields show only a moderate degree of anisotropy, so that the typical\nradius of curvature of field lines is comparable to the typical perpendicular\nscale for field reversal. In other words, there are few field reversals within\neddies at the equipartition scale, and no fine-grained series of reversals at\nsmaller scales. At scales below the equipartition scale, both velocity and\nmagnetic structures are anisotropic; the eddies are stretched along the local\nmagnetic field lines, and the magnetic energy dominates the kinetic energy on\nthe same scale by a factor which increases at higher wavenumbers.

    "summary": "The standard model of Gamma-Ray Bursts afterglows is based on synchrotron\nradiation from a blast wave produced when the relativistic ejecta encounters\nthe surrounding medium. We reanalyze the refreshed shock scenario, in which\nslower material catches up with the decelerating ejecta and reenergizes it.\nThis energization can be done either continuously or in discrete episodes. We\nshow that such scenario has two important implications. First there is an\nadditional component coming from the reverse shock that goes into the\nenergizing ejecta. This persists for as long as the re-energization itself,\nwhich could extend for up to days or longer. We find that during this time the\noverall spectral peak is found at the characteristic frequency of the reverse\nshock. Second, if the injection is continuous, the dynamics will be different\nfrom that in constant energy evolution, and will cause a slower decline of the\nobserved fluxes. A simple test of the continuously refreshed scenario is that\nit predicts a spectral maximum in the far IR or mm range after a few days.",

    "summary": "We consider the Maldacena conjecture applied to the near horizon geometry of\na D1-brane in the supergravity approximation and present numerical results of a\ntest of the conjecture against the boundary field theory calculation using\nDLCQ. We previously calculated the two-point function of the stress-energy\ntensor on the supergravity side; the methods of Gubser, Klebanov, Polyakov, and\nWitten were used. On the field theory side, we derived an explicit expression\nfor the two-point function in terms of data that may be extracted from the\nsupersymmetric discrete light cone quantization (SDLCQ) calculation at a given\nharmonic resolution. This yielded a well defined numerical algorithm for\ncomputing the two-point function. For the supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with\n16 supercharges that arises in the Maldacena conjecture, the algorithm is\nperfectly well defined; however, the size of the numerical computation\nprevented us from obtaining a numerical check of the conjecture. We now present\nnumerical results with approximately 1000 times as many states as we previously\nconsidered. These results support the Maldacena conjecture and are within\n$10-15%$ of the predicted numerical results in some regions. Our results are\nstill not sufficient to demonstrate convergence, and, therefore, cannot be\nconsidered to a numerical proof of the conjecture. We present a method for\nusing a ``flavor'' symmetry to greatly reduce the size of the basis and discuss\na numerical method that we use which is particularly well suited for this type\nof matrix element calculation.",

We prove that the\nprobability that the paths B[0,t] and B'[0,t] do not intersect decays like\nt^{-5/8}. More precisely, there is a constant c>0 such that if |B(0) - B'(0)|\n=1, for all t \\ge 1, c^{-1} t^{-5/8} \\le \\P[ B[0,t] \\cap B'[0,t] = \\emptyset ]\n\\le c t^{-5/8}.

Using an analyticity result, which is to be established in a\nforthcoming paper, it follows that the Hausdorff dimension of the outer\nboundary of B[0,1] is 4/3, as conjectured by Mandelbrot. The proofs are based\non a study of SLE_6 (stochastic Loewner evolution with parameter 6), a recently\ndiscovered process which conjecturally is the scaling limit of critical\npercolation cluster boundaries.

They also appear in related contexts, such as in lubricating\nfluids confined to ultra-thin molecular layers[7]. Detailed information on\nmotion within a shear band in a three-dimensional geometry, including the\ndegree of particle rotation and inter-particle slip, is lacking. Similarly,\nonly little is known about how properties of the individual grains - their\nmicrostructure - affect movement in densely packed material[5].

It is based on the Gutzwiller\napproximation which gives the renormalization of parameters, t and J, due to\nthe Gutzwiller's projection operator excluding the double occupancies. The\nfinite-range correlations are taken into account compared with the conventional\nGutzwiller approximation where only the on-site expectation values are\nconsidered. It is shown that the essential point of the renormalization is its\nnonlinear dependence on the expectation values of Cooper pairs and\nantiferromagnetic moment. In particular the renormalization factor of J becomes\nanisotropic in the presence of antiferromagnetic moment, i.e., that for the\nz-component is enhanced compared with that for the xy-component. The physical\norigin of this enhancement is identified as the surrounding antiferromagnetic\ncorrelations of a bond. The self-consistency equations for the uniform\nvariational wave functions are derived and solved numerically. Our result gives\na reasonable estimate of antiferromagnetic order parameters near half filling,\nin contrast to the conventional slave-boson mean-field theory and the original\nGutzwiller approximation. It is also found that, at half filling, the\nrenormalization of J represents some of the quantum fluctuations of the\nHeisenberg spin system in a different manner from the spin-wave theory.

While similar results have been obtained for Galactic\nPNe, this is the first demonstration of the relationship for extra-galactic\nPNe. We also examine the relation between morphology and abundance of the\nproducts of stellar evolution. We found that asymmetric PNe have higher\nnitrogen and lower carbon abundances than symmetric PNe. Our two main results\nare broadly consistent with the predictions of stellar evolution if the\nprogenitors of asymmetric PNe have on average larger masses than the\nprogenitors of symmetric PNe. The results bear on the question of formation\nmechanisms for asymmetric PNe, specifically, that the genesis of PNe structure\nshould relate strongly to the Population type, and by inference the mass, of\nthe progenitor star, and less strongly on whether the central star is a member\nof a close binary system.",

This suggests that the instanton saddle point saturates the\nnon-perturbative contribution to the functional integral. A natural framework\nin which corrections to this approximation are absent is given by the\ntopological field theory built out of the N=2 Super Yang-Mills theory. After\nextending the standard construction of the Topological Yang-Mills theory to\nencompass the case of a non-vanishing vacuum expectation value for the scalar\nfield, a BRST transformation is defined (as a supersymmetry plus a gauge\nvariation), which on the instanton moduli space is the exterior derivative. The\ntopological field theory approach makes the so-called \"constrained instanton\"\nconfigurations and the instanton measure arise in a natural way. As a\nconsequence, instanton-dominated Green's functions in N=2 Super Yang-Mills can\nbe equivalently computed either using the constrained instanton method or\nmaking reference to the topological twisted version of the theory. We\nexplicitly compute the instanton measure and the contribution to $u=<\\Tr\n\\phi^2>$ for winding numbers one and two. We then show that each\nnon-perturbative contribution to the N=2 low-energy effective action can be\nwritten as the integral of a total derivative of a function of the instanton\nmoduli. Only instanton configurations of zero conformal size contribute to this\nresult. Finally, the 8k-dimensional instanton moduli space is built using the\nhyperkahler quotient procedure, which clarifies the geometrical meaning of our\napproach.",

    "summary": "A new supersymmetric standard model based on N=1 supergravity is constructed,\naiming at natural explanation for the proton stability without invoking an ad\nhoc discrete symmetry through R parity. The proton is protected from decay by\nan extra U(1) gauge symmetry. Particle contents are necessarily increased to be\nfree from anomalies, making it possible to incorporate the superfields for\nright-handed neutrinos and an SU(2)-singlet Higgs boson. The vacuum expectation\nvalue of this Higgs boson, which induces spontaneous breakdown of the U(1)\nsymmetry, yields large Majorana masses for the right-handed neutrinos, leading\nto small masses for the ordinary neutrinos. The linear coupling of\nSU(2)-doublet Higgs superfields, which is indispensable to the superpotential\nof the minimal supersymmetric standard model, is replaced by a trilinear\ncoupling of the Higgs superfields, so that there is no mass parameter in the\nsuperpotential. The energy dependencies of the model parameters are studied,\nshowing that gauge symmetry breaking is induced by radiative corrections.\nCertain ranges of the parameter values compatible with phenomena at the\nelectroweak energy scale can be derived from universal values of masses-squared\nand trilinear coupling constants for scalar fields at a very high energy scale.",

Our data includes direct measurements of the\nspatial structure of the sources, in which we look for departures from point\nsource profiles. Additionally, comparison of our small beam 100 micron fluxes\nwith the large beam IRAS fluxes shows how much flux falls beyond our detectors\nbut within the IRAS beam. Several sources with point- like cores show evidence\nfor such a net flux deficit. We clearly resolved six of these galaxies at 100\nmicrons and have some evidence for extension in seven others. Those galaxies\nwhich we have resolved can have little of their 100 micron flux directly\nemitted by a point-like active galactic nucleus (AGN). Dust heated to ~40 K by\nrecent bursts of non-nuclear star formation provides the best explanation for\ntheir extreme FIR luminosity. In a few cases, heating of an extended region by\na compact central source is also a plausible option. Assuming the FIR emission\nwe see is from dust, we also use the sizes we derive to find the dust\ntemperatures and optical depths at 100 microns which we translate into an\neffective visual extinction through the galaxy.

With standard assumptions for convective overshooting a\ncase B mass transfer starting with a 3.5 M_sun donor star is the most likely\nevolutionary solution for Cygnus X-2. This makes the currently observed state\nrather short-lived, of order 3 Myr, and requires a formation rate > 1e-7 - 1e-6\nper yr of such systems in the Galaxy.

We find that the seven acoustic emission recordings of seven\npressure tanks which was brought to rupture exhibit clear acceleration in\nagreement with a power law ``divergence'' expected from the critical point\ntheory. In addition, we find strong evidence of log-periodic corrections that\nquantify the intermittent succession of accelerating bursts and quiescent\nphases of the acoustic emissions on the approach to rupture.

None of the five Class I\nspectra show CO v = 0 -- 2 absorption features, consistent with high K-band\ncontinuum veilings, 4 <= r_k <= 20 and fast stellar rotation, assuming that the\nunderlying protostellar photospheres are of late spectral type, as is suggested\nby the low luminosities of most of these objects. Two of the flat-spectrum\nprotostellar objects also show no absorption features and are likely to be\nhighly veiled. The remaining two flat-spectrum sources show weak, broad\nabsorptions which are consistent with an origin in quickly rotating (v sin i ~\n50 km / s) late-type stellar photospheres which are also strongly veiled, r_k =\n3 - 4. These observations provide further evidence that: 1)-Class I sources are\nhighly veiled at near-infrared wavelengths, confirming previous findings of\nlower resolution spectroscopic studies; and 2)- flat-spectrum protostars rotate\nmore rapidly than classical T Tauri stars (Class II sources), supporting\nfindings from a recent high resolution spectroscopic study of other\nflat-spectrum sources in this cloud. In addition our observations are\nconsistent with the high rotation rates derived for two of the Class I\nprotostellar objects in our sample from observations of variable hard X-ray\nemission obtained with the ASCA satellite.

We examine the possibility that the 4D massless\nchiral fermion bound to the domain wall in the 5D world can be regarded as the\nreal 4D fermions such as neutrinos, quarks and other leptons.",

The\nsource was observed two times, in 1997 and in 1999. A phase-averaged X-ray flux\nof 1.1E-11 ergs cm-2 s-1 and pulsation period of 1549.1+/-0.4 s were\nconsistently obtained from these two observations. The X-ray spectrum was\nrepresented by a flat absorbed power-law with a photon-index of =~0.8 and an\nabsorption column density of =~1.3E22 cm-2. Also, a signature of iron K-shell\nline emission with a centroid of 6.7 keV and an equivalent width of\napproximately 450 eV was detected. From the pulsation period and the iron-line\nfeature, AX J183220-0840 is likely to be a magnetic white dwarf binary with a\ncomplexly absorbed thermal spectrum with a temperature of about 10 keV.",

In a search for synchrotron counterpart of the TeV\nnebula, we have taken V-band CCD images of the region around the PSR B1706-44\npulsar position. By rejecting all point source contributions down to the\ndiffuse sky limit, we were able to search for such extended plerionic\nsynchrotron emission on scale sizes limited by the angular resolution of the\nCANGAROO imaging TeV observations. By combining the V-band flux limits with the\nobserved TeV flux, we were able to obtain upper limits for the magnetic field\nstrength as a function of the radius of the assumed TeV nebula. Assuming that\nthe 2 arcminute radio plerion also defines the size of the TeV nebula, we\nconstrain the steady state particle spectral index to the values between 4 and\n5.5, with a field strength limit of about 3x10^-6 G.

This concept can\naccount for the exquisite sensitivity of the auditory system and its wide\ndynamic range, as well as its capacity to respond selectively to different\nfrequencies. A specific model of sound detection by the hair cells of the inner\near is discussed. We show that a collection of motor proteins within a hair\nbundle can generate oscillations at a frequency which depends on the elastic\nproperties of the bundle. Simple variation of bundle geometry gives rise to\nhair cells with characteristic frequencies which span the range of audibility.\nTension-gated transduction channels, which primarily serve to detect the motion\nof a hair bundle, also tune each cell by admitting ions which regulate the\nmotor protein activity. By controlling the bundle's propensity to oscillate,\nthis feedback automatically maintains the system in the operating regime where\nit is most sensitive to sinusoidal stimuli. The model explains how hair cells\ncan detect sounds which carry less energy than the background noise.",

These equations apply whenever all coherent\neffects have already been damped out. The range of validity of these rate\nequations is investigated in detail for the case of phase fluctuations. The\nresulting asymptotic power laws are investigated which characterize the long\ntime dynamics of the laser-excited Rydberg electron and it is shown to which\nextent these power laws depend on details of the laser spectrum.",

Some of them are single objects,\nincluding low-mass galaxies with active star formation (SF). In this work we\npresent the description of observations and results of the long-slit\nspectrophotometry with the Russian 6-m telescope of three VV-galaxies looking\nlike double or multiple systems, and HI-observations of one of them in order to\nelucidate their nature, determine their metallicity, kinematic properties and\nthe evolution status. Galaxies VV432 and VV747 are found to be dwarf systems\nwith low oxygen abundance (O/H = 1/22 and 1/12 of the solar value,\nrespectively). Their velocity curves indicate quite slow rotation with\nrespective maximum velocities of about 60 and 80 km/s, in agreement with their\nlow luminosities. The distance to VV432 is rather uncertain. If it is a member\nof Virgo Cluster, this is the most metal-deficient known galaxy of this\naggregate. For galaxy VV543 the measured emission-line redshift 0.047 appeared\nten times larger than it was given in the original paper and is cited in\ndatabases. This \"system\" evidently represents an optical pair of two galaxies\nwith large velocity difference. The fainter western component is an HII-galaxy,\nwhile the brighter one is an absorption-line early-type galaxy with the radial\nvelocity being 1600 km/s lower.",

New\nmirror fermions and a minimal set of Higgs particles that breaks the symmetry\ndown to $U(1)_{em}$ are proposed. The model can accommodate a consistent\npattern for charged and neutral fermion masses as well as neutrino\noscillations. An important consequence of the model is that the connection\nbetween the left and right sectors can be done by the neutral vector gauge\nbosons Z and a new heavy Z'.",

It is shown that the nonlinear\ninteractions can dramatically affect the MQST and the atomic tunneling, and\nlead to the collapses and revivals (CR) of population imbalance between the two\ncondensates. The competing effects between the self-interaction of each species\nand the interspecies interaction can lead to the quenching of the MQST and the\nsuppression of the CR and the Shapiro-like steps of the atomic tunneling\ncurrent. It is revealed that the interatomic nonlinear interactions can induce\nthe coherent atomic tunneling between two condensates even though there does\nnot exist the interspecies Josephson-like tunneling coupling.",

By taking a logarithmically\nspaced radial coordinate grid, the method has the natural capability of\ntreating problems that span several decades in radius, in the most extreme case\nfrom the stellar radius up to parsec scale. Flux conservation is guaranteed in\nspherical coordinates by a particular choice of discrete photon directions and\na special treatment of nearly-radially outward propagating radiation. The\nalgorithm works well from zero up to very high optical depth, and can be used\nfor a wide variety of transfer problems, including non-LTE line formation, dust\ncontinuum transfer and high temperature processes such as compton scattering.\nIn this paper we focus on multiple scattering off dust grains and on non-LTE\ntransfer in molecular and atomic lines. Line transfer is treated according to\nan ALI scheme for multi-level atoms/molecules, and includes both random and\nsystematic velocity fields. The algorithms are implemented in a multi-purpose\nuser-friendly radiative transfer program named RADICAL.

The upper limits on our AGN tracers [NeV] 14.32um & 24.32um and\n[NeVI] 7.65um imply an A(V)>160 towards the NLR, assuming the NLR to be of\nequal strength as in the Circinus galaxy. Other possibilities are discussed.\nThe starburst excitation indicators [NeIII]15.56um/[NeII]12.81um and\nL(bol)/L(lyc) suggest that the starburst in the central region is at least\n5x10^6 yrs old, and that it accounts for at least half of the nuclear\nbolometric luminosity. The starburst might well power the entire bolometric\nluminosity, but the available constraints are also consistent with an up to 50%\ncontribution of the embedded AGN. With PHT-S, at a resolution of approximately\n90, we detect strong absorption features of water ice, and, for the first time\nin an external galaxy, of CO_2 and CO. The same PHT-S spectrum also reveals\nstrong emission from the family of PAH features. Finally, we have observed and\ndetected several pure rotational and ro-vibrational H_2 lines, two of which,\nthe (0-0) S(0) & S(1) lines, allow us to determine the excitation temperature\n(160K) and warm H_2 mass (2.4x10^7 Msun). The low excitation temperature shows\nOrion-like shocks not to be representative for the entire emission of the\ncentral region of the galaxy and fairly normal PDRs to be perhaps more typical.",

We consider a single network derived from\nbacteriophage $\\lambda$, and construct a two-parameter deterministic model\ndescribing the temporal evolution of the concentration of $\\lambda$ repressor\nprotein. Bistability in the steady-state protein concentration arises\nnaturally, and we show how the bistable regime is enhanced with the addition of\nthe first operator site in the promotor region. We then show how additive and\nmultiplicative external noise can be used to regulate expression. In the\nadditive case, we demonstrate the utility of such control through the\nconstruction of a protein switch, whereby protein production is turned ``on''\nand ``off'' using short noise pulses. In the multiplicative case, we show that\nsmall deviations in the transcription rate can lead to large fluctuations in\nthe production of protein, and describe how these fluctuations can be used to\namplify protein production significantly. These novel results suggest that an\nexternal noise source could be used as a switch and/or amplifier for gene\nexpression. Such a development could have important implications for gene\ntherapy.",

In the Low-Hard\nX-ray state the system displays a strong 3-way linear correlation between soft-\nand hard-X-rays and radio emission, implying a coupling between the\nComptonising corona and a radio-emitting compact jet. In this state the radio\nemission is linearly polarised at a level of around 2 %, with an almost\nconstant polarisation angle, indicative of a favored axis in this system\nprobably related to the compact jet and/or black hole spin axis. In the Off\nX-ray state the radio emission declines with the X-ray emission to below\ndetectable levels, suggesting that it is simply a lower-luminosity version of\nthe Low-Hard state. In the High-Soft state both the hard-X-ray and radio\nemission are suppressed. We also note that the transitions from the Low-Hard\nstate to the High-Soft state (and the reverse) are possibly associated with\ndiscrete ejection(s) of expanding relativistic plasma.",

We use the new 7C\nRedshift Survey along with the brighter 3CRR and 6C samples to investigate the\nfraction of objects with observed broad emission lines - the `quasar fraction'\n- as a function of redshift and of radio and narrow emission line luminosity.\nWe find that the quasar fraction is more strongly dependent upon luminosity\n(both narrow line and radio) than it is on redshift. Above a narrow [OII]\nemission line luminosity of log L_[OII] > 35 W (or radio luminosity log L_151 >\n26.5 W/Hz/sr), the quasar fraction is virtually independent of redshift and\nluminosity; this is consistent with a simple unified scheme with an obscuring\ntorus with a half-opening angle theta_trans approx 53 degrees. For objects with\nless luminous narrow lines, the quasar fraction is lower. We show that this is\nnot due to the difficulty of detecting lower-luminosity broad emission lines in\na less luminous, but otherwise similar, quasar population. We discuss evidence\nwhich supports at least two probable physical causes for the drop in quasar\nfraction at low luminosity: (i) a gradual decrease in theta_trans and/or a\ngradual increase in the fraction of lightly-reddened (0 < A(V) < 5)\nlines-of-sight with decreasing quasar luminosity; and (ii) the emergence of a\ndistinct second population of low luminosity radio sources which, like M87,\nlack a well-fed quasar nucleus and may well lack a thick obscuring torus.",

A\nsteadily accreting $10^6$ Gauss magnetic white dwarf should ultimately collapse\nto a strongly differentially rotating, millisecond-rotation-period neutron star\nfor a wide range of steady accretion rates and initial masses if the accreting\nwhite dwarf has an evolved O-Ne-Mg composition. A similar neutron star could\nalso result from an initial C-O white dwarf but only for more constrained\naccretion rates. Because the collapsing white dwarf begins as a $\\gamma=4/3$\npolytrope, the final neutron star's spin-rate increases strongly with\ncylindrical radius. A stable wind-up of the neutron star's poloidal magnetic\nfield then produces buoyant magnetic toroids which grow, break loose, rise, and\npartly penetrate the neutron star surface to form a transient, $B\\approx\n10^{17}$ G millisecond spin-period pulsar with a powerful pulsar wind (Usov\n1992). This pulsar wind emission is then rapidly suppressed by the surface\nshear motion from the strong stellar differential rotation. This wind-up and\ntransient pulsar formation can occur at other times on different cylinders\nand/or repeat on the same one, with (re-)wind up and surface penetration time\nscales hugely longer han the neutron star's millisecond spin period. In this\nway, differential rotation both opens and closes the doors which allow neutron\nstar spin-energy to be emitted in powerful bursts of pulsar wind. Predictions\nof this model compare favorably to needed central engine properties of\ngamma-ray burst sources (total energy, duration, sub-burst fluctuations and\ntime scales, variability among burst events, and baryon loading).",

    "summary": "We study the circumstances under which a Kaluza-Klein reduction on an\nn-sphere, with a massless truncation that includes all the Yang-Mills fields of\nSO(n+1), can be consistent at the full non-linear level. We take as the\nstarting point a theory comprising a p-form field strength and (possibly) a\ndilaton, coupled to gravity in the higher dimension D. We show that aside from\nthe previously-studied cases with (D,p)=(11,4) and (10,5) (associated with the\nS^4 and S^7 reductions of D=11 supergravity, and the S^5 reduction of type IIB\nsupergravity), the only other possibilities that allow consistent reductions\nare for p=2, reduced on S^2, and for p=3, reduced on S^3 or S^{D-3}. We\nconstruct the fully non-linear Kaluza-Klein Ansatze in all these cases. In\nparticular, we obtain D=3, N=8, SO(8) and D=7, N=2, SO(4) gauged supergravities\nfrom S^7 and S^3 reductions of N=1 supergravity in D=10.",

    "summary": "The issue of field redefinition invariance of path integrals in quantum field\ntheory is reexamined. A ``paradox'' is presented involving the reduction to an\neffective quantum-mechanical theory of a $(d+1)$-dimensional free scalar field\nin a Minkowskian spacetime with compactified spatial coordinates. The\nimplementation of field redefinitions both before and after the reduction\nsuggests that operator-ordering issues in quantum field theory should not be\nignored.",

    "summary": "This paper is divided into two parts. In the first part, we develop a general\nmethod for expressing ranks of matrix expressions that involve Moore-Penrose\ninverses, group inverses, Drazin inverses, as well as weighted Moore-Penrose\ninverses of matrices. Through this method we establish a variety of valuable\nrank equalities related to generalized inverses of matrices mentioned above.\nUsing them, we characterize many matrix equalities in the theory of generalized\ninverses of matrices and their applications. In the second part, we consider\nmaximal and minimal possible ranks of matrix expressions that involve variant\nmatrices, the fundamental work is concerning extreme ranks of the two linear\nmatrix expressions $A - BXC$ and $A - B_1X_1C_1 - B_2X_2C_2$. As applications,\nwe present a wide range of their consequences and applications in matrix\ntheory.",
