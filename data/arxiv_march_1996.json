    "summary": "We introduce an algorithm for combinatorial search on quantum computers that\nis capable of significantly concentrating amplitude into solutions for some NP\nsearch problems, on average. This is done by exploiting the same aspects of\nproblem structure as used by classical backtrack methods to avoid unproductive\nsearch choices. This quantum algorithm is much more likely to find solutions\nthan the simple direct use of quantum parallelism. Furthermore, empirical\nevaluation on small problems shows this quantum algorithm displays the same\nphase transition behavior, and at the same location, as seen in many previously\nstudied classical search methods. Specifically, difficult problem instances are\nconcentrated near the abrupt change from underconstrained to overconstrained\nproblems.",

This is then discussed in the context of D-strings in Type IIB\nsuperstrings.

For these D-strings and other D-branes the entropy and temperature\nare consequences of the physical motion of stuck open strings along the D-brane\nand this leads to a simple space-time interpretation.

The\nbasic properties of this `spectral distance' are then investigated. It can be\nrelated to a reduced density matrix element in quantum cosmology. Thus,\ncalculating the spectral distance gives us an insight for the quantum\ntheoretical decoherence between two universes. The spectral distance does not\nin general satisfy the triangular inequality, illustrating that it is not\nequivalent to the distance defined by the DeWitt metric on the superspace.\n  We then pose a question: Whether two universes with different topologies\ninterfere with each other quantum mechanically? We concentrate on the\ndifference in the orientabilities. Several concrete models in 2-dimension are\nset up, and the spectral distances between them are investigated: Tori and\nKlein's bottles, spheres and real projective spaces. Quite surprisingly, we\nfind many cases of spaces with different orientabilities in which the spectral\ndistance turns out to be very short. It may suggest that, without any other\nspecial mechanism, two such universes interfere with each other quite strongly.",

For the homogeneous system, two\ndifferent long-time behaviors arise as a function of $\\e$.

Examples are trans-polyacetylene and the cuprate\nhigh temperature superconductors. Whereas doping of a band insulator results in\na shift of the chemical potential into the conduction or valence band, doping\nof a correlated insulator produces fundamental changes in the electronic\ndensity of states itself. We have found that a general feature of doping a\ncorrelated insulator is the generation of topological defects; solitons in\none-dimension and anti-phase domain walls in higher dimensions. We review the\nwell known features of this process in polyacetylene, and describe the\nexperimental evidence that the analogous features are seen in the cuprate\nsuperconductors. We also distinguish the case in which the doping-induced\nfeatures can be viewed as a Fermi surface instability, as in polyacetylene, and\nthe more usual case in which they are a consequence of a Coulomb frustrated\nelectronic tendency to phase separation.\n  Paper presented at the Sixtieth Birthday Symposium for Alan J.

We present a self-organized critical model of punctuated equilibrium\nbehavior in the context of biological evolution, and solve it in the limit that\nthe number of independent traits for each species diverges. We derive an exact\nequation of motion for the avalanche dynamics from the microscopic rules. In\nthe continuum limit, avalanches propagate via a diffusion equation with a\nnonlocal, history-dependent potential representing memory. This nonlocal\npotential gives rise to a non-Gaussian (fat) tail for the subdiffusive\nspreading of activity. The probability for the activity to spread beyond a\ndistance $r$ in time $s$ decays as $\\sqrt{24\\over\\pi}s^{-3/2}x^{1/3}\n\\exp{[-{3\\over 4}x^{1/3}]}$ for $x={r^4\\over s} \\gg 1$. The potential\nrepresents a hierarchy of time scales that is dynamically generated by the\nultrametric structure of avalanches, which can be quantified in terms of\n``backward'' avalanches. In addition, a number of other correlation functions\ncharacterizing the punctuated equilibrium dynamics are determined exactly.",

The UV continuum between 1220 and 1990 A has\nvaried considerably. In 1991 August, the flux at 1360 A reached a maximum level\n~27 times as high as its minimum level. At 1850 A, the continuum varies by a\nfactor of ~12. Significant variations are frequently observed in periods as\nshort as one month. The total flux of Ly-alpha and C IV emission varies by a\nfactor of ~5. Their profiles are fitted with one narrow component, unresolved\nat the instrumental resolution of FWHM ~2000 km/s, and three broad components\n(FWHM ~6000 km/s). The narrow component varies by a factor of ~2.5. The broad\ncomponents on the blue and red wings of the Ly-alpha and C IV emission profile,\nwhich correspond to the double humps in the H-alpha and H-beta emission\nfeature, display a close correlation to the varying continuum, with a time lag\nof ~45 days. The blue Ly-alpha component has been stronger than the red\ncomponent except for several epochs in 1980 and 1991. The C IV/Ly-alpha flux\nratio is ~0.4 for the narrow component. For the broad components, this ratio\nvaries considerably around an average value of unity. In 1991 March, the blue\nLy-alpha component was stronger than the red, while for C IV the red component\nwas stronger. Such differential variations do not match the accretion disk\ncharacteristics. The findings suggest that the narrow- and broad-line region in\n3C 390.3 may be associated with a radio jet.",

The mean-field\nphase diagram is obtained by the Gutzwiller-type variational technique in the\nplane of filling and interaction parameters. Various ground-state properties\nare also studied by the quantum Monte Carlo method. Our model exhibits two\ntypes of diagonal long-range orders; the density order around the density\n$n=1/2$ and the Ising-type component order near $n=1$. The quantum Monte Carlo\nresults for the transitions from the superfluid state to these two ordered\nstates show marked contrast with the Gutzwiller results. Namely, although they\nare both accompanied by phase separation into commensurate ($n=1/2$ or $n=1$)\nand incommensurate density phases, these transitions are both continuous. The\ncontinuous growth of the component correlation severely suppresses the\nsuperfluidity as well as the inverse of the effective mass in the critical\nregion of the component order transition in contrast to the persistence of the\nsuperfluidity in the density-ordered state. We propose a mechanism of the mass\nenhancement observed even far from the Mott insulating filling $n=1$, when the\nIsing-type component order persists into $n \\neq 1$. Possible relevance of this\ntype of mass enhancement in other systems is also discussed.",

We\nfound that these calibrations yield a self-consistent set of atmospheric\nparameters for \\teff$>4400$~K, representing a clear improvement over results\nobtained with older model atmospheres. Using this \\teff-scale and Fe\nequilibrium of ionization, we obtained very low gravities (implying\nluminosities incompatible with that expected for RGB stars) for metal-poor\nstars cooler than 4400~K; this might be due either to a moderate Fe\noverionization (expected from statistical equilibrium calculations) or to\ninadequacy of Kurucz models to describe the atmospheres of very cool giants.\nOur \\teff\\ scale is compared with other scales recently used for metal-poor\nstars; it agrees well with those obtained using Kurucz (1992) models, but it\ngives much larger \\teff's than those obtained using OSMARCS models (Edvardsson\net al. 1993). This difference is attributed to the different treatment of\nconvection in the two sets of models. For the Sun, the Kurucz (1992) model\nappears to be preferable to the OSMARCS ones because it better predicts the\nsolar limb darkening; furthermore, we find that our photometric \\teff's for\nmetal-poor stars agree well with both direct estimates based on the IRFM, and\nwith \\teff's derived from H$\\alpha$\\ wings when using Kurucz models.",

The main aim of our investigation is to provide new constraints\non the properties of distant galaxies responsible for the DLA absorption. After\nsubtracting the point spread function associated with the QSO light, we have\ndetected galaxies very close to the QSO line of sight (projected distance\n1.2-1.3arcsec) in two fields. These sources therefore represent promising\ncandidate galaxies responsible for the DLA absorption. Placed at the absorber's\nredshift, the impact parameter is 10h_50^-1kpc and the luminosity is close to\nL_K^*. Such parameters are consistent with the hypothesis, verified for\nmetallic systems at lower redshift, that slowly-evolving massive galaxies\nproduce at least some of the absorption systems of high column density in QSO\nspectra out to beyond z=2. In addition to detecting these candidate DLA\ngalaxies, the radio-loud QSOs in our sample show a significant excess of\nsources on larger scales (theta=7arcsec); this excess is not present in the\nradio-quiet QSO sightlines. We calculate that such an excess could be produced\nby luminous galaxies in the cores of clusters associated with radio-loud QSOs.\nBoth results confirm that deep imaging of selected QSOs can be a powerful\nmethod of finding samples of likely z~2 galaxies. Follow-up near-infrared\nspectroscopy is required to secure galaxy redshifts and star formation rates,\nwhile deep HST imaging can determine sizes and morphologies, providing valuable\ninformation on galaxy properties at large look-back times.",

On the other hand, by exploring the structure of the\neffective potential in those approximation consistent with `triviality', where\nthe Higgs mass does not represent a measure of any observable interaction, SSB\ndoes not require an ultraviolet cutoff, the phase transition is first-order,\nsuch that the massless `Coleman-Weinberg' regime lies in the broken phase, and\none gets only $m_h<$3 TeV from vacuum stability. To separate out the two\nalternatives, we present a precise lattice computation of the slope of the\neffective potential in the region of bare parameters indicated by the\nLuscher~\\&~Weisz and Brahm's analysis of the critical line. Our lattice data\nstrongly support the latter description of SSB.

The enhanced\nrelaxation arises because the radial and azimuthal orbital frequencies in a\nKeplerian potential are equal, and hence may be termed {\\em resonant\nrelaxation}. We explore the dynamics of resonant relaxation using both\nnumerical simulations and order-of-magnitude analytic calculations. We find\nthat the resonant angular momentum relaxation time is shorter than the\nnon-resonant relaxation time by of order $M_\\star/M$, where $M_\\star$ is the\nmass in stars and $M$ is the mass of the central object. Resonance does not\nenhance the energy relaxation rate. We examine the effect of resonant\nrelaxation on the rate of tidal disruption of stars by the central mass; we\nfind that the flux of stars into the loss cone is enhanced when the loss cone\nis empty, but that the disruption rate averaged over the entire cluster is not\nstrongly affected. We show that relativistic precession can disable resonant\nrelaxation near the main-sequence loss cone for black hole masses comparable to\nthose in galactic nuclei. Resonant dynamical friction leads to growth or decay\nof the eccentricity of the orbit of a massive body, depending on whether the\ndistribution function of the stars is predominantly radial or tangential. The\naccelerated relaxation implies that there are regions in nuclear star clusters\nthat are relaxed in angular momentum but not in energy; unfortunately, these\nregions are not well-resolved in nearby galaxies by the Hubble Space Telescope.",

In practice, the data set is so large that both a brute force\nlikelihood analysis and a direct expansion in signal-to-noise eigenmodes will\nbe computationally unfeasible.

We show that the quark condensate, as other observables, is\nindependent on the variant selected. The application to physical pions excludes\nthe linear sigma model as a credible one. In the non-linear models our\nconclusions are: first there is no systematic reaction imposed by chiral\nsymmetry against symmetry restoration, second, if one keeps only the s-wave\npion-nucleon interaction, the quark condensate evolves essentially linearly\nwith density, as if the nucleons were non interacting. The main correction\narises from the p-wave pion-nucleon interaction. Last, in the s-wave optical\npotential, chiral symmetry tolerates but does not impose two body terms. On the\nother hand the effect of correlations linked to the isospin symmetric amplitude\nis negligible.",

The\nsample covers a wide range in redshift (0<z<3.3), in X-ray spectral slope (-1.5\n<ax<2.6) and in optical-to-X-ray ratio (0.4$<aox<1.5). A correlation is found\nbetween ax and aox; similar correlations have recently been reported in other\nX-ray and optical samples. We also identify previously unreported relationships\nbetween the optical slope (aopt) and ax (particularly at high redshifts) and\nbetween aopt and aox. These trends show that the overall optical-to-X-ray conti\nnuum changes from convex to concave as ax hardens, demonstrating a strong beha\nvioural link between the optical/UV big blue bump (BBB) and the soft X-ray ex\ncess, which is consistent with them being part of the same spectral component.\nBy constructing models of the optical-to-X-ray continuum, we demonstrate that\nthe observed correlations are consistent with an intrinsic spectrum which is ab\nsorbed through different amounts of cold gas and dust. The intrinsic spectrum\nis the sum of an optical-to-soft X-ray `big bump' component and an ax=1 power\nlaw; the column density of the cold gas ranges from 0 to ~4E21 cm-2 and the\ndust-to-gas ratio is assumed to be Galactic. The `big bump' may be represented\nby a T~1E6 K thermal bremsstrahlung or an accretion disk with a surrounding hot\ncorona. The scatter in the data can accommodate a wide range in big bump tempe\nrature (or black hole mass) and strength. A source for the absorbing gas may be\nthe dusty, molecular torus which lies beyond the broad line-emitting regions,\nalthough with a much lower column density than observed in Seyfert 2 galaxies.\nAlternatively, it may be the bulge of a spiral host galaxy or an elliptical\nhost galaxy.",

Different approximations for the latter, either based\non a phenomenological ansatz or derived from analyses of the meson spectra, are\nadopted. In particular, two wave functions, constructed via the Hamiltonian\nlight-front formalism using a relativized and a non-relativistic constituent\nquark model, are considered, obtaining a link between standard spectroscopic\nquark models and the B-meson decay physics. The inclusive semileptonic and\nnon-leptonic branching ratios are calculated within a convolution approach,\ninspired by the partonic model and involving the same B-meson wave function\nused for the evaluation of the exclusive semileptonic modes. Our results for\nthe major branching ratios are consistent with available experimental data and\nthe sum of all the calculated branching ratios turns out to be close to unity.\nIn particular, we found that: i) a remarkable fraction (~ 35%) of semileptonic\ndecay modes occur in non-D, non-D* final states; ii) non-perturbative effects\nenhance the inclusive b -> c \\bar{u} d decay channels, with a sizable\ncontribution provided by internal decays into heavy mesons and\nbaryon-antibaryon pairs; the resulting reduction of the semileptonic branching\nratio brings the theoretical prediction in agreement with the experimental\nvalue without increasing at the same time the charm counting.",

The\nmethods used for constructing these duals can be generalized to any model\ninvolving arbitrary 2-index tensor representations of Sp(2N), SO(N), or SU(N)\ngroups.",

We show that the masses of\nthese clouds must be over a relatively narrow range so that they are stable\nagainst gravitational collapse and evaporation. These masses, near $10^6\n\\msun$, also lead to a covering factor near unity. The hot phase is required to\nhave a core radius such that its cooling time in the core is equal to the age\nof the halo, and the mass in the cold phase is determined by the rate at which\nthe hot gas cools. We calculate the number of Lyman limit systems arising in\nhalos of different masses in a CDM model and their impact parameters implied by\nthese assumptions, and find them to be in reasonable agreement with\nobservations. The observed low ionization systems such as MgII are well\nreproduced as arising from the photoionized phase, and are mostly in halos\naround massive galaxies, while CIV selected systems are predicted to be more\ncommonly associated with lower mass galaxies and larger impact parameters.

The element $x$ of the ring over which the TQFT is defined does not\nhave to be invertible. In particular, it may be 0. This modification makes it\npossible to extend quantum-invariants, which vanish on $S^1\\times S^2$, to\nnon-trivial TQFT's. (A TQFT in the sense of Atiyah with this property has to be\ntrivial all together). Under a few natural assumptions the notion of a\nhalf-projective TQFT is shown to be the only possible generalization. Based on\nseparate work with Lyubashenko on connected TQFT's, we construct a large class\nof half-projective TQFT's with $x=0$. Their invariants vanish on $S^1\\times\nS^2$, and they coincide with the Hennings invariant for non-semisimple Hopf\nalgebras. Several toplogical tools that are relevant for vanishing properties\nof such TQFT's are developed. They are concerned with connectivity properties\nof cobordisms, as for example maximal non-separating surfaces. We introduce in\nparticular the notions of ``interior'' homotopy and homology groups, and of\ncoordinate graphs, which are functions on cobordisms with values in the\nmorphisms of a graph category. For applications we will prove that\nhalf-projective TQFT's with $x=0$ vanish on cobordisms with infinite interior\nhomology, and we argue that the order of divergence of the TQFT on a cobordism\nin the ``classical limit'' can be estimated by the rank of its maximal free\ninterior group.",

The velocity distribution of the barred spirals in the Virgo\nregion is clearly different than that of the nonbarred spirals, suggesting that\nbarred spirals are more common in the main condensation of the cluster. A\nsample cleansed of galaxies not belonging to the main cluster condensation\nusing the subcluster assignments of Binggeli et al.

Solutions free of curvature singularities are\nselected; they can be attributed to traversible wormholes with cosmic\nstring-like singularities at their necks. In the presence of an electromagnetic\nfield some of these wormholes are globally regular, the string-like singularity\nbeing replaced by a set of twofold branching points. Consequences of wormhole\nregularity and symmetry conditions are discussed. In particular, it is shown\nthat (i) regular, symmetric wormholes have necessarily positive masses as\nviewed from both asymptotics and (ii) their characteristic length scale in the\nbig charge limit ($GM^2 \\ll Q^2$) is of the order of the ``classical radius\"\n$Q^2/M$.",

In this paper, we show directly\nthat these chiral algebras are essentially the same as vertex algebras without\nvacuum vector (and without grading), by establishing an equivalence between the\nskew-symmetry and Jacobi identity relations of Beilinson-Drinfeld and the\n(similarly-named, but different) skew-symmetry and Jacobi identity relations in\nthe formal-variable approach to vertex operator algebra theory as formulated by\nBorcherds, Frenkel-Lepowsky-Meurman and Frenkel-Huang-Lepowsky.",

The form of the action is\nessentially the same as that discussed by Bishop and coworkers in studying the\ndynamics of the soliton in polyacetylene, though some details are different.\nFor the moving excitation with a velocity $v$, the width is determined by\nminimizing the effective action. A requirement that there must be a minimum in\nthe action as a function of its width provides a maximum velocity. The velocity\ndependence of the width and energy can be determined. The motions of a soliton\nin p olyacetylene and an acoustic polaron in polydiacetylene are studied within\nthis formulation.

We clarify the relation between the regularization scheme and\nthe Pauli--Villars--Gupta (PVG) type Lagrangian level regularization. The\nconventional PVG, being non-gauge invariant for chiral gauge theories, in\ngeneral corresponds to the consistent regularization scheme. The covariant\nregularization scheme, on the other hand, is realized by the generalized PVG\nLagrangian recently proposed by Frolov and Slavnov. These correspondences are\nclarified by reformulating the PVG method as a regularization of the composite\ngauge current operator.",

    "summary": "It is known that if gauge conditions have Gribov zero modes, then topological\nsymmetry is broken. In this paper we apply it to topological gravity in\ndimension $n \\geq 3$. Our choice of the gauge condition for conformal\ninvariance is $R+{\\alpha}=0$ , where $R$ is the Ricci scalar curvature. We find\nwhen $\\alpha \\neq 0$, topological symmetry is not broken, but when $\\alpha =0$\nand solutions of the Einstein equations exist then topological symmetry is\nbroken. This conditions connect to the Yamabe conjecture. Namely negative\nconstant scalar curvature exist on manifolds of any topology, but existence of\nnonnegative constant scalar curvature is restricted by topology. This fact is\neasily seen in this theory. Topological symmetry breaking means that BRS\nsymmetry breaking in cohomological field theory. But it is found that another\nBRS symmetry can be defined and physical states are redefined. The divergence\ndue to the Gribov zero modes is regularized, and the theory after topological\nsymmetry breaking become semiclassical Einstein gravitational theory under a\nspecial definition of observables.",

We derive the star formation rate and star formation\nhistories of the galaxies, and check their dependence on other parameters.\n  Comparison of the sample galaxies with population synthesis models shows that\nthese objects have significantly lower metallicity than the Solar value. The\ncolors can generally be explained as a combination of two different stellar\npopulations: a young (3--20 Myr) population which represents the stars\ncurrently forming, and an older (0.1--1 Gyr) population of previous stellar\ngenerations. This is consistent with the explanation that star formation in\nthis type of objects takes place in short bursts followed by long quiescent\nperiods.\n  No significant relation is found between the star formation properties of the\nsample galaxies and their hydrogen content. Apparently, when star formation\noccurs in bursts, other parameters influence the star formation properties more\nsignificantly than the amount of hydrogen.

We develop theoretical models for the radio and far-infrared (FIR)\nemission of normal galaxies and study the influence of their main parameters on\nthe ratio of the two emissions. In addition, data are used from a sample of 114\nlate-type galaxies which allow an estimate of the mean energy densities of the\nradiation field and the magnetic field, and of the dust opacity. These data\nreveal, for the first time, a reasonably good, linear correlation between the\nenergy density of the radiation field and the energy density of the magnetic\nfield. Furthermore we find that on average the galaxies are marginally\noptically thick for the non-ionizing UV light. Including their extended\nmagnetic halos, galaxies are also found to be on average marginally optically\nthick regarding the radiative energy losses of the Cosmic Ray electrons.\nCombining these semi-empirical results with the theoretical emission models we\nshow that in the optically thick case the linear correlation between the energy\ndensities of the radiation field and the magnetic field is a necessary\ncondition for the existence of the observed FIR/radio correlation. Furthermore\nwe show that the individual dispersion of the FIR to radio continuum ratio\ncaused by uncertainties of any single one of the parameters considered is\nsignificantly less than the empirical dispersion of the FIR/radio correlation.\nThe radio and the FIR emission are mainly determined by their sources, i.e.\nmassive supernova precursor stars, because galaxies act in a reasonable\napproximation as calorimeters for the stellar UV radiation and for the energy\nflux of the Cosmic Ray electrons.",

Our sample\nconsists of nine massive halos from an EdS universe with scale free power\nspectrum and n = -1. Halos are resolved by ~20000 particles each, with a\ndynamical resolution of 20-25 kpc. Large scale tidal fields are included up to\nL=150 Mpc using background particles. The halo formation process can be\ncharacterized by the alternation of two dynamical configurations: a merging\nphase and a relaxation phase, defined by their signature on the evolution of\nthe total mass and rms velocity. Halos spend on average one 1/3 of their\nevolution in the merging phase and 2/3 in the relaxation phase. Using this\ndefinition, we study the density profiles and their change during the halo\nhistory. The average density profiles are fitted by the NFW analytical model\nwith an rms residual of 17% between the virial radius Rv and 0.01 Rv. The\nHernquist (1990) profiles fits the same halos with an rms residual of 26%. The\ntrend with mass of the scale radius of these fits is marginally consistent with\nthat found by Cole & Lacey (1996): in comparison our halos are more centrally\nconcentrated, and the relation between scale radius and halo mass is slightly\nsteeper. We find a moderately large scatter in this relation, due both to\ndynamical evolution within halos and to fluctuations in the halo population. We\nanalyze the dynamical equilibrium of our halos using the Jeans' equation, and\nfind that on average they are approximately in equilibrium within their virial\nradius. Finally, we find that the projected mass profiles of our simulated\nhalos are in very good agreement with the profiles of three rich galaxy\nclusters derived from strong and weak gravitational lensing observations.",

The evolution preserves the symplectic structure.\n  The quantum theory is approached via the quantum initial value problem\n(QIVP); that is, by seeking operator-valued solutions to the equation of motion\nwith initial data representing the canonical (anti)commutation relations. Using\nnormal operator ordering, we construct solutions to the QIVP for both Bose and\nFermi statistics (again for generic choice of parameters) and prove that these\nsolutions are unique. For models with two spatial points, the resulting\nevolution is unitary; however, for a more general model the evolution fails to\npreserve the (anti)commutation relations and is therefore nonunitary. We show\nthat this nonunitary evolution cannot be described using a superscattering\noperator with the usual properties.\n  We present numerical evidence to show that the bosonic quantum theory can\npick out a unique classical limit for certain ranges of the coupling strength,\neven when there are many classical solutions. We show that the quantum theory\ndepends strongly on the choice of operator ordering.\n  In addition, we show that our results differ from those obtained using the\n``self-consistent path integral''.

We claim that the stochastic nature\nof effective field theories is intrinsic, in that dissipation and fluctuations\nare present both above and below the threshold.

The Breit equation is known to be\npathological when singularities appear at finite separations $r$ in the reduced\nset of coupled equations for attractive potentials even when the potentials\nthemselves are not singular there. They then give rise to unphysical bound\nstates and resonances. In contrast, the two-body Dirac equations of constraint\ndynamics do not have these pathologies in many nonperturbative treatments. To\nunderstand these marked differences, we first express these contraint equations\nin a hyperbolic form. These coupled equations are then re-cast into two\nequivalent equations: (1) a covariant Breit-like equation with potentials that\nare exponential functions of certain ``generator'' functions, and (2) a\ncovariant orthogonality constraint on the relative momentum. This reduction\nenables us to show in a transparent way that finite-$r$ singularities do not\nappear as long as the the exponential structure is not tampered with and the\nexponential generators of the interaction are themselves nonsingular for finite\n$r$. These Dirac or Breit equations, free of the structural singularities which\nplague the usual Breit equation, can then be used safely under all\ncircumstances, encompassing numerous applications in the fields of particle,\nnuclear, and atomic physics which involve highly relativistic and strong\nbinding configurations.",

By\napplying the Mellin-Barnes representation to certain internal propagators, the\nresult of the two-loop diagrams is obtained analytically as an expansion in\n$m_c/m_b$.

Then we study the limit\n|q_1^2| -> 0, in which one of the photons is (almost) real. We develop a\nfactorization procedure for the infrared singularities ln(q_1^2),\n1/q_1^2,1/q_1^4,etc., emerging in this limit. The infrared-sensitive\ncontributions are absorbed in this approach by bilocal correlators, which can\nbe also interpreted as the distribution amplitudes for (almost) real photon.\nUnder explicitly formulated assumptions concerning the form of these\namplitudes, we obtain a QCD sum rule for F(q_1^2=0,q_2^2=-Q^2) and study its\nQ^2-dependence. In contrast to pQCD, we make no assumptions about the shape of\nthe pion distribution amplitude varphi_{\\pi}(x).

Extending a\nrecently developed gravitational-wave generation formalism valid for arbitrary\n(slowly-moving) systems, we compute the mass multipole moments of the system\nand the relevant tails present in the wave zone to 2.5PN order. In the case of\ntwo point-masses moving on a quasi-circular orbit, we find that the 2.5PN\ncontribution in the energy loss rate is entirely due to tails. Relying on an\nenergy balance argument we derive the laws of variation of the instantaneous\nfrequency and phase of the binary. The 2.5PN order in the accumulated phase is\nsignificantly large, being grossly of the same order of magnitude as the\nprevious 2PN order, but opposite in sign. However finite mass effects at 2.5PN\norder are small. The results of this paper should be useful when analyzing the\ndata from inspiralling compact binaries in future gravitational-wave detectors\nlike VIRGO and LIGO.",

The energy lost by the CRs\nas they propagate and interact with the microwave background is transformed by\ncascading into secondary GeV-TeV photons. We show that a significant fraction\nof these photons can arrive with delays much smaller than the CR delay if much\nof inter-galactic space is occupied by large-scale magnetic ``voids'', regions\nof size $\\gtrsim5{\\rm Mpc}$ and field weaker than $10^{-15}{\\rm G}$. Such voids\nmight be expected, for example, in models where a weak primordial field is\namplified in shocked, turbulent regions of the intergalactic medium during the\nformation of large-scale structure. For a field strength\n$\\sim4\\times10^{-11}{\\rm G}$ in the high field regions, the value required to\naccount for observed galactic fields if the IGMF were frozen in the\nprotogalactic plasma, the delay of CRs produced by a burst at a distance of\n$100{\\rm Mpc}$ is $\\sim100{\\rm yr}$, and the fluence of secondary photons above\n$10{\\rm GeV}$ on hour--day time scales is $I(>E)\\sim10^{-6}E_{\\rm TeV}^{-1}{\\rm\ncm}^{-2}$. This fluence is close to the detection threshold of current\nhigh-energy $\\gamma$-ray experiments. Detection of the delayed flux would\nsupport the GRB-CR association and would also provide information on the IGMF\nstructure.",

When the viscosity parameter,\n$\\nu$, is small the model has a qualitative behavior which is similar to the\nKolmogorov theories of turbulence. Here a static solution to the model is\nexamined, and a linear stability analysis is performed to obtain response\neigenvalues and eigenfunctions. Both the static behavior and the linear\nresponse show an inertial range with a relatively simple scaling structure. Our\nmain results are: (i) The response frequencies cover a wide range of scales,\nwith ratios which can be understood in terms of the frequency scaling\nproperties of the model. (ii) Even small viscosities play a crucial role in\ndetermining the model's eigenvalue spectrum. (iii) As a parameter within the\nmodel is varied, it shows a ``phase transition'' in which there is an abrupt\nchange in many eigenvalues from stable to unstable values. (iv) The abrupt\nchange is determined by the model's conservation laws and symmetries.\n  This work is thus intended to add to our knowledge of the linear response of\na stiff dynamical systems and at the same time to help illuminate scaling\nwithin a class of turbulence models.",

We analyse in detail the cases of a single\nas well as two bound states. We find that bags that trap $N$ fermions are the\nmost stable ones, because they release all the fermion rest mass as binding\nenergy and become massless. Our explicit construction of the diagonal resolvent\nis based on elementary Sturm-Liouville theory and simple dimensional analysis\nand does not depend on the large $N$ approximation.

In all cases, the thermal effects for an entropy per\nbaryon of order 2 or less are small when considering the maximum neutron star\nmass. Neutrino trapping, however, significantly changes the maximum mass due to\nthe abundance of electrons. When matter is allowed to contain only nucleons and\nleptons, trapping decreases the maximum mass by an amount comparable to, but\nsomewhat larger than, the increase due to finite entropy. When matter is\nallowed to contain strongly interacting negatively charged particles, in the\nform of strange baryons, a kaon condensate, or quarks, trapping instead results\nin an increase in the maximum mass of order $0.2M_\\odot$, which adds to the\neffects of finite entropy. The presence of negatively-charged particles has two\nmajor implications. First, the value of the maximum mass will decrease during\nthe early evolution of a neutron star as it loses trapped neutrinos, so that if\na black hole forms, it either does so immediately after the bounce or it is\ndelayed for a neutrino diffusion timescale of $\\sim 10$ s. The latter case is\nmost likely if the maximum mass of the hot star with trapped neutrinos is near\n$1.5M_\\odot$. In the absence of negatively-charged hadrons, black hole\nformation would be due to accretion and therefore is likely to occur only\nimmediately after bounce. Second, the appearance of hadronic negative charges\nresults in a general softening of the equation of state that may be observable\nin the neutrino luminosities and average energies. Further, these additional\nnegative charges decrease the electron fraction and may be observed in the\nrelative excess of electron neutrinos compared to other neutrinos.",

    "summary": "Extreme microlensing events, defined as events with maximum magnification\n$A_\\max\\gsim 200$ are a potentially powerful probe of the mass spectrum and\nspatial distribution of objects along lines of sight toward the Galactic bulge.\nAbout 75 yr${}^{-1}$ such events are expected for main-sequence sources with\n$I_0<19$. For many of these it is possible to measure both a ``proper motion''\nand a ``parallax'' which together would yield individual mass, distance, and\ntransverse-speed determinations of the lensing object. The proper motion is\ndetermined from finite-source effects when the lens transits, or nearly\ntransits the source. The parallax is determined by observing the difference in\nthe light curve as seen from two Earth observatories separated by about 1 Earth\nradius, $R_\\oplus$. The size of the parallax effect is $\\sim A_\\max\nR_\\oplus/\\tilde r_e$ where $\\tilde r_e$ is the projected Einstein radius. This\ncan be of order 1\\%. Detection of candidate events requires a pixel-lensing\nsearch of the entire bulge once per day, preferably by at least two\nobservatories on different continents. Follow-up observation must be carried\nusing optical/infrared photometry, with short (e.g.\\ 1 minute) exposures on\nsmall ($\\gsim 1$ m) telescopes. Extreme microlensing observations toward the\nLarge Magellanic Cloud do not appear feasible at the present time.",

By varying the hybridization of the host, we can control the\nsize of the semiconducting gap. We consider chains with 25 sites and we place\nthe Anderson impurity (with $U>0$) in the middle of the chain. We dope the\nhalf--filled system with one hole and we find two regimes: when the\nhybridization of the impurity is small, the hole density and the spin are\nlocalized near the impurity. When the hybridization of the impurity is large,\nthe hole and spin density are spread over the lattice. Additional holes avoid\nthe impurity and are extended throughout the lattice. Away from half--filling,\nthe semiconductor with an impurity is analogous to a double well potential with\na very high barrier. We also examine the chemical potential as a function of\nelectron filling, and we find that the impurity introduces midgap states when\nthe impurity hybridization is small.",

Here we\npresent a measurement of the deuterium to hydrogen ratio (D/H) in a newly\ndiscovered high redshift metal-poor gas cloud at redshift $z=2.504$. This\nconfirms our earlier measurement of D/H (Tytler, Fan & Burles 1996), and\ntogether they give the first accurate measurement of the primordial D\nabundance, and a ten fold improvement in the accuracy of the cosmological\ndensity of ordinary matter.This is a high density, with most ordinary matter\nunaccounted or dark, which is too high to agree with measurements of the\nprimordial abundances of helium-4 and lithium-7.

The interface undergoes a depinning transition where the order\nparameter is the interface velocity $v$, which increases as $v \\sim\n(F-F_c)^\\theta$ for driving forces $F$ close to its threshold value $F_c$. We\nconsider a Langevin-type equation which is expected to be valid close to the\ndepinning transition of an interface in a statistically isotropic medium. By a\nfunctional renormalization group scheme the critical exponents characterizing\nthe depinning transition are obtained to the first order in $\\epsilon=4-D>0$,\nwhere $D$ is the interface dimension. The main results were published earlier\n[T. Nattermann et al., J. Phys. II France {\\bf 2} (1992) 1483]. Here, we\npresent details of the perturbative calculation and of the derivation of the\nfunctional flow equation for the random-force correlator. The fixed point\nfunction of the correlator has a cusp singularity which is related to a finite\nvalue of the threshold $F_c$, similar to the mean field theory. We also present\nextensive numerical simulations and compare them with our analytical results\nfor the critical exponents. For $\\epsilon =1$ the numerical and analytical\nresults deviate from each other by only a few percent.

Related methods\npermit now a readily accessible derivation of a number of physical\nmanifestations of localization, in regimes of strong disorder, extreme\nenergies, or weak disorder away from the unperturbed spectrum. The present work\nestablishes on this basis exponential decay for the modulus of the two--point\nfunction, at all temperatures as well as in the ground state, for a Fermi gas\nwithin the one-particle approximation.

Due to the presence of conical\nsingularities, it is shown that the relation between the zeta-function and the\nheat kernel is non trivial and, as first pointed out by Cheeger, requires a\nseparation between small and large eigenvalues of the Laplace operator. As a\nconsequence, in the massless case, the (naive) non existence of the Mellin\ntransform is by-passed by the Cheeger's analytical continuation of the\nzeta-function on manifold with conical singularities. Furthermore, the\ncontinuous spectrum leads to the introduction of smeared traces. In general, it\nis pointed out that the presence of the divergences may depend on the smearing\nfunction and they arise in removing the smearing cutoff. With a simple choice\nof the smearing function, horizon divergences in the thermodynamical quantities\nare recovered and these are similar to the divergences found by means of\noff-shell methods like the brick wall model, the optical conformal\ntransformation techniques or the canonical path integral method.",

Other distance indicators support this value.\nThe adopted linear distance of 22.0 +/- 0.8 Mpc combined with the cluster\nvelocity of 1178 +/- 32 km s^-1 (in the CMB frame) gives H_0=54 +/- 2 (internal\nerror). (2) Six of the galaxies have been the site of seven SNe Ia with well\nobserved maxima. Their resulting calibration in absolute magnitudes gives\nM_B(max)=-19.53 +/- 0.07 and M_V(max)=-19.49 +/- 0.07 with negligible intrinsic\nscatter. If this calibration is used to determine the distances of all distant\nSNe Ia with known maxima and with 1100 < v < 30'000 km s^-1, H_0 becomes 56 +/-\n3 (internal error).

This work explores these two alternatives through\nthe generation of theoretical cyclotron spectra. For lower field models, a\ncylindrical geometry of the line forming region and the strong angle dependence\nof the cross section for resonant scattering conspire to fill in a first\nharmonic at around 57 keV.

    "summary": "We propose that FU Orionis outbursts may play an important role in\nmaintaining the slow rotation of classical disk-accreting T Tauri stars.\nCurrent estimates for the frequency and duration of FU Orionis outbursts and\nthe mass accretion rates of T Tauri and FU Orionis stars suggest that more mass\nmay be accreted during the outbursts than during the T Tauri phases. If this is\nthe case, then the outbursts should also dominate the accretion of angular\nmomentum. During the outbursts, the accretion rate is so high that the magnetic\nfield of the star should not disrupt the disk, and the disk will extend all the\nway in to the stellar surface. Standard thin disk models then predict that the\nstar should accrete large amounts of angular momentum, which will produce a\nsecular spinup of the star. We present boundary layer solutions for FU Orionis\nparameters which show that the angular momentum accretion rate drops below zero\nfor stellar rotation rates which are always substantially below breakup, but\ndepend on the mass accretion rate and on the adopted definition of the stellar\nradius. When the angular momentum accretion rate drops close to zero, the star\nwill stop spinning up. Faster stellar rotation rates will produce negative\nangular momentum accretion which will spin the star down. Therefore, FU Orionis\noutbursts can keep the stellar rotation rate close to some equilibrium value\nfor which the angular momentum accretion rate is small. We show that this\nequilibrium rotation rate may be similar to the observed rotation rates of T\nTauri stars; thus we propose that FU Orionis outbursts may be responsible for\nthe observed slow rotation of T Tauri stars. This mechanism is independent of\nwhether the disk is disrupted by the stellar magnetic field during the T Tauri\nphase.",

The principal ingredient of\nthe calculation is resummation of the universal leading-logarithm effects of\ngluon radiation to all orders in the quantum chromodynamics coupling strength,\nrestricted to the region of phase space that is demonstrably perturbative. We\nderive the perturbative regime of the resummed series, starting from the\nprincipal-value resummation approach, and we isolate the perturbative domain in\nboth moment space and, upon inversion of the corresponding Mellin transform, in\nmomentum space. We show that our perturbative result does not depend on the\nmanner non-perturbative or infrared effects are handled in principal-value\nresummation.

The deuterium identification is confirmed by its narrow\nwidth and precise agreement with the silicon and carbon redshifts.

The\nsample observed consists of 11 flat-spectrum radio sources known to have red\noptical to infra-red colours plus two steep-spectrum narrow-line radio\ngalaxies. Spectra of the sources were obtained in the 3-, 2- and 1.3-millimetre\nbands at frequencies corresponding to common molecular transitions of CO, HCO+,\nHCN and CS at the AGN redshift. No absorptions were detected in any of the\nsources. We calculated upper limits to the column density in molecular\nabsorption, using an excitation temperature of 10 K, to be N(CO) < 10^{15} -\n10^{16} cm^-2, equivalent to hydrogen columns of order N(H) < 10^{19} - 10^{20}\ncm^-2.\n  These limits are significantly lower than the values N(H) \\approx (2 - 6)\n10^{21} cm^-2 that might be expected if the red colours of these sources were\ndue to dust absorption at the quasar redshift as suggested by Webster et al.\n(1995). Should the excitation temperature of the molecular transitions be\nhigher than 100K, the upper limits to the H2 column densities would be greater\nthan those derived from the red colours. To explain the lack of molecular\nabsorption we conclude that either the optical extinction takes place outside\nthe host galaxy (along the line of sight), or the excitation temperature of the\nmolecular transitions is very high, or the obscuration is not associated with\nsignificant amounts of cold molecular gas. It is quite possible that the hard\nX-ray flux from the central source of these AGN is strong enough to\nphoto-dissociate the molecules.",

    "summary": "We establish exact inequalities for the structure-function scaling exponents\nof a passively advected scalar in both the inertial-convective and\nviscous-convective ranges. These inequalities involve the scaling exponents of\nthe velocity structure functions and, in a refined form, an intermittency\nexponent of the convective-range scalar flux. They are valid for 3D\nNavier-Stokes turbulence and satisfied within errors by present experimental\ndata. The inequalities also hold for any ``synthetic'' turbulent velocity\nstatistics with a finite correlation in time. We show that for time-correlation\nexponents of the velocity smaller than the ``local turnover'' exponent, the\nscalar spectral exponent is strictly less than that in Kraichnan's soluble\n``rapid-change'' model with velocity delta-correlated in time. Our results\ninclude as a special case an exponent-inequality derived previously by\nConstantin \\& Procaccia [Nonlinearity {\\bf 7} 1045 (1994)], but with a more\ndirect proof. The inequalities in their simplest form follow from a\nKolmogorov-type relation for the turbulent passive scalar valid in each space\ndimension $d.$ Our improved inequalities are based upon a rigorous version of\nthe refined similarity hypothesis for passive scalars. These are compared with\nthe relations implied by ``fusion rules'' hypothesized for scalar gradients.",

Quasar companions have been recently identified at\nredshifts up to $z \\approx 3$. Here we report observations of Lyman-$\\alpha$\nemission (a tracer of ionised hydrogen) from the companion to a quasar at\n$z$=4.702, corresponding to a time when the Universe was less than ten per cent\nof its present age. We argue that most of the emission arises in a gaseous\nnebula that has been photoionised by the quasar, but an additional component of\ncontinuum light -perhaps quasar light scattered from dust in the companion\nbody, or emission from young stars within the nebula- appears necessary to\nexplain the observations. These observations may be indicative of the first\nstages in the assembly of galaxy-sized structures.",

    "summary": "Motivated by the observations of high Faraday rotation measures measured in\ncooling flow clusters we propose a model relevant to plasmas with comparable\nthermal and magnetic pressures. Magnetic field reconnection may play a major\nrole in changing the topology of the magnetic field in the central cooling flow\nregions. The effect of the topology change is that cool flux loops can\nreconnect to hot flux loops that are connected to the overall thermal reservoir\nof the cluster. There can be a rapid recycling of mass between hot and cold\nphases on a time scale of 3 x 10^8-10^9 yr which may reduce the inferred inflow\nand mass condensation rates by at least an order of magnitude. A central\nmultiphase medium is a direct consequence of such a model. Throughout the\ncooling flow the filling factor of the hot loops (T > 2 x 10^7 K) is of order\nunity. The filling factor of the cool loops (T < 2 x 10^7 K) is 0.1-1% with a\ncorresponding mass fraction of cold phase of 1-10%. A crucial parameter is the\ncoherence length of the field relative to the cooling radius and the\ndistribution of field energy with scale. When the cooling radius is greater\nthan the field coherence length then cooling flows proceed as usual. When the\ncoherence length is greater than the central cooling radius, however, the\nthermal energy of the reservoir can be tapped and the mass condensation rates\nmay be very significantly reduced. Three additional conditions must be\nsatisfied: I. Cold loops must be able to fall at least as far as the mean\ndistance between hot loops in a cooling time; II. Loops must enter an\nevaporative phase on reconnecting; and III. A sufficient number of hot loops\npenetrate the cold phase region to power the radiative losses.",

Spectral hardening during flux\nincreases was observed in three ROSAT observations.\n  The change in intrinsic photon index and disappearance of the soft excess\ncomponent in the ASCA spectra can be explained as a transition from a first\norder pair reprocessed spectrum to a pair cascade brought about by a sudden\nincrease in the injected electron Lorentz factor. The change in the ionization\nof the warm absorber, though model dependent, could correspond to the increase\nin flux at the oxygen edges resulting from the spectral index change. The ROSAT\nspectral variability can be interpreted by variable intensity hard power law\nand a relatively nonvarying soft component, possibly primary disk emission.\nThese results are compared with those reported from other narrow-line Seyfert 1\ngalaxies.",

A\ndifference in the ellipticity of isochromes and the isophotes can be used to\ndetect the presence of non-circular motion. A model galaxy is constructed which\ndemonstrates this phenomenon. The difference between isochrome and isophote\nellipticity is directly related to the ellipticity of the potential. This\nprovides a new way to measure the ellipticity of the dark matter in the outer\nparts of galaxies.\n  As an example, we apply this technique to two dwarf galaxies NGC 1800 and NGC\n7764.

In NGC 7764 there is no color gradient along its bar so\nwe cannot detect non-circular motion in this region; however ellipticities\nobserved in a star forming ring at the end of the bar are consistent with this\nring being located near the corotation resonance.",

This approach can also readily explain the other claimed ``major\ndiscrepancy'' with the unified scheme, namely, the difference between the radio\nluminosity--size correlations for quasars and radio galaxies.",

Baring\n(1995) found that the spectra of cascades due to photon splitting in a very\nstrong, homogeneous magnetic field can soften spectra and produce good fits to\nthe soft spectra of SGRs. Magnetic field strengths somewhat above the QED\ncritical field strength $B_{\\rm cr}$, where $B_{\\rm cr} = 4.413 \\times 10^{13}$\nG, is required to produce cutoffs at 30-40 keV.

We investigate spectra produced by photons emitted at\ndifferent locations and observer angles. We find that the general results of\nBaring hold for surface emission throughout most of the magnetosphere, but that\nemission in equatorial regions can best reproduce the constancy of SGR spectra\nobserved from different bursts.",

We initiate the first large-scale, multi-line\ninvestigation of correlations between the QSO soft X-ray continuum and UV line\nemission, using an IUE/Einstein sample. We characterize the distributions of\nline equivalent and velocity widths (EW and FWHM) of 85 QSOs in the IUE atlas\nof Lanzetta et al.

We find significant correlations between\nEW and UV luminosity (e.g., the well-studied Baldwin effect) for Lya, CIV,\nHeII, and CIII. EW(CIII) and EW(HeII) show previously unreported correlations\nwith Lx which for CIII appears to be primary. The line ratios CIII/Lya and\nHeII/Lya both show strongest dependence on Lx. EW(Lya) correlates strongly with\nspectral slopes \\alpha_{uv} and \\alpha_{ox}, but NOT with Lx. We argue that one\nsimple geometrical interpretation of the Baldwin effect (BEff) as a result of a\ndistribution of disk inclinations is not plausible. The BEff weakens or\ndisappears when line emission is correctly compared to the luminosity in the\ncontinuum bandpass relevant to its production, which suggests that the BEff is\ndue to a change in SED with luminosity.

The\ncluster masses range between 6 x 10^14 solar masses and 4 x 10^15 solar masses,\nand they are examined at redshifts between 1 and 0. We compute the X-ray\nemission of the intracluster gas by thermal bremsstrahlung, add background\ncontamination, and mimic imaging and spectral observations with current X-ray\ntelescopes. Although the beta model routinely provides excellent fits to the\nX-ray emission profiles, the derived masses are typically biased low because of\nthe restricted range of radii within which the fit can be done. For beta values\nof ~ 2/3, which is the average in our numerically simulated sample, the mass is\ntypically underestimated by ~ 40 per cent. The masses of clusters which exhibit\npronounced substructure are often substantially underestimated. We suggest that\nthe ratio between peak temperature and emission-weighted average cluster\ntemperature may provide a good indicator for ongoing merging and, therefore,\nfor unreliable mass estimates. X-ray mass estimates are substantially improved\nif we fit a King density profile rather than the beta model to the X-ray\nemission, thereby dropping the degree of freedom associated with beta. Clusters\nselected for their strong lensing properties are typically dynamically more\nactive than typical clusters. Bulk flows in the intracluster gas contain a\nlarger than average fraction of the internal energy of the gas in such objects,\nhence the measured gas temperatures are biased low.

New high\nenergy photon diffraction experiments on amorphous germania (at photon energies\nof 97 and 149 keV) are presented, covering the momentum transfer 0.6-33.5\nAA^{-1}. In photon diffraction experiments on GeO2 the contribution of the OO\npairs is very small. To obtain a similar information for amorphous SiO2, high\nenergy photon diffraction experiments have been combined with neutron\ndiffraction data on amorphous silica in order to eliminate the OO- partial\nstructure factor. With this technique it is shown that the Si-O-Si angle\ndistribution is fairly narrow (sigma=7.5 degree) and in fact comparable in\nwidth to the Ge-O-Ge angle distribution (sigma=8.3 degree), a result which\ndiffers from current opinion. The narrower distribution found in this study are\nin much better agreement to the determinations based on 29Si-MAS-NMR.

In this\nmodel pairing in the planes is due to phonons, while Coulomb repulsion induces\nin the chains an order parameter with opposite sign. Due to the anticrossing\nproduced by hybridization between planes and chains, the order parameter\nchanges sign on a single sheet of the Fermi surface resulting in nodes in the\ngap. We find that $T_{c}$ is much less sensitive to impurities than in standard\nd-wave models. One reason is that impurities produce essentially plane-plane\nand chain-chain scattering, which does not affect the critical temperature.\n$T_{c } $ is reduced by plane-chain scattering, which is smaller by a factor of\norder hybridization coupling over Fermi energy. In the specific case which we\nhave studied in details and which reduces to the two-band model, we have found\na further reduction of the sensitivity of $T_{c}$ to impurities with a\nbehaviour which can vary continuously from s-wave like to d-wave like depending\non the parameters.

The principal results of this investigation are as follows: a) for a\ngiven optical luminosity, the typical X-ray luminosity of NELGs is about one or\ntwo orders of magnitude higher than that of normal galaxies; b) the ratio of\nthe surface density of NELGs compared with BLAGN increases from about 0.04 at\nfx >= 6 x 10^{-13} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1} to about 0.1 at fx >= 10^{-14} erg\ncm^{-2} s^{-1}, suggesting that the surface density of NL galaxies might be\nvery close to that of BLAGN at fx ~ 10^{-15} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}; c) we find\nthat these objects are described by a cosmological evolution rate similar to\nthat of soft X-ray selected BLAGN; d) the de-evolved (z=0) XLF of NELGs in the\nluminosity range 10^{41} - 5 x 10^{43} erg s^{-1} is steeper than the BLAGN\n(z=0) XLF in the same luminosity interval. Their spatial density is\nsignificantly lower than the spatial density of X-ray selected BLAGN at Lx(z=0)\n~ 5 x 10^{43} erg s^{-1}, but this difference decreases at lower luminosities\nsuch that at Lx(z=0) < 10^{42} erg s^{-1} the spatial density of NELGs is very\nclose to that of BLAGN. The implications of these results for the contribution\nof this class of objects to the cosmic X-ray background are discussed.",

The present analysis confirms the thermal origin of the bulk\nof the emission in the soft X-ray band (Finley et al. 1992). In addition, we\nfind strong evidence of a harder component, described equally well with a\nblackbody at T about 2x10^6 K, or with a steep power law with photon index\nGamma about 4.5. This bimodal emission is also supported by an analysis of the\nlight curve shape as a function of the energy. The 0.1--2.4 keV light curve of\nPSR 0656+14, with a pulsed fraction of about 9%, is interpreted with a simple\nmodel for the temperature distribution on the neutron star surface, coupled\nwith the geometrical information derived from radio data. In this model, which\nincludes the effects of relativistic light bending and gravitational redshift,\nthe X--rays originate from two thermal components resulting from neutron star\ncooling and blackbody emission released in the hotter polar cap regions. The\nobserved modulation can be reproduced only if PSR 0656+14 has a relatively high\ndipole inclination (about 30 deg) and (1+z) is less than about 1.15. The\noverall pulsed fraction cannot be significantly increased by including the\npolar cap contribution, if its temperature and intensity are to be consistent\nwith the observed spectra.",

In the same energy range the\nbulk of the supersymmetric Higgs corrections to the TGV's is due to the\nlightest neutral Higgs, h_0, whose contribution is like that of a Standard\nModel Higgs of the same mass. The contributions of the Neutralinos and\nCharginos are sensitive to the input value for the soft gaugino mass M_{1/2},\nbeing more pronounced for values M_{1/2} < 100 GeV.

    "summary": "We have studied the dynamics of flux-lines in an impure two-dimensional\nsuperconductor using numerical Brownian dynamics. In the dirty pinning limit\nand for small center-of-mass velocities the flux lines prefer traveling in\nnarrow channels uniquely determined by the pinning configuration. At a certain\ncritical drag force there is a dynamic transition from this glassy state into a\nmore ordered crystalline state, in which the channel structure vanishes. The\nchannels are studied by monitoring the particle trajectories and the spatial\ndistribution of vortices. By explicitly including a Magnus force in the\nLangevin equations of motion we induce a Hall field and we find that the\neffective Hall angle is strongly reduced by the formation of channels, i.e. the\nchannels introduce a transverse energy barrier that guides the motion,\npredominantly in a direction parallel to the external force. The transverse\ndepinning force is larger than the depinning force in the direction of the drag\nand thus the Hall field actually vanishes at finite velocities. We propose that\nthe Hall angle can serve as an order parameter for experimental detection of\nthe glass to crystal transition. Our results are in excellent agreement with\nrecent predictions made by Giamarchi and Le Doussal (cond-mat/9512006).",

The first\nand more straightforward approach is to fit a single ``best'' model to the\noriginal data, and then to generate surrogate data sets that are ``typical\nrealizations'' of that model. The second approach concentrates not on the model\nbut directly on the original data; it attempts to constrain the surrogate data\nsets so that they exactly agree with the original data for a specified set of\nsample statistics. Examples of these two approaches are provided for two simple\ncases: a test for deviations from a gaussian distribution, and a test for\nserial dependence in a time series. Additionally, we consider tests for\nnonlinearity in time series based on a Fourier transform (FT) method and on\nmore conventional autoregressive moving-average (ARMA) fits to the data. The\ncomparative performance of hypothesis testing schemes based on these two\napproaches is found to depend on whether or not the discriminating statistic is\npivotal. A statistic is ``pivotal'' if its distribution is the same for all\nprocesses consistent with the null hypothesis. The typical-realization method\nrequires that the discriminating statistic satisfy this property. The\nconstrained-realization approach, on the other hand, does not share this\nrequirement, and can provide an accurate and powerful test without having to\nsacrifice flexibility in the choice of discriminating statistic.",

The dust optical depth\ntau_{pdr} to the point where 50% of the H is molecular is found to be a simple\nfunction of a dimensionless quantity phi_0 depending on chi/n_H, the rate\ncoefficient for H_2 formation on grains, and the UV dust opacity.

    "summary": "We present a new method for calculating linear cosmic microwave background\n(CMB) anisotropy spectra based on integration over sources along the photon\npast light cone. In this approach the temperature anisotropy is written as a\ntime integral over the product of a geometrical term and a source term. The\ngeometrical term is given by radial eigenfunctions which do not depend on the\nparticular cosmological model. The source term can be expressed in terms of\nphoton, baryon and metric perturbations, all of which can be calculated using a\nsmall number of differential equations. This split clearly separates between\nthe dynamical and geometrical effects on the CMB anisotropies. More\nimportantly, it allows to significantly reduce the computational time compared\nto standard methods. This is achieved because the source term, which depends on\nthe model and is generally the most time consuming part of calculation, is a\nslowly varying function of wavelength and needs to be evaluated only in a small\nnumber of points. The geometrical term, which oscillates much more rapidly than\nthe source term, does not depend on the particular model and can be precomputed\nin advance. Standard methods that do not separate the two terms and require a\nmuch higher number of evaluations. The new method leads to about two orders of\nmagnitude reduction in CPU time when compared to standard methods and typically\nrequires a few minutes on a workstation for a single model. The method should\nbe especially useful for accurate determinations of cosmological parameters\nfrom CMB anisotropy and polarization measurements that will become possible\nwith the next generation of experiments. A programm implementing this method\ncan be obtained from the authors.",

Taken together, these\ncorrections show that there is a direct relationship between pair creation\namplitudes described by the Heisenberg-Euler-Schwinger mechanism and the Unruh\neffect, i.e. the thermalisation of accelerated systems at temperature $a/ 2\n\\pi$ where $a$ is the acceleration. In particular, there is a thermodynamical\nconsistency between both effects whose origin is that the euclidean action\ngoverning pair creation rates acts as an entropy in delivering the Unruh\ntemperature.

These theorems demonstrate the breakdown of\nthe theory at certain `base points' of the Cauchy horizon, which are defined as\n`past terminal accumulation points' of the horizon generators. Thus, the\ntheorems may be interpreted as giving support to Hawking's `Chronology\nProtection Conjecture', according to which the laws of physics prevent one from\nmanufacturing a `time machine'. Specifically, we prove: Theorem 1: There is no\nextension to (M,g_{ab}) of the usual field algebra on the initial globally\nhyperbolic region which satisfies the condition of F-locality at any base\npoint. In other words, any extension of the field algebra must, in any globally\nhyperbolic neighbourhood of any base point, differ from the algebra one would\ndefine on that neighbourhood according to the rules for globally hyperbolic\nspacetimes. Theorem 2: The two-point distribution for any Hadamard state\ndefined on the initial globally hyperbolic region must (when extended to a\ndistributional bisolution of the covariant Klein-Gordon equation on the full\nspacetime) be singular at every base point x in the sense that the difference\nbetween this two point distribution and a local Hadamard distribution cannot be\ngiven by a bounded function in any neighbourhood (in MXM) of (x,x). Theorem 2\nimplies quantities such as the renormalized expectation value of \\phi^2 or of\nthe stress-energy tensor are necessarily ill-defined or singular at any base\npoint. The proofs rely on the `Propagation of Singularities' theorems of\nDuistermaat and H\\\"ormander.",

The energy dependence of the\neigenphases is investigated and the corresponding velocity and curvature\ndistributions are obtained both theoretically and numerically. A simple formula\ndescribing the velocity distribution (and hence the distribution of the Wigner\ntime delay) is derived, which is capable to explain the algebraic tail of the\ntime delay distribution observed recently in microwave experiments. A\ndependence of the eigenphases on other external parameters is also discussed.\nWe show that in the semiclassical limit (large number of channels) the\ncurvature distribution of $S$--matrix eigenphases is the same as that\ncorresponding to the curvature distribution of the underlying Hamiltonian and\nis given by the generalized Cauchy distribution.",

The emerging constituent quark model is one-loop renormalizable\nand interpolates between the phenomenologically successful Nambu-Jona-Lasinio\nmodel at low energies and perturbative QCD at high momenta. Consequently, the\nmomentum dependence of the quark self-energy at high energy coincides with the\nprediction from perturbative QCD. The chiral phase transition is studied in\ndependence on the low energy four quark interaction strength in the\nDyson-Schwinger equation approach. The critical exponents of the quark\nself-energy and the quark condensate are obtained. The latter exponent deviates\nfrom the NJL-result. Pion properties are addressed by means of the\nBethe-Salpeter equation. The validity of the Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation is\nverified.

We confirm that it is with a luminosity\n$L_X(bol)=2\\times 10^{46}$ erg/s the most luminous X-ray cluster discovered to\ndate. The mass of the cluster within 1.7 Mpc is $9.8%\\pm1.1\\times 10^{14}\n\\msol$. A comparison of the central X-ray mass and the mass determined from a\nsimple gravitational lens model shows a discrepancy of a factor of 2-3 with the\nX-ray mass being smaller. The temperature of the cluster is\n$9.3^{+1.1}_{-1.0}$~keV. We detect a strong FeK line corresponding to a\nmetallicity of $0.33\\pm0.10$ in solar units, which is an unexpectedly high\nvalue for a distant and hot cluster. There are several hints that the cluster\ncontains an extremely strong cooling flow. With the usual assumptions we derive\nformally a mass accretion rate of more than 3000 $\\msol$/yr indicating that\nthis may be the largest cooling flow detected so far. To find these extreme\nproperties in this distant cluster which can be taken as an indication of a\nwell relaxed and old system is of high importance for the theory of formation\nand evolution of clusters.",

By dividing the sample spectrum\nby the smoothed one, a white-noise like spectrum is obtained, the approximate\nprobability distribution of which is derived. A search for coherent pulsations\nis then carried out by looking for peaks in the divided spectrum, the chance\nprobability of which is below a given detection threshold. The technique is\ntested and its range of applicability determined through extensive numerical\nsimulations.

The statistical distribution of density peaks and dark\nmatter halos within the initial density field are determined by the peak\nformalism and by an extension of the Press-Schechter formalism, respectively.\nModifications of these distributions caused by gravitationally induced motions\nare treated using a spherical collapse model. We test our model against results\nfrom a variety of N-body simulations. The model works well for peaks and for\nhalos that are identified earlier than the time when the moments are\ncalculated. Because halos are spatially exclusive at the time of their\nidentification, our model is only qualitatively correct for halos identified at\nthe same time as the moments are calculated. The S_j depend only weakly on the\nbias parameter b for large b but increase rapidly with decreasing b at b\\sim 1.\nThus if galaxies are associated with peaks in the initial density field, or\nwith dark halos formed at high redshifts, a measurement of S_j in the\nquasilinear regime should determine whether galaxies are significantly biased\nrelative to the mass. We use our model to interpret the observed high order\ncorrelation functions of galaxies and clusters.

Positions\nof the K-matrix poles (which are referred to the masses of bare states) are at\n$750\\pm 120$ MeV, $1240\\pm 30$ MeV, $1280\\pm 30$ MeV and $1615\\pm 40$ MeV.\nCoupling constants of the K-matrix poles to the $\\pi\\pi$, $\\eta\\eta$ and $K\\bar\nK$ channels are found that allow us to analyze the quark and gluonic content of\nbare states.

    "summary": "In the light of recent discovery of a very heavy top quark, we reexamine the\ntop quark condensate model proposed by Miransky, Tanabashi and Yamawaki (MTY)\nand by Nambu. We first review the original MTY formulation based on the ladder\nSchwinger-Dyson equation and the Pagels-Stokar formula. It is particularly\nemphasized that the critical phenomenon gives a simple reason why the top quark\ncan have an extremely large mass compared with other quarks and leptons. Then\nwe discuss the Bardeen-Hill-Lindner (BHL) formulation based on the\nrenormalization-group equation and the compositeness condition, which\nsuccessfully picks up 1/N_c-sub-leading effects disregarded by MTY. In fact BHL\nis equivalent to MTY at the 1/N_c-leading order. Such a simplest version of the\nmodel predicts the top quark mass, m_t \\simeq 250 GeV (MTY) and m_t \\simeq 220\nGeV (BHL), for the cutoff on the Planck scale. In this version we cannot take\nthe cutoff beyond the Landau pole of U(1)_Y gauge coupling, which yields a\nminimum value of the top mass prediction m_t \\simeq 200 GeV. We then propose a\n``top mode walking GUT'' : The standard gauge groups are unified into a\n(``walking'') GUT so that the cutoff can be taken to infinity thanks to the\nrenormalizability of the four-fermion theory coupled to ``walking'' gauge\ntheory. The top and Higgs mass prediction is then controlled by the\nPendleton-Ross infrared fixed point at GUT scale and can naturally lead to m_t\n\\simeq m_H \\simeq 180 GeV.",

We find that while the qualitative\ndistributions of the cluster light and the dark matter are similar -- shallow\nand extended, with significant substructure -- the X-ray morphology shows a\nmore regular overall appearance. We interpret the joint lensing and X-ray\nobservations as a signature of a merger event in the cluster. We present new\nROSAT/HRI data and reanalyze ROSAT/PSPC data, accounting for the effect of a\nvarying background to determine the best fit parameters in the $\\beta$-model\nformalism. We combine the surface brightness fits with two determinations of\nthe radial temperature profile to determine the total mass. Although there are\nslight variations in the total mass determinations introduced by the\nuncertainties in the $\\beta$-fit, the main contributor to the error arises from\nthe uncertainties in the temperature determinations. Even though the\nmorphologies of the dark matter/light and X-ray gas are quite different, we\nfind that the total mass determined from the X-ray and weak lensing estimates\nare consistent with each other within the $2\\sigma$ error bars, with the X-ray\ninferred mass a factor of $\\simeq 2$ larger. However, as the lensing mass\nestimates are differential (the surface density at any point is determined\nrelative to the mean in a control annulus), the shallow, extended nature of the\nmass profile biases the lensing inferred mass downwards. We estimate the\ncorrection for this effect and find very good agreement between the corrected\nlensing and X-ray results. We determine the gas mass fraction and find $f_g\n\\simeq 0.07h^{-3/2}$ at all radii and a constant mass-to-light ratio of $M/L_V",

The latter process is calculated within the modified perturbative\napproach to hard exclusive reactions. A simultaneous fit to the three sets of\ndata leads to a wave function whose $x$-dependent part, the distribution\namplitude, shows the same type of asymmetry as those distribution amplitudes\nconstrained by QCD sum rules. The asymmetry is however much more moderate as in\nthose amplitudes. Our distribution amplitude resembles the asymptotic one in\nshape but the position of the maximum is somewhat shifted.",

We show\nthat the ratio of shear rate to viscosity must be small if one wants to find\nsize segregation. In this case the particles in the system arrange themselves\nin bands of big and small particles oriented along the direction of the flow.\nSimilarly, in Poiseuille flow we find the formation of particle bands. Here, in\naddition, the variety of time scales in the flow leads to an aggregation of\nparticles in the zones of low shear rate and can suppress size segregation in\nthese regions.

A\ntopology-independent algorithm is presented which is complementary to that of\nLehoucq et al. 1996 and which searches for evidence of multi-connectedness\nusing catalogues of astrophysically observed objects. The basis of this\nalgorithm is simply to search for a quintuplet of quasars (over a region of a\nfew hundred comoving Mpc) which can be seen in two different parts of our past\ntime cone, allowing for a translation, an arbitrary rotation and possibly a\nreflection. This algorithm is demonstrated by application to the distribution\nof quasars between redshifts of $z=1$ and $z\\approx4,$ i.e., at a comoving\ndistance from the observer $1700 h^{-1}\\mbox{\\rm Mpc} \\ltapprox d \\ltapprox\n3300 h^{-1}\\mbox{\\rm Mpc}.$ Two pairs of isometric quintuplets separated by\nmore than {$300$\\hMpc} are found. This is consistent with the number expected\nfrom Monte Carlo simulations in a simply connected Universe if the detailed\nanisotropy of sky coverage by the individual quasar surveys is taken into\naccount. The linear transformation in (flat) comoving space from one quintuplet\nto another requires translations of {$353$\\hMpc} and {4922\\hMpc} respectively,\nplus a reflection in the former case, and plus both a rotation and a reflection\nin the latter. Since reflections are required, if these two matches were due to\nmulti-connectedness, then the Universe would be non-orientable.",

    "summary": "The dynamical behavior of an acoustic polaron in typical non-degenerate\nconjugated polymer, polydiacetylene, is numerically studied by using\nSu-Schrieffer-Heeger's model for the one dimensional electron-lattice system.\nIt is confirmed that the velocity of a polaron accelerated by a constant\nelectric field shows a saturation to a velocity close to the sound velocity of\nthe system, and that the width of a moving polaron decreases as a monotonic\nfunction of the velocity tending to zero at the saturation velocity. The\neffective mass of a polaron is estimated to be about one hundred times as heavy\nas the bare electron mass. Furthermore the linear mode analysis in the presence\nof a polaron is carried out, leading to the conclusion that there is only one\nlocalized mode, i.e. the translational mode. This is confirmed also from the\nphase shift of extended modes. There is no localized mode corresponding to the\namplitude mode in the case of the soliton in polyacetylene. Nevertheless the\nwidth of a moving polaron shows small oscillations in time. This is found to be\nrelated to the lowest odd symmetry extended mode and to be due to the finite\nsize effect.",

The requirement of this\nrenormalizability/nontriviality of the gauged NJL model can be applied to the\ntop quark condensate when the standard gauge groups are unified into a GUT with\n``walking'' coupling, which then naturally leads to the top quark and the Higgs\nmasses both around 180 GeV.",

In the latter, nonlinear\nprocess, fragments react at collision to produce an inert species, causing loss\nof mass. We analyse these systems in the reaction-limited regime by solving a\ncontinuous model within the mean-field approximation. The rate of\nfragmentation, for a particle of mass $x$ to break into fragments of masses $y$\nand $x-y$, has the form $x^{\\lambda-1}$ ($\\lambda>0$), and the annihilation\nrate is constant and independent of the masses of the reactants. We find that\nthe asymptotic regime is characterized by the annihilation of small-mass\nclusters. The results are compared with those for a model with linear mass-loss\n(i.e.\\ with a sink). We also study more complex models, in which the processes\nof fragmentation and annihilation are controlled by mutually-reacting\ncatalysts. Both pair- and linear-annihilation are considered. Depending on the\nspecific model and initial densities of the catalysts, the time-decay of the\ncluster-density can now be very unconventional and even non-universal. The\ninterplay between the intervening processes and the existence of a scaling\nregime are determined by the asymptotic behaviour of the average-mass and of\nthe mass-density, which may either decay indefinitely or tend to a constant\nvalue.

The absence of a background space-time metric in these\ntheories gives rise to a host of conceptual and technical difficulties because\nmost of the familiar methods from axiomatic, constructive and perturbative\nquantum field theory are no longer applicable. Perhaps the most striking\nexamples of these problems arise in the construction of a quantum field theory\nof geometry. We show that these problems can be tackled using new\nnon-perturbative methods. In particular, one can rigorously define certain\ngeometric operators and show that their spectrum is discrete. Thus, there is a\nprecise sense in which the geometry is quantized at the Planck scale and the\ncontinuum picture is only a coarse-grained approximation.",

    "summary": "We present HST Planetary Camera V and I~band images of the central region of\nthe peculiar giant elliptical galaxy NGC 1316. The inner profile is well fit by\na nonisothermal core model with a core radius of 0.41\" +/- 0.02\" (34 pc). At an\nassumed distance of 16.9 Mpc, the deprojected luminosity density reaches $\\sim\n2.0 \\times 10^3 L_{\\sun}$ pc$^{-3}$.\n  Outside the inner two or three arcseconds, a constant mass-to-light ratio of\n$\\sim 2.2 \\pm 0.2$ is found to fit the observed line width measurements. The\nline width measurements of the center indicate the existence of either a\ncentral dark object of mass $2 \\times 10^9 M_{\\sun}$, an increase in the\nstellar mass-to-light ratio by at least a factor of two for the inner few\narcseconds, or perhaps increasing radial orbit anisotropy towards the center.\nThe mass-to-light ratio run in the center of NGC 1316 resembles that of many\nother giant ellipticals, some of which are known from other evidence to harbor\ncentral massive dark objects (MDO's).\n  We also examine twenty globular clusters associated with NGC 1316 and report\ntheir brightnesses, colors, and limits on tidal radii. The brightest cluster\nhas a luminosity of $9.9 \\times 10^6 L_{\\sun}$ ($M_V = -12.7$), and the\nfaintest detectable cluster has a luminosity of $2.4 \\times 10^5 L_{\\sun}$\n($M_V = -8.6$). The globular clusters are just barely resolved, but their core\nradii are too small to be measured. The tidal radii in this region appear to be\n$\\le$ 35 pc. Although this galaxy seems to have undergone a substantial merger\nin the recent past, young globular clusters are not detected.",

    "summary": "It has been known for some time that the (1,3) perturbations of the (2k+1,2)\nVirasoro minimal models have conserved currents which are also singular vectors\nof the Virasoro algebra. This also turns out to hold for the (1,2) perturbation\nof the (3k+-1,3) models. In this paper we investigate the requirement that a\nperturbation of an extended conformal field theory has conserved currents which\nare also singular vectors. We consider conformal field theories with W3 and\n(bosonic) WBC2 = W(2,4) extended symmetries. Our analysis relies heavily on the\ngeneral conjecture of de Vos and van Driel relating the multiplicities of\nW-algebra irreducible modules to the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials of a certain\ndouble coset. Granting this conjecture, the singular-vector argument provides a\ndirect way of recovering all known integrable perturbations. However, W models\nbring a slight complication in that the conserved densities of some (1,2)-type\nperturbations are actually subsingular vectors, that is, they become singular\nvectors only in a quotient module.",

The ASCA spectrum shows a lightly absorbed power law\nof energy index 0.78. The low energy absorbing column is significantly less\nthan previously seen. Prominent O~vii and O~viii absorption edges are visible,\nbut, consistent with the much lower total absorbing column, no Fe K absorption\nedge is detectable. A weak, narrow Fe~K$\\alpha$ emission line from cold\nmaterial is present as well as a broad Fe~K$\\alpha$ line. These features are\nsimilar to those reported in other Seyfert 1 galaxies. A single warm absorber\nmodel provides only an imperfect description of the low energy absorption. In\naddition to a highly ionized absorber with ionization parameter $U = 1.66$ and\na total column density of $1.4 \\times 10^{22}~\\rm cm^{-2}$, adding a lower\nionization absorber with $U = 0.32$ and a total column of $6.9 \\times\n10^{21}~\\rm cm^{-2}$ significantly improves the fit. The contribution of\nresonant line scattering to our warm absorber models limits the Doppler\nparameter to $< 160~\\rm km~s^{-1}$ at 90\\% confidence. Turbulence at the sound\nspeed of the photoionized gas provides the best fit. None of the warm absorber\nmodels fit to the X-ray spectrum can match the observed equivalent widths of\nall the UV absorption lines. Accounting for the X-ray and UV absorption\nsimultaneously requires an absorbing region with a broad range of ionization\nparameters and column densities.",

In this paper, we\npoint out physical arguments that favor a mean-field transition, not only for\nzero density and high temperature, but also for finite density. We show, using\nthe Gross-Neveu model in 3 spatial dimensions in mean-field approximation, how\nthe phase transition is constructed.

The first type is a weak chaos, where only a small chaotic\ndeviation from the periodic solution occurs. The second type corresponds to the\ndeveloped chaos where the solution ``ignores'' the driver period and represents\na random sequence of uncorrelated shocks. In the case of weak chaos the shock\ncoordinate being repeatedly mapped over the driver period moves on a chaotic\nattractor, while in the case of developed chaos it moves on a repellor. Both\nsolutions depend on a parameter indicating the reference shock position in the\nshock-train. The structure of a one dimensional set to which this parameter\nbelongs is investigated. This set contains measure one intervals around the\nfixed points in the case of periodic or weakly chaotic solutions and it becomes\na fractal in the case of strong chaos.

Applications of this result to\nfiniteness and holomorphic extendibility of such mappings are also given.

Both in the continuum and on the lattice, when the\nbackground consists of sufficiently large constant gauge potentials the action\ninduced by the fermions varies significantly under certain singular gauge\ntransformations. ``Ruling away'' such discontinuities cannot be justified in\nthe continuum framework and does not naturally fit on the lattice.

I explain the sense in which the light-cone vacuum is\n``trivial,'' and describe a way of setting up a quantum field theory on null\nplanes so that it is equivalent to the usual equal-time formulation. This\nconstruction is quite helpful in resolving the puzzling aspects of the\nlight-cone formalism. It furthermore allows the extraction of effective\nHamiltonians that incorporate vacuum physics, but that act in a Hilbert space\nin which the vacuum state is simple. The discussion is fairly informal, and\nfocuses mainly on the conceptual issues. [Talk presented at {\\sc Orbis\nScientiae 1996}, Miami Beach, FL, January 25--28, 1996.
