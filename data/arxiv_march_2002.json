Of the two solutions, the one that includes a condensate has a lower\nfree energy at all temperatures. However, the Hartree-Fock scheme neglects the\npresence of phonons within the system, and when we allow for the possibility of\nphonons we are unable to find condensed solutions; the uncondensed solutions,\non the other hand, are valid also in the latter, more general scheme. Our\nresults confirm that low-energy phonons destabilize the two-dimensional\ncondensate.",

In this\narticle, we show that $P_f$ also has a strong impact on the distribution of\nzeros of one or several polynomials. We equip the space of (holomorphic)\npolynomials of degree $\\leq N$ in $m$ complex variables with its usual\n$SU(m+1)$-invariant Gaussian measure and then consider the conditional measures\n$\\gamma_{|NP}$ induced on the subspace of polynomials whose Newton polytope\n$P_f\\subset NP$. When $P=\\Sigma$, the unit simplex, then it is obvious and\nwell-known that the expected distribution of zeros $Z_{f_1,...,f_k}$ (regarded\nas a current) of $k$ polynomials $f_1,...,f_k$ of degree $N$ is uniform\nrelative to the Fubini-Study form. Our main results concern the conditional\nexpectation $E_{|NP} (Z_{f_1,...,f_k})$ of zeros of $k$ polynomials with Newton\npolytope $NP\\subset Np\\Sigma$ (where $p=\\deg P$); these results are asymptotic\nas the scaling factor $N\\to\\infty$.

We show\nthat the micro-pulse width in pulsars has a period dependence. Like individual\npulses, Vela's micro-pulses are highly elliptically polarized. There is a\nstrong correlation between Stokes parameters V and I in the micro-structure. We\nshow that the V/I distribution is Gaussian with a narrow width and that this\nwidth appears to be constant as a function of pulse phase. The phase-resolved\nintensity distributions of I are best fitted with log-normal statistics. Extra\nemission components, i.e.``bump'' and ``giant micro-pulses'', discovered by\nJohnston et al.(2001) are also present at 2.3 GHz. The bump component seems to\nbe an extra component superposed on the main pulse profile but does not appear\nperiodically. The giant micro-pulses are time-resolved and have significant\njitter in their arrival times. Their flux density distribution is best fitted\nby a power-law, indicating a link between these features and ``classical''\ngiant pulses as observed for the Crab pulsar, (PSR B0531+21), PSR B1937+21 and\nPSR B1821-24. We find that Vela contains a mixture of emission properties\nrepresenting both ``classical'' properties of radio pulsars (e.g.\nmicro-structure, high degree of polarization, S-like position angle swing,\northogonal modes) and features which are most likely related to high-energy\nemission (e.g. extra profile components, giant micro-pulses).

Continuous transition to new energy ground state close to the\ntransition from \"heavy\" polaron phase to \"light\" (bi)polaron phase occurs. In\nthe \"heavy\" phase, there occurs anomalous (anharmonic) enhancements of quantum\nfluctuations of the phonon coordinate, momentum and their product as functions\nof the effective coupling. (ii) Dependence of the polaron mass on the optical\nphonon frequency appears.(iii) Rabi oscillations significantly enhance quantum\nshift of the insulator-metal transition line to higher values of the critical\neffective e-ph coupling supporting so the metallic phase. In the E-e JT case,\ninsulator-metal transition coincide with the transition between the \"heavy\" and\nthe \"light\" (bi)polaron phase at certain (strong) effective e-ph interaction.",

The latter are\nassociated with phenomenologically safe ultra-light scalar fields. Bulk fields\nCasimir energy naturally plays the role of dark energy, which decreases in time\nbecause of expanding r_l. Stable Kaluza Klein states may play the role of dark\nmatter with increasing, O(1/r_s), mass. The cosmological equations exhibit\nattractor solutions in which the global equation of state is negative, the\nratio between dark energy and dark matter is constant and the observed value of\nthe ratio is obtained for two large extra dimensions.

We study corrections at the\nnext-to-leading order in the framework of nonrelativistic QCD(NRQCD)\nfactorization. The study presented here is different than previous approaches\nwhere chi_{c0,2} is taken as a bound-state of a c cbar pair and a\nnonrelativistic wave-function is used for the pair. We find that the\ncorrections are consist not only of relativistic corrections, but also of\ncorrections from Fock state components of chi_{c0,2} in which the c cbar pair\nis in a color-octet state. For chi_{c2} there is also a contribution from a\nFock state component in which the pair is in a F-wave state. We determine the\nfactorization formula for decay widths in the form of NRQCD matrix elements\nrepresenting nonperturbative effects related to chi_{c0,2}, and calculate the\nperturbative coefficients at tree-level. Because the NRQCD matrix elements are\nunknown, a detailed prediction for the decay chi_{c0,2} --> gamma gamma can not\nbe made, but the effect of these corrections can be determined at certain\nlevel.

By means of a strictly\ndifferential 1D/2D comparison of the emergent equivalent widths, we have\nderived \"granulation abundance corrections\" for individual lines, which have to\nbe applied to standard abundance determinations based on homogeneous 1D model\natmospheres in order to correct for the influence of the photospheric\ntemperature fluctuations.

We model the\nactual magnetic field as the sum of global dipolar and star-centered multipolar\nfields. In configurations involving axially symmetric and uniform multipolar\nfields, 'neutral points' and 'neutral lines' exist close to the stellar\nsurface. Also, the curvature radii of magnetic field lines near the stellar\nsurface can never be smaller than the stellar radius, even for very high order\nmultipoles. Consequently, such configurations are unable to provide an\nefficient pair creation process above pulsar polar caps, necessary for plasma\nmechanisms of generation of pulsar radiation. In configurations involving\naxially symmetric and non-uniform multipoles, the periphery of the pulsar polar\ncap becomes fragmented into symmetrically distributed narrow sub-regions where\ncurvature radii of complex magnetic field lines are less than the radius of the\nstar. The pair production process is only possible just above these\n'favourable' sub-regions. As a result, the pair plasma flow is confined within\nnarrow filaments regularly distributed around the margin of the open magnetic\nflux tube. Such a magnetic topology allows us to model the system of twenty\nisolated sub-beams observed in PSR B0943+10 by Deshpande & Rankin (1999, 2001).\nWe suggest a physical mechanism for the generation of pulsar radio emission in\nthe ensemble of finite sub-beams, based on specific instabilities.

We report a measurement of this `cosmic shear'\nbased on 271 WFPC2 archival images from the Hubble Space Telescope Medium Deep\nSurvey (MDS). Our measurement method and treatment of systematic effects were\ndiscussed in an earlier paper. We measure the shear variance on scales ranging\nfrom 0.7' to 1.4', with a detection significance greater than 3.8. This allows\nus to measure the normalization of the matter power spectrum to be sigma8 =\n(0.94 +/- 0.10 +/- 0.14) (0.3/Omega_m)^0.44 (0.21/Gamma)^0.15, in a LCDM\nuniverse. The first 1sigma error includes statistical errors only, while the\nlatter also includes (gaussian) cosmic variance and the uncertainty in the\ngalaxy redshift distribution. Our results are consistent with earlier cosmic\nshear measurements from the ground and from space. We compare our cosmic shear\nresults and those from other groups to the normalization from cluster abundance\nand galaxy surveys. We find that the combination of four recent cosmic shear\nmeasurements are somewhat inconsistent with the recent normalization using\nthese methods, and discuss possible explanations for the discrepancy.",

In the limit of infinite range of the interactions, systems\nwill exhibit mean-field critical behavior, i.e., critical behavior not affected\nby fluctuations of the order parameter. If the interaction range is finite, the\ncritical behavior asymptotically close to the critical point is determined by\nfluctuations and the actual critical behavior depends on the particular\nuniversality class. A variety of systems, including fluids and anisotropic\nferromagnets, belongs to the three-dimensional Ising universality class. Recent\nnumerical studies of Ising models with different interaction ranges have\nrevealed a spectacular crossover between the asymptotic fluctuation-induced\ncritical behavior and mean-field-type critical behavior. In this work, we\ncompare these numerical results with a crossover Landau model based on\nrenormalization-group matching. For this purpose we consider an application of\nthe crossover Landau model to the three-dimensional Ising model without fitting\nto any adjustable parameters. The crossover behavior of the critical\nsusceptibility and of the order parameter is analyzed over a broad range (ten\norders) of the scaled distance to the critical temperature. The dependence of\nthe coupling constant on the interaction range, governing the crossover\ncritical behavior, is discussed",

Here, we present a new cosmic shear survey carried out with the\nEchelle Spectrograph and Imager on the Keck II telescope. This covers a total\nof 0.6 square degrees in 173 fields probing independent lines of sight, hence\nminimising the impact of sample variance. We also extend our measurements of\ncosmic shear with the William Herschel Telescope (Bacon, Refregier & Ellis\n2000) to a survey area of 1 square degree. The joint measurements with two\nindependent telescopes allow us to assess the impact of instrument-specific\nsystematics, one of the major difficulties in cosmic shear measurements. For\nboth surveys, we carefully account for effects such as smearing by the point\nspread function and shearing due to telescope optics. We find negligible\nresiduals in both cases and recover mutually consistent cosmic shear signals,\nsignificant at the 5.1 sigma level. We present a simple method to compute the\nstatistical error in the shear correlation function, including non-gaussian\nsample variance and the covariance between different angular bins. We measure\nshear correlation functions for all fields and use these to ascertain the\namplitude of the matter power spectrum, finding sigma_8 (Omega_m/0.3)^0.68 =\n0.97 \\pm 0.13 with 0.14<Omega_m<0.65 in a Lambda-CDM model with Gamma=0.21.\nThese 68% CL uncertainties include sample variance, statistical noise, redshift\nuncertainty, and the error in the shear measurement method. The results from\nour two independent surveys are both consistent with measurements of cosmic\nshear from other groups.

Both the magnetization and the resistivity are critically dependent\non the film thickness. $T_{c}$ is enhanced with decreasing the film thickness\ndue to the compressive stain produced by lattice mismatch. The resistivity\nabove 165 K of the films with various thicknesses is consistent with small\npolaronic hopping conductivity. The polaronic formation energy $E_{P}$ is\nreduced with the decrease of film thickness. We found that the strain\ndependence of $T_{c}$ mainly results from the strain-induced electron-phonon\ncoupling. The strain effect on $E_{P}$ is in good agreement with the\ntheoretical predictions.",

Our main findings are: (i) The lensing\nprobability should be 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than for conventional\nsurveys. The expected fraction of multiply-imaged quasars is highly sensitive\nto redshift and the uncertain slope of the bright end of the luminosity\nfunction, beta_h. For beta_h=2.58 (3.43) we find that at z~4.3 and i*<20.0 the\nfraction is ~4% (13%) while at z~6 and z*<20.2 the fraction is ~7% (30%). (ii)\nThe distribution of magnifications is heavily skewed; sources having the\nredshift and luminosity of the SDSS z>5.8 quasars acquire median magnifications\nof med(mu_obs)~1.1-1.3 and mean magnifications of <mu_obs>~5-50. Estimates of\nthe quasar luminosity density at high redshift must therefore filter out\ngravitationally-lensed sources. (iii) The flux in the Gunn-Peterson trough of\nthe highest redshift (z=6.28) quasar is known to be f_lambda<3 10^-19\nerg/sec/cm^2/Angstrom. Should this quasar be multiply imaged, we estimate a 40%\nchance that light from the lens galaxy would have contaminated the same part of\nthe quasar spectrum with a higher flux. Hence, spectroscopic studies of the\nepoch of reionization need to account for the possibility that a lens galaxy,\nwhich boosts the quasar flux, also contaminates the Gunn-Peterson trough. (iv)\nMicrolensing by stars should result in ~1/3 of multiply imaged quasars in the\nz>5.8 catalog varying by more than 0.5 magnitudes over the next decade.

The four stars studied in this paper are hotter (T$_{\\rm eff}$ =\n15-20 kK) than the majority of RCB stars (T$_{\\rm eff}$ = 5000-7000 K).\nAlthough these are commonly grouped together as the \\emph{hot RCB stars} they\ndo not necessarily share a common evolutionary history. We present new\nobservational data and an extensive collection of archival and\npreviously-published data which is reassessed to ensure internal consistency.\nWe find temporal variations of various properties on different time scales\nwhich will eventually help us to uncover the evolutionary history of these\nobjects. DY Cen and MV Sgr have typical RCB helium abundances which excludes\nany currently known post-AGB evolutionary models. Moreover, their carbon and\nnitrogen abundances present us with further problems for their interpretation.\nV348 Sgr and HV 2671 are in general agreement with a born-again post-AGB\nevolution and their abundances are similar to Wolf-Rayet central stars of PN.\nThe three Galactic stars in the sample have circumstellar nebulae which produce\nforbidden line radiation (for HV 2671 we have no information).

This orbital\nperiod suggests that V101 has a secondary of mid to late K spectral type with\nMv = +8.2 +- 0.5. The predicted spectral type is consistent with previous\nspectral observations in quiescence which show a fairly red continuum. From the\nobserved minimum brightness of V = 22.5, we derive a distance modulus of (m -\nM)v = 14.3 +- 0.5 to the DN which supports V101's membership in the globular\ncluster M5.

They display a weak covalent bonding between O 2s/2p states and\nminority-spin d states of Mn_2, which is absent in a fully ionic picture. This\nbonding is the fingerprint of the interaction responsible for the AFM ordering,\nand its strength depends on the one-electron scheme being used. The five Mn\nWannier functions are centered on the Mn_1 site, and are atomic orbitals\nmodified by the crystal field. They are not uniquely defined by the criterion\nof maximal localization and we choose them as the linear combinations which\ndiagonalize the r^2 operator, so that they display the D_3d symmetry of the\nMn_1 site.",

On the other hand,\ntangential arcs are much less sensitive to the source size. Next we numerically\ncalculate the cross section for arcs considering the lens and source\nellipticities. We find that the numbers of both tangential and radial arcs are\nhighly enhanced by both ellipticities, by one or two orders of magnitude. The\nnumber ratio of radial to tangential arcs is, however, not so affected if the\nthreshold axis ratio of arcs is large (\\gtrsim 7). The number ratio therefore\nstill remains good statistics which probe the density profile of the lens\nobjects, if the source size effect is correctly taken into account.",

The results of a model atmosphere analysis\nare consistent with our mass estimated from the orbit. Temperatures of the\nindividual components are also determined.

    "summary": "We use a novel statistical tool, the mark correlation functions (MCFs), to\nstudy clustering of galaxy-size halos as a function of their properties and\nenvironment in a high-resolution numerical simulation of the LambdaCDM\ncosmology. We applied MCFs using several types of continuous and discrete\nmarks: maximum circular velocity of halos, merger mark indicating whether halos\nexperienced or not a major merger in their evolution history, and a stripping\nmark indicating whether the halo underwent a tidal stripping. We find that\nhalos which experienced a relatively early (z>1) major merger or mass loss (due\nto tidal stripping) in their evolution histories are over-abundant in halo\npairs with separations < 3 Mpc/h. This result can be interpreted as spatial\nsegregation of halos with different merger histories, qualitatively similar to\nthe morphological segregation in the observed galaxy distribution. The analysis\npresented in this paper demonstrate that MCFs provide powerful, yet\nalgorithmically simple, quantitative measures of segregation in the spatial\ndistribution of objects with respect to their various properties (marks).",

We investigate in detail the\n(Atiyah-Patodi-Singer)-rho-invariant for manifolds with boundary. First we\ngeneralize the cut-and-paste formula to arbitrary boundary conditions. A priori\nthe rho-invariant is an invariant of the Riemannian structure and a\nrepresentation of the fundamental group. We show, however, that the dependence\non the metric is only very mild: it is independent of the metric in the\ninterior and the dependence on the metric on the boundary is only up to its\npseudo--isotopy class. Furthermore, we show that this cannot be improved: we\ngive explicit examples and a theoretical argument that different metrics on the\nboundary in general give rise to different rho-invariants. Theoretically, this\nfollows from an interpretation of the exponentiated rho-invariant as a\ncovariantly constant section of a determinant bundle over a certain moduli\nspace of flat connections and Riemannian metrics on the boundary. Finally we\nextend to manifolds with boundary the results of Farber-Levine-Weinberger\nconcerning the homotopy invariance of the rho-invariant and spectral flow of\nthe odd signature operator.",

In comparison with the same elements observed\nin damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) systems along QSO sight lines, we find evidence for\nmuch higher column densities of ZnII. The gap between the QSO-DLA and GRB-DLA\ndistributions is smoothly bridged by observations of the interstellar\nabsorption in the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds. Very small [Fe/Zn],\n[Si/Zn], and [Cr/Zn] values in GRB-DLAs indicate large dust depletions. Once\nthe dust-to-metals ratios are determined, we find an optical extinction A_V ~ 1\nmags, to be compared with typical A_V < 0.1 in most QSO-DLAs. Our inference of\nhigh dust content appears to be in contradiction with the typical low reddening\npreviously found in GRBs. One possible way to reconcile is a dust grain-size\ndistribution biased towards big grains, which would give a grey extinction.\nPossibly the small dust grains have been destroyed by the GRBs themselves. Our\nfindings support the idea that primarily optically selected QSOs probe mainly\nlow gas/dust regions of high redshift galaxies, while the more powerful GRBs\ncan be detected through denser regions of their ISM (molecular clouds and star\nforming regions).

(b) Anomalous low\naltitude fireballs which (in some cases) have been observed to hit the ground.\nThe absence of fragments is particularly striking in these cases, but this is\nnot the only reason they are anomalous. On the other hand, there is strong\nevidence that most of our galaxy is made from exotic dark material - `dark\nmatter'. Mirror matter is one well motivated dark matter candidate, since it is\ndark and stable and it is required to exist if particle interactions are mirror\nsymmetric. If mirror matter is the dark matter, then some amount must exist in\nour solar system. We demonstrate that the mirror matter theory allows for a\nsimple explanation for the puzzling meteoritic events [both (a) and (b)] if\nthey are due to mirror matter space-bodies. A direct consequence of this\nexplanation is that mirror matter fragments should exist in (or on) the ground\nat various impact sites. The properties of this potentially recoverable\nmaterial depend importantly on the sign of the photon-mirror photon kinetic\nmixing parameter, $\\epsilon$.

    "summary": "We have obtained the first beryllium measurements of late F/early G-type\nstars in the old open cluster M67 (4.5 Gyr) and in the intermediate age cluster\nIC 4651 (1.7 Gyr). One member of the young cluster IC 2391 (~50 Myr) was also\nobserved. Our sample stars have effective temperatures within a range of +30 -\n+380 K from the solar temperature. All our sample stars, including the Sun and\nthe young cluster star have, within the errors, the same Be abundance. This\nresult implies that late F/early G-type stars undergo very little (if any) Be\ndepletion during their main-sequence life-time. Since these stars have\nundergone some Li depletion, our finding is indicative of shallow mixing, i.e.\nof a mixing process that can transport surface material deep enough for Li\nburning to occur, but not deep enough for Be burning. As shown in previous\nstudies, the Li vs. Be diagram is a powerful diagnostic of stellar interiors.\nIn this context, we do not find any evidence of correlated Li and Be depletion;\nfurthermore, a comparison with various models shows that the Be pattern of our\nsample stars is compatible only with models including gravity waves. This class\nof models, however, cannot reproduce the Li observations of M 67.",

Below the upper critical field $H_{\\rm\nc2}$ of about 7 T, the additional damping of the SdH oscillation amplitude\nappears, as well as that of the de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) oscillations, with\nrespect to the normal state one which is described with the standard\nLifshitz-Kosevich formula. The magnitude of the additional damping near $H_{\\rm\nc2}$ is the same with that observed in the dHvA oscillations and well explained\nby the theoretical predictions in consideration of fluctuations in the thermal\nvortex liquid state. In the quantum fluctuation region at lower temperature,\nhowever, only SdH effect shows the stronger damping than that of the dHvA\noscillations. The different magnetic field dependence of the additional damping\nof the oscillation amplitude between the SdH and dHvA effects is discussed in\nconnection with the effect of the transport current on the short-range order of\nvortices in the quantum vortex slush state reported at the same temperature and\nmagnetic field region.",

This sample is many times larger than those used in\nprevious MS-fitting studies and also enables us to fit in two colour planes,\nV/(B-V) and V/(V-I). With this enlarged subdwarf sample we investigate whether\nthe current discrepancy in empirical distance estimates for 47 Tuc, arising\nfrom recent MS-fitting and white dwarf fitting results, is due to inaccuracies\nin the MS-fitting method. Comparison of published photometries for 47 Tuc has\nrevealed systematic offsets which mean that the $(B-V)$ main-line used in\nprevious studies may be too blue by ~ 0.02 mag. We have derived main-lines in\nV/(B-V) and V/(V-I) from the data of Kaluzny et al. (1998), which we have\nrecalibrated from the `secondary' standards in 47 Tuc of Stetson (2000). Using\nan assumed cluster reddening of E(B-V)=0.04, our best-fit apparent distance\nmodulus is (m-M)V=13.37 (+0.10)(-0.11) in both colour planes, which implies a\ncluster age of 11.0 +/-1.4 Gyr and leads to a dereddened distance modulus of\n(m-M)0=13.25 (+0.06)(-0.07). Comparison with previous work shows that our\napparent distance modulus is ~0.2 mag smaller than those derived in previous\nMS-fitting studies. The difference is accounted for by our preferred cluster\nreddening and the recalibration of the cluster photometry, which has made the\nmain-line redder by an average of 0.02 mag in (B-V). Independent support for\nour MS-fitting distance comes from consideration of the Red Clump in the\ncluster, from which we derive a dereddened distance modulus of (m-M)0=13.31\n+/-0.05, which is in agreement with the MS-fitting result.

However, for most AGNs\nit is difficult to measure the central velocity dispersions of their host\ngalaxies directly. In this paper we adopt the fundamental plane for ellipticals\nto estimate the central velocity dispersion and SMBH mass for a number of AGNs\nwith morphology parameters of their elliptical host galaxies obtained by the\nHST imaging observations. The estimated SMBH masses of 63 BL Lac objects, 10\nradio galaxies, 10 radio-loud quasars and 9 radio-quiet quasars are mostly in\nthe range of $10^{7.5} M_\\odot$ to $10^{9} M_\\odot$. No significant difference\nin black hole mass is found for high-frequency peaked BL Lacs and low-frequency\npeaked BL Lacs, as well as for radio galaxies and radio-loud quasars. The\nEddington ratios of radio galaxies are substantially smaller than those of\nquasars. This suggests that the different observational features of radio-loud\nAGNs may be mainly dominated by accretion rate rather than by the black hole\nmass, which is in agreement with some evolutionary scenarios recently proposed\nfor radio-loud AGNs. Different from some previous claims, we found that the\nderived mean SMBH mass for radio-loud quasars is only slightly larger than that\nof radio-quiet quasars. Though their SMBH mass distributions are statistically\ndifferent, their Eddington ratio distributions are probably from the same\npopulation. In addition, we noted that the relation between black hole mass and\nhost galaxy luminosity obtained using the fundamental plane provides further\narguments for a nonlinear scaling law between SMBH and galactic bulge mass.",

    "summary": "The physical world is marked by the phenomenon of spontaneous broken symmetry\n(SBS) i.e. where the state of a system is assymmetric with respect to the\nsymmetry principles that govern its dynamics. For material systems this is not\nsurprising since more often than not energetic considerations dictate that the\nground state or low lying excited states of many body system become ordered\ni.e. a collective variable, such as magnetization or the Fourier transform of\nthe density of a solid, picks up expectation values which otherwise would\nvanish by virtue of the dynamical symmetry(isotropy or translational symmetry\nin the aforementioned examples). More surprising was the discovery of the role\nof SBS in describing the vacuum or low lyng excitations of a quantum field\ntheory. First came spontaneously broken chiral symmetry which was then applied\nto soft pion physics. When combined with current algebra, this field dominated\nparticle physics in the 60's. Then came the application of the notion of SBS to\nsituations where the symmetry is locally implemented by gauge fields. In that\ncase the concept of order becomes more subtle. This development lead the way to\nelectroweak unification and it remains one of the principal tools of the\ntheorist in the quest for physics beyond the standard model. This brief review\nis intended to span the history of SBS with emphasis on conceptual rather than\nquantitative content. It is a written version of lectures of R.Brout on the\n``Paleolithic Age'' and on ``Modern Times'' by F.Englert, i.e. respectively\nwithout and with gauge fields.",

    "summary": "It is theoretically possible to combine several Hall bars in arrays to define\nnew quantum standards with perfectly quantized resistance values. We have thus,\nfor the first time, developed and fabricated novel Quantum Hall Array\nResistance Standards (QHARS) made of a large number N (N=100, 50) of Hall bars\nplaced in parallel using a triple connections technique. The Hall resistance of\nthese quantum standards is found to be very well quantized. On the i=2 Hall\nplateau, the resistance of specific good arrays stays equal to RK/2N within 5\nparts in 10^9 for supplying currents up to 2 mA at a 1.3 K temperature. The\nmean longitudinal resistance of the Hall bars which constitute the arrays has\nbeen determined through the analysis of the array equivalent electrical\ncircuit. This measurement shows that the carrier transport in the Hall bars is\ndissipation-less. This work therefore demonstrates the efficiency of the\nmultiple connections technique and consequently that QHARS are likely to extend\nthe QHE metrological applications.",

The logical structure of the extraction process has a natural\ngeometry and hierarchy of communication needs; a computer whose physical\narchitecture is designed to reflect this will be able to tolerate the most\nnoise.

Narrow band\nimages reveal different morphologies for each component. The kT=0.65keV\ncomponent, which dominates the emission measure (4.5E65m^{-3}), is in\nionisation equilibrium. This provides a lower limit of 3000 yrs to the age of\nthe remnant, which is considerably older than the previously assumed age of the\nremnant (1500 yrs). Based on the measured energy of the Fe-K feature at 6.5\nkeV, the hot (3.5 keV) component is found to be recently shocked (~200 yrs) and\nstill ionising.

Our computer experiments use chains up to 320 beads and\ncover a large range of wave vectors and a time range exceeding the reptation\ntime. -- We compare our results (i) to the predictions of the primitive chain\nmodel, (ii) to an approximate form resulting from Rouse motion in a coiled\ntube, and (iii) to our recent evaluation of the full reptation model. (i) The\nprimitive chain model can fit the data for times t \\gt 20 T_2, where T_2 is the\nRouse time of the chain. Besides some phenomenological amplitude factor this\nfit involves the reptation time T_3 as a second fit parameter. For the chain\nlengths measured, the asymptotic behavior T_3 ~ N^3 is not attained. (ii) The\nmodel of Rouse motion in a tube, which we have criticized before on theoretical\ngrounds, is shown to fail also on the purely phenomenological level. (iii) Our\nevaluation of the full reptation model yields an excellent fit to the data for\nboth total chains and internal pieces and for all wave vectors and all times,\nprovided specific micro-structure effects of the MC-dynamics are negligible.\nSuch micro-structure effects show up for wave vectors of the order of the\ninverse segment size. For the dynamics of the total chain our data analysis\nbased on the full reptation model shows the importance of tube length\nfluctuations. Universal (Rouse-type) internal relaxation is unimportant. It can\nbe observed only in the form of the diffusive motion of a short central\nsubchain in the tube. -- Finally we present a fit formula which in a large\nrange of wave vectors and chain lengths reproduces the numerical results of our\ntheory for the scattering from the total chain.",

Above a critical packing fraction, moving ordered\ndomains of nearly vertical rods spontaneously form and coexist with horizontal\nrods. The domains of vertical rods coarsen in time to form large vortices. We\ninvestigate the conditions under which the vortices occur by varying the number\nof rods, vibration amplitude and frequency. The size of the vortices increases\nwith the number of rods. We characterize the growth of the ordered domains by\nmeasuring the area fraction of the ordered regions as a function of time. A\n{\\em void filling} model is presented to describe the nucleation and growth of\nthe vertical domains. We track the ends of the vertical rods and obtain the\nvelocity fields of the vortices. The rotation speed of the rods is observed to\ndepend on the vibration velocity of the container and on the packing. To\ninvestigate the impact of the direction of driving on the observed phenomena,\nwe performed experiments with the container vibrated horizontally. Although\nvertical domains form, vortices are not observed. We therefore argue that the\nmotion is generated due to the interaction of the inclination of the rods with\nthe bottom of a vertically vibrated container. We also perform simple\nexperiments with a single row of rods in an annulus. These experiments directly\ndemonstrate that the rod motion is generated when the rods are inclined from\nthe vertical, and is always in the direction of the inclination.",

The\namplitude and angular shape of the cross-correlation function w_QG contain\ninformation on cosmological parameters and the galaxy bias factor. While the\nexistence of this cross-correlation has firmly been established, existing data\ndid not allow an accurate measurement of w_QG yet, but wide area surveys like\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey now provide an ideal database for measuring it.\nHowever, w_QG depends on several cosmological parameters and the galaxy bias\nfactor. We study in detail the sensitivity of w_QG to these parameters and\ndevelop a strategy for using the data. We show that the parameter space can be\nreduced to the bias factor b, Omega_0 and sigma_8, and compute the accuracy\nwith which these parameters can be deduced from SDSS data. Under reasonable\nassumptions, it should be possible to reach relative accuracies of the order of\n5%-15% for b, Omega_0, and sigma_8.

Our model also accounts for the Poisson nature of\nbackground contamination of the observations, image blurring due to instrument\nresponse, and the absorption of photons in space. The resulting highly\nstructured hierarchical model is fit using the Gibbs sampler, data augmentation\nand Metropolis-Hasting. We demonstrate our methods with the X-ray spectral\nanalysis of several \"Metal Abundance Deficient\" stars. The model is designed to\nsummarize the relative frequency of the energy of photons (X-ray or gamma-ray)\narriving at a detector. Independent Poisson distributions are more appropriate\nto model the counts than the commonly used normal approximation. We model the\nhigh energy tail of the ASCA spectrum of each of the stars as a combination of\na Bremsstrahlung continuum and ten narrow emission lines, included at positions\nof known strong lines. Statistical analysis is based on two source observations\nand one background observation. We use sequential Bayesian analysis for the two\nsource observations; the posterior distribution from the first analysis is used\nto construct a prior for the second. Sensitivity of the final results to the\nchoise of prior is investigated by altering the prior.",

We show that all of these issues can be addressed by the recent\napplication of the Kreimer Hopf algebra for quantum field theory\nrenormalization to non-perturbative statistical physics. The main difference\nfrom standard renormalization group is that the Hopf algebra executes block\ntransformations in parts of the lattice only but in a controlled manner so that\nthe end result is a fully block-transformed lattice.",

In\nthe present paper, we consider a crack running parallel to the layers. We\npropose a new term added to the previous elastic energy, which is associated\nwith the bending of layers. We show that there are two regimes for the\nparallel-fracture solution of this elastic energy; near the fracture tip the\ndeformation field is governed by a parabolic differential equation while the\nfield away from the tip follows the usual elliptic equation. Analytical results\nshow that the fracture tip is lenticular, as suggested in a paper on a smectic\nliquid crystal (P. G. de Gennes, Europhys. Lett. 13 (8), 709 (1990)). On the\ncontrary, away from the tip, the stress and deformation distribution recover\nthe usual singular behaviors (sqrt(x) and 1/sqrt(x), respectively, where x is\nthe distance from the tip).

These grid numbers enable us to put the outer boundaries\nof the computational domain near the local wave zone and hence to calculate\ngravitational waveforms of good accuracy (within $\\sim 10%$ error) for the\nfirst time. To model neutron stars, we adopt a $\\Gamma$-law equation of state\nin the form $P=(\\Gamma-1)\\rho\\epsilon$, where P, $\\rho$, $\\varep$ and $\\Gamma$\nare the pressure, rest mass density, specific internal energy, and adiabatic\nconstant. It is found that gravitational waves in the merger stage have\ncharacteristic features that reflect the formed objects. In the case that a\nmassive, transient neutron star is formed, its quasi-periodic oscillations are\nexcited for a long duration, and this property is reflected clearly by the\nquasi-periodic nature of waveforms and the energy luminosity. In the case of\nblack hole formation, the waveform and energy luminosity are likely damped\nafter a short merger stage. However, a quasi-periodic oscillation can still be\nseen for a certain duration, because an oscillating transient massive object is\nformed during the merger. This duration depends strongly on the initial\ncompactness of neutron stars and is reflected in the Fourier spectrum of\ngravitational waves.

We derive the average X-ray spectral properties of sources in\ndifferent luminosity ranges, and we correlate the X-ray positions with radio,\nIR, and optical HST data. The X-ray sources are predominantly associated with\nyoung stellar clusters, indicating that they belong to the young stellar\npopulation.

While their spectrum is consistent with those of ULXs\nstudied in nearby galaxies, and interpreted as the counterparts of intermediate\nmass black-holes (M >10-1000 \\msun), comparison with the position of\nstar-clusters suggests that some of the ULXs may be runaway binaries, thus\nsuggesting lower-mass binary systems. The co-added spectrum of the sources in\nthe 3x10^{38}-10^{39} erg\\s luminosity range is consistent with those of\nGalactic black-hole candidates. These sources are also on average displaced\nfrom neighboring star clusters. The softer spectrum of the less luminous\nsources suggests the presence of SNRs or of hot interstellar medium (ISM) in\nthe Chandra source extraction area.

The cumulative XLF is well represented by a flat power law\n($\\alpha=-0.47$), similar to those describing the XLFs of other star-forming\nsystems (e.g. M82, the disk of M81), but different from those of early type\ngalaxies. This result associates the X-ray source population in the Antennae\nwith young High Mass X-ray Binaries. In comparison with less actively\nstar-forming galaxies, the XLF of the Antennae has a highly significant excess\nof sources with luminosities above 10^{39} erg\\s (Ultra Luminous Sources;\nULXs). We discuss the nature of these sources, based on the XLF and on their\ngeneral spectral properties, as well as their optical counterparts discussed in\nPaper III. We conclude that the majority of the ULXs cannot be intermediate\nmass black-holes (M > 10-1000 \\msun) binaries, unless they are linked to the\nremnants of massive Population III stars (the Madau & Rees model). Instead,\ntheir spatial and multiwavelength properties can be well explained by beamed\nemission as a consequence of supercritical accretion.\n  Binaries with a neutron star or moderate mass black-hole (up to 20\\msun), and\nB2 to A type star companions would be consistent with our data. In the beaming\nscenario, the XLF should exibit caracteristic breaks that will be visible in\nfuture deeper observations of the Antennae.",

We also allow for an outer\nenvelope composed of ordinary fluid. We derive and implement the junction\nconditions for the metric and matter variables at the core/envelope interface.\nWe investigate how the quasinormal modes of a superfluid star are affected by\nchanges in the entrainment parameter, and unveil a series of avoided crossings\nbetween the various modes. We provide a proof that all modes of a two-fluid\nstar must radiate gravitationally. We also discuss the future detectability of\npulsations in a superfluid star and argue that it may be possible to use\ngravitational-wave data to constrain the parameters of superfluid neutron\nstars.",

Evidence hence emerges indicating that Triplets and Multiplets,\nthough sharing a common scale, correspond to different galaxy systems. Triplets\nare typically field structures whilst Multiplets are mainly subclumps (either\ntemporarily projected or collapsing) within larger structures.

We find that a high neutron\nexposure and a small overlap factor are necessary to fit the abundance pattern\nobserved in these two metal-deficient stars, particularly the abundance ratios,\nPb/Ba $\\approx 1$ and Ba/Sr $\\approx 10$. We have also constructed stellar\nmodels to better understand how such s-process conditions could arise. We have\ncalculated a 2$M_\\odot$ model star with metallicity [Fe/H]=-2.7 from the ZAMS\nup to AGB phase. We find that for such low-metallicity stars the He convective\nshell reaches the bottom of the overlying H-rich envelope at the second thermal\npulse. Protons are then carried into the hotter He burning layers and $^{13}$C\nis formed as protons mix into the He shell. Subsequently, material in the\nH-flash driven convective zone experiences a high neutron exposure due to the\n$^{13}$C($\\alpha$, n) reaction. This results in a new neutron-capture s-process\nparadigm in which the abundances are characterized by only one neutron\nexposure. We suggest that this new s-process site may be a significant\ncontributor to the s-process abundances in low-metallicity ([Fe/H] $\\le -2.5$)\nstars.",

    "summary": "A general purpose, self-adapting, Monte Carlo (MC) event generator\n(simulator) is described. The high efficiency of the MC, that is small maximum\nweight or variance of the MC weight is achieved by means of dividing the\nintegration domain into small cells. The cells can be $n$-dimensional\nsimplices, hyperrectangles or Cartesian product of them. The grid of cells,\ncalled ``foam'', is produced in the process of the binary split of the cells.\nThe choice of the next cell to be divided and the position/direction of the\ndivision hyper-plane is driven by the algorithm which optimizes the ratio of\nthe maximum weight to the average weight or (optionally) the total variance.\nThe algorithm is able to deal, in principle, with an arbitrary pattern of the\nsingularities in the distribution. As any MC generator, it can also be used for\nthe MC integration. With the typical personal computer CPU, the program is able\nto perform adaptive integration/simulation at relatively small number of\ndimensions ($\\leq 16$). With the continuing progress in the CPU power, this\nlimit will get inevitably shifted to ever higher dimensions. {\\tt Foam} is\naimed (and already tested) as a component in the MC event generators for the\nhigh energy physics experiments. A few simple examples of the related\napplications are presented. {\\tt Foam} is written in fully object-oriented\nstyle, in the C++ language. Two other versions with a slightly limited\nfunctionality, are available in the Fortran77 language. The source codes are\navailable from http://jadach.home.cern.ch/jadach/",

Thus, if high redshift sub-mm sources\nrepresent massive spheroids in formation, there must be a time lag between the\nmajor epoch of star-formation and the appearance of a visible quasar. Despite\nthis distinction, I find tentative evidence for a puzzling angular\ncross-correlation between X-ray sources and bright sub-mm sources in two\nindependent fields. If this signal is due to large-scale structure it would\nargue for a low redshift (z<2) for many of the SCUBA sources. Alternatively, I\nsuggest that the effect may be enhanced by gravitational lensing. The\nexceptionally steep slope of the bright sub-mm counts makes this population\nparticularly prone to lensing bias. An apparent correlation may therefore be\nproduced if X-ray sources trace the intervening large scale structure.",

This question can be addressed from a number of\ndifferent directions, one of which is to compare the masses of sub-mm host\ngalaxies with those of other known massive high-redshift objects.

It is\nshown that for every \\Delta^0_2-computable real number \\alpha in [0,1] there is\na \\Delta^0_2 sequence S such that \\dim(S) = \\alpha.\n  A discrete version of constructive dimension is also developed using\ntermgales, which are supergale-like functions that bet on the terminations of\n(finite, binary) strings as well as on their successive bits. This discrete\ndimension is used to assign each individual string w a dimension, which is a\nnonnegative real number dim(w). The dimension of a sequence is shown to be the\nlimit infimum of the dimensions of its prefixes.\n  The Kolmogorov complexity of a string is proven to be the product of its\nlength and its dimension. This gives a new characterization of algorithmic\ninformation and a new proof of Mayordomo's recent theorem stating that the\ndimension of a sequence is the limit infimum of the average Kolmogorov\ncomplexity of its first n bits.\n  Every sequence that is random relative to any computable sequence of\ncoin-toss biases that converge to a real number \\beta in (0,1) is shown to have\ndimension \\H(\\beta), the binary entropy of \\beta.",

    "summary": "Recent X-ray observations have been used to demonstrate that the cluster gas\nmass-temperature relation is steeper than theoretical self-similar predictions\ndrawn from numerical simulations that consider the evolution of the cluster gas\nthrough the effects of gravity and shock heating alone. One possible\nexplanation for this is that the gas mass fraction is not constant across\nclusters of different temperature, as is usually assumed. Observationally,\nhowever, there is no compelling evidence for gas mass fraction variation,\nespecially in the case of hot clusters. Seeking an alternative physical\nexplanation for the observed trends, we investigate the role in the cluster gas\nmass - temperature relation of the preheating of the intracluster medium by\nsome arbitrary source for clusters with emission-weighted mean temperatures of\ngreater than about 3 keV. Making use of the physically-motivated, analytic\nmodels developed in 2002 by Babul and coworkers, we find that preheating does,\nindeed, lead to a steeper relation. This is in agreement with previous\ntheoretical studies on the relation. However, in apparent conflict with these\nstudies, we argue that a ``high'' level of entropy injection is required to\nmatch observations. In particular, an entropy floor of greater than about 300\nkeV cm^2 is required. We also present a new test, namely, the study of the\nrelation within different fixed radii. This allows one to indirectly probe the\ndensity profiles of clusters, since it samples different fractions of the\nvirial radius for clusters of different temperature. This test also confirms\nthat a high level of preheating is required to match observations.",

From the observed\nrapid decline of the luminosity, over a timescale of a few years, we argue that\nthe flare was powered by the fallback of debris rather than subsequent\naccretion via a thin disk. The fallback model allows constraints to be set on\nthe black hole mass and the mass of debris. The latter must be very much less\nthan a solar mass to explain the very low luminosity of the flare. The\nobservations can be explained either as the partial stripping of the outer\nlayers of a low-mass main sequence star or as the disruption of a brown dwarf\nor a giant planet. We find that the X-ray emission in the flare must have\noriginated within a small patch rather than over the entire torus of\ncircularized material surrounding the black hole. We suggest that the patch\ncorresponds to the ``bright spot'' where the stream of returning debris impacts\nthe torus. Interestingly, although the peak luminosity of the flare was highly\nsub-Eddington, the peak flux from the bright spot was close to the Eddington\nlimit. We speculate on the implications of this result for observations of\nother flare events.",

The observations\nwere done with two filters LW2 (5-8.5 microns) and LW3 (12-18 microns) that\nmeasure respectively the aromatic carbon bands and the underlying continuum\nemission from small dust particles. Three 0.05 square degree images sample\natomic and molecular sections in the Ursa Major cirrus. These images are\ncompared with Hi, CO and IRAS observations. In such a cloud transparent to\nstellar light (Av < 0.5) the mid-infrared to 100 microns and the mid-IR\nemissivity per hydrogen are related to the abundance and the optical properties\nof small dust particles independently of any modelling of the penetration of\nthe radiation. Within the atomic section of the cloud, the comparison between\nISOCAM images and 21 cm interferometric data highlights an enhancement of the\nmid-IR emitters abundance by a factor ~5 in an Hi filament characterized by a\nlarge transverse velocity gradient suggestive of rotation. Furthermore, a drop\nin the abundance of the same mid-IR emitters is observed at the interface\nbetween the atomic and molecular cirrus sections. We propose that these\nabundance variations of the mid-IR emitters are related to the production of\nsmall dust particles by grain shattering in energetic grain-grain collisions\ngenerated by turbulent motions within the cirrus and inversely by their\ndisappearance due to coagulation on large grains. At the atomic-molecular\ninterface we also observe a decrease of the Lw2/Lw3 ratio by a factor 2 in the\nmolecular region. This could result from a modification of the dust size\ndistribution or of the intrinsic optical properties of the small dust\nparticles.",

    "summary": "I present the results of a search for intergalactic hydrogen clouds in voids.\nClouds are detected by their HI LyA absorption lines in the HST spectra of\nlow-redshift AGN. The parameter with which the environments of clouds are\ncharacterized is the tidal field, which places a lower limit on the cloud\nmass-density which is dynamically stable against disruption. Galaxy redshift\ncatalogs are used to sum the tidal fields along the lines of sight, sorting\nclouds according to tidal field upper, or lower limits. The analytical\nmethodology employed is designed to detect gas clouds whose expansion following\nreionization is restrained by dark matter perturbations. End-products are the\ncloud equivalent width distribution functions (EWDF) of catalogs formed by\nsorting clouds according to various tidal field upper, or lower limits.\n  Cumulative EWDFs are steep in voids (S ~ -1.5 \\pm 0.2), but flatter in high\ntidal field zones (S ~ -0.5 \\pm 0.1). Most probable cloud Doppler parameters\nare ~30 km/s in voids and ~60 km/s in proximity to galaxies. In voids, the\ncumulative line density at low EW (~ 15 mA) is ~ 500 per unit redshift. The\nvoid filling factor is found to be 0.87 <= f_v <= 0.94. The void EWDF is\nremarkably uniform over this volume, with a possible tendency for more massive\nclouds to be in void centers. The size and nature of the void cloud population\nsuggested by this study is completely unanticipated by the results of published\n3-D simulations, which predict that most clouds are in filamentary structures\naround galaxy concentrations, and that very few observable absorbers would lie\nin voids. Strategies for modeling this population are briefly discussed.",

The nuclear effects due to modification\nof the bound nucleon structure, soft nucleon-nucleon reinteraction in the\ninitial and final states of the reaction with and without color coherence have\nbeen considered. The calculations including these nuclear effects show that the\ndistribution of the bound proton light-cone momentum fraction $(\\alpha)$ shifts\ntowards small values ($\\alpha < 1$), effect which was previously derived only\nwithin plane wave impulse approximation. This shift is very sensitive to the\nstrength of the short range correlations in nuclei. Also calculated is an\nexcess of the total longitudinal momentum of outgoing protons. The calculations\nare compared with data on the $C(p,2p)X$ reaction obtained from the EVA/AGS\nexperiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory. These data show $\\alpha$-shift in\nagreement with the calculations. The comparison allows also to single out the\ncontribution from short-range nucleon correlations.

The valence electrons are described by a model\nwith the weak bond-energy dimerization, while the relaxation processes are\ntaken into account phenomenologically. It turns out that the interband\nconductivity of the insulating half-filled case fits well the single-particle\noptical conductivity measured in various CDW systems. In the metallic regime,\nfor the doubled Fermi vector 2k_F close to \\pi/a, the conduction electrons\nexhibit a non-Drude low-frequency response, with the total spectral weight\nshared between the intraband and interband channels nearly in equal\nproportions.

The information about the first pulse duration is imprinted into the\npopulation difference of the inhomogeneously broadened ensemble of the\ntwo-level absorbers. The decay of the SNE signal has two contributions. One\noriginates from the population decay during the time tau between the pulses.\nAnother is caused by the coherence loss during the excitation by the first\npulse and the reading time of the second pulse. Experimental results on the\ndecay properties induced by these mechanisms are presented.

The\ndust emission around this source shows a very extended envelope, which accounts\nfor most of the circumstellar mass of 5.1 Msun. This source is powering a\nstrong molecular outflow, elongated in the E--W direction, which presents a\ncomplex structure and kinematics. While at high outflow velocities the outflow\nis clearly bipolar, at low outflow velocities the blueshifted and redshifted\nemission are highly overlapping, and the strongest emission shows a V-shaped\nmorphology. The outflow as traced by CS and CH3OH exhibits two well\ndifferentiated and clumpy lobes, with two prominent northern blueshifted and\nredshifted clumps. The curved shape of the clumps and the spectral shape at\nthese positions are consistent with shocked material.

There is clear evidence for a thin shell of 50 arcsec radius.\nThis is identified with the weaker circumstellar absorption component known as\nS2.

    "summary": "The state of a two-particle system is called entangled when its quantum\nmechanical wave function cannot be factorized in two single-particle wave\nfunctions. Entanglement leads to the strongest counter-intuitive feature of\nquantum mechanics, namely nonlocality. Experimental realization of quantum\nentanglement is relatively easy for the case of photons; a pump photon can\nspontaneously split into a pair of entangled photons inside a nonlinear\ncrystal. In this paper we combine quantum entanglement with nanostructured\nmetal optics in the form of optically thick metal films perforated with a\nperiodic array of subwavelength holes. These arrays act as photonic crystals\nthat may convert entangled photons into surface-plasmon waves, i.e.,\ncompressive charge density waves. We address the question whether the\nentanglement survives such a conversion. We find that, in principle, optical\nexcitation of the surface plasmon modes of a metal is a coherent process at the\nsingle-particle level. However, the quality of the plasmon-assisted\nentanglement is limited by spatial dispersion of the hole arrays. This spatial\ndispersion is due to the nonlocal dielectric response of a metal, which is\nparticularly large in the plasmonic regime; it introduces \"which way\" labels,\nthat may kill entanglement.",

In 1997\nSeptember we observed the ``turn-on'' of a 35 d cycle with the Rossi X-ray\nTiming Explorer (RXTE).

This interpretation is consistent with\nthe variation of the pulse profile observed at the same time. The overall shape\nof the pulse profile is not changing, but towards earlier phases of the turn-on\nthe pulse signature is steadily ``washed out''. This behavior can be understood\nas an influence of scattering and absorption due to the presence of the\naccretion disk rim. Using a Monte Carlo code we simulate the influence of both\nprocesses on a time variable, beamed emission characteristic, similar to the\npulse profile of Her X-1.

Microlensing is common in multiply imaged sources. We\nfind that 1 in 3 multiply imaged quasars should vary by more than 0.5\nmagnitudes per decade due to microlensing, while 10% of macrolensed GRB\nafterglows should show a departure of more than 0.5 magnitudes from their\nintrinsic light-curve during the first 30 days. However microlensing by stars\nis rare in general, with only 1 source in ~500 varying by more than 0.5\nmagnitudes during the same periods. We find that most microlensing by stars\nwill be observed in a regime where gamma>0.1. Thus point-mass lenses do not\nprovide an adequate description for most microlensing events. If dark matter\nhalos contain a large fraction of mass in compact objects, the fraction of\nmicrolensed (by 0.5 magnitudes) images rises significantly to ~1 in 10 for\nquasars and ~1 in 5 for GRB afterglows. Comparison of variability between\nmacrolensed and normal quasar images, and a moderate number of well sampled GRB\nafterglow light-curves should therefore discover or refute the existence of\nstellar mass compact objects in galaxy halos. While microlensing results in\ndepartures of the distribution of magnifications from that of a smooth model,\nthe effect on the macrolensing magnification bias for the discovery of lenses\nin quasar surveys is small. On the other hand, microlensing significantly\nbroadens the distribution of macrolensed image flux ratios.",

The aim of this mechanism is to diminish sensitivity of the auditory\nprocess to nonlinear distortions by appropriate decoding of sound information.\nThe general rule of construction and the mathematical model of such a mechanism\nis proposed, which allows for the explanation of many problems associated with\ncombination tones.

Based on the\ntheory, we devise the first on-line training algorithms for table compression,\nwhich can be applied to individual files, not just continuously operating\nsources; and also a new, off-line training algorithm, based on a link to the\nasymmetric traveling salesman problem, which improves on prior work by\nrearranging columns prior to partitioning. We demonstrate these results\nexperimentally. On various test files, the on-line algorithms provide 35-55%\nimprovement over gzip with negligible slowdown; the off-line reordering\nprovides up to 20% further improvement over partitioning alone.

The\nabstract real Hilbert subspace version of the Tomita-Takesaki theory enables us\nto bypass some limitations of the Wigner formalism by introducing an intrinsic\nspacetime localization. Our approach works also for continuous spin\nrepresentations to which we associate a net of von Neumann algebras on\nspacelike cones with the Reeh-Schlieder property. The positivity of the energy\nin the representation turns out to be equivalent to the isotony of the net, in\nthe spirit of Borchers theorem. Our procedure extends to other spacetimes\nhomogeneous under a group of geometric transformations as in the case of\nconformal symmetries and de Sitter spacetime.",

A classical analogy for a spin-half particle and other\narguments show that the infinite amount of information needed to specify a\nprecise vector in its Hilbert space is not a measure of the information carried\nby a quantum entity with a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space; the latter is,\ninstead, bounded by log d bits (1 bit per qubit). The two bits of information\ntransmitted in dense coding are located not in one but in the correlation\nbetween two qubits, consistent with this bound. A quantum channel can be\nthought of as a \"structure\" or collection of frameworks, and the physical\nlocation of the information in the individual frameworks can be used to\nidentify the location of the channel. Analysis of a quantum circuit used as a\nmodel of teleportation shows that the location of the channel depends upon\nwhich structure is employed; for ordinary teleportation it is not (contrary to\nDeutsch and Hayden) present in the two bits resulting from the Bell-basis\nmeasurement, but in correlations of these with a distant qubit. In neither\nteleportation nor dense coding does information travel backwards in time, nor\nis it transmitted by nonlocal (superluminal) influences.

The relation of this model to experiment is\nalso provided. Finally, the master equation for the finite channel-number\nmembrane is analysed numerically with the help of an exact-diagonalization\ntechnique. In particular, the decay-time of a metastable solution is estimated.\nThe results do not agree with those obtained perturbationally, the difference\nis explained by the proposed frozen-diffusion approach.",

Bars inside bars\nare surprisingly common: at least one quarter of the sample galaxies (possibly\nas many as 40%) are double-barred, with no preference for Hubble type or the\nstrength of the primary bar. A typical secondary bar is ~12% of the size of its\nprimary bar and 240--750 pc in radius. We see no significant effect of\nsecondary bars on nuclear activity. We also find kiloparsec-scale inner disks\nin at least 20% of our sample, almost exclusively in S0 galaxies. These disks\nare on average 20% the size of their host bar, and show a wider range of\nrelative sizes than do secondary bars. Nuclear rings are present in about a\nthird of our sample. Most are dusty, sites of current or recent star formation,\nor both; such rings are preferentially found in Sa galaxies. Three S0 galaxies\n(15% of the S0's) appear to have purely stellar nuclear rings, with no evidence\nfor dust or recent star formation. The fact that these central stellar\nstructures are so common indicates that the inner regions of early-type barred\ngalaxies typically contain dynamically cool and disklike structures. This is\nespecially true for S0 galaxies, where secondary bars, inner disks, and/or\nstellar nuclear rings are present at least two thirds of the time. (abridged)",

The effective temperatures derived from\nspectroscopy were compared with temperatures estimated using optical and\nnear-infrared photometry. In many cases the spectroscopic temperatures are\nsignificantly higher than the photometric estimates, possibly as a result of\nspottedness or chromospheric activity on these active stars.

The correlation between heavy element abundance patterns\nand kinematics (space motion) was also examined. Two nearby stars that were\ntentatively assigned to the Hyades cluster based on kinematics have Fe\nabundances that are also consistent with membership in that cluster. Members of\nthe Ursa Major kinematic group exhibit a range of [Fe/H] values but have\nmonotonic [Si/Fe].

Radial velocity\nmeasurements of the Balmer lines and the HeI6678 line show that this is a\nbinary white dwarf with a period of 30.09d in which the Balmer lines move in\nanti-phase to the HeI line, i.e., PG1115+166 is a DA+DB binary. The minimum\nmasses of the stars are M_DA=0.43+-0.15 solar masses and M_DB=0.52+-0.12 solar\nmasses. The separation of the stars is about 45 solar radii which is much\nsmaller than a typical AGB progenitor of a white dwarf, implying that there has\nbeen at least one common envelope phase in this binary. Indeed, it is possible\nthat this binary may have suffered up to three mass transfer episodes - two\nassociated with the red giant phase prior to the formation of each white dwarf\nand a third associated with the ``born-again'' red giant phase of the DB white\ndwarf. PG1115+166 has the longest orbital period of any post common envelope\nwhite dwarf - white dwarf binary found to date. Published models for the\nformation of white dwarf - white dwarf binaries do not predict any white dwarfs\nwith the combination of long orbital period and high mass found in PG1115+166.\nWe conclude that PG1115+166 is a key object for testing models of binary star\nevolution and it may also be a key object for our understanding of the\nformation of DB white dwarfs. We outline the observational tests which can be\napplied to scenarios for the formation of PG1115+166 and apply them to the\nsimplest case of a single common envelope phase.

We derive exact results which extend to general Spectral Measures\nM_phi the Pflug--Rockafellar--Uryasev methodology for the minimization of\nalpha--Expected Shortfall. The minimization problem of a spectral measure is\nshown to be equivalent to the minimization of a suitable function which\ncontains additional parameters, but displays analytical properties (piecewise\nlinearity and convexity in all arguments, absence of sorting subroutines) which\nallow for efficient minimization procedures.\n  In doing so we also reveal a new picture where the classical risk--reward\nproblem a la Markowitz (minimizing risks with constrained returns or maximizing\nreturns with constrained risks) is shown to coincide to the unconstrained\noptimization of a single suitable spectral measure. In other words, minimizing\na spectral measure turns out to be already an optimization process itself,\nwhere risk minimization and returns maximization cannot be disentangled from\neach other.",

    "summary": "Utilizing a new, high mass resolution hydrodynamic simulation we compute the\nmetallicity evolution of damped Lyman alpha systems (DLAs) and find a\nreasonable agreement with observations. In particular, the observed slow\nevolution of the DLA metallicity occurs naturally in the simulation due to the\ncombined effects of physical and observational selection. The slow metallicity\nevolution is caused by the steady transformation, with increasing time, of the\nhighest metallicity systems to \"galaxies\", thus depleting this category, while\nall the lower metallicity systems show, individually, an increase in\nmetallicity. Although the trend of DLA metallicity with redshift is in good\nagreement with observations, it appears that the average metallicity of\nsimulated DLAs is higher than observed by 0.3-0.5 dex in the probed redshift\nrange (z=0-5). Our study indicates that this difference may be attributed to\nobservational selection effects due to dust obscuration. If we allow for a dust\nobscuration effect, our model reproduces the observed metallicity evolution in\nboth amplitude and slope. We find that DLAs are not a simple population but\nprobe a range of different systems and the mix changes with redshift. About 50%\nof all metals in the gaseous phase is in DLAs at all times from z=5 to z=1,\nmaking a rapid downturn at z\\le 1 to ~20% by z=0, as metals are swept into the\nhotter components of the IGM as well as locked up in stars. While not the\nprimary focus of this study, we find that the model provides good matches to\nobservations with respect to column density distribution and evolution of\nneutral gas content, if the same dust obscuration is taken into account. We\nfind Omega_{DLA,comp}=(1-3)E-3, depending on the effect of dust obscuration.",

Most of the\nmeasurements were made on a high quality crystal of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6.6}$. It\nis shown that this crystal has highly ordered ortho-II chain order, and a sharp\nsuperconducting transition. Inelastic scattering measurements display a very\nclean spin-gap and pseudogap with any intensity at 10 meV being 50 times\nsmaller than the resonance intensity. The crystal shows a complicated magnetic\norder that appears to have three components. A magnetic phase is found at high\ntemperatures that seems to stem from an impurity with a moment that is in the\n$a$-$b$ plane, but disordered on the crystal lattice. A second ordering occurs\nnear the pseudogap temperature that has a shorter correlation length than the\nhigh temperature phase and a moment direction that is at least partly along the\nc-axis of the crystal. Its moment direction, temperature dependence, and Bragg\nintensities suggest that it may stem from orbital ordering of the $d$-density\nwave (DDW) type. An additional intensity increase occurs below the\nsuperconducting transition. The magnetic intensity in these phases does not\nchange noticeably in a 7 Tesla magnetic field aligned approximately along the\nc-axis. Searches for magnetic order in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7}$ show no signal\nwhile a small magnetic intensity is found in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6.45}$ that is\nconsistent with c-axis directed magnetic order.

We show that a\nmodel in which planets form at 5 AU at a constant rate, before migrating, leads\nto a predicted distribution of planets that is a steeply rising function of log\n(a), where a is the orbital radius. Between 1 AU and 3 AU, the expected number\nof planets per logarithmic interval in orbital radius roughly doubles. We\ndemonstrate that, once selection effects are accounted for, this is consistent\nwith current data, and then extrapolate the observed planet fraction to masses\nand radii that are inaccessible to current observations. In total, about 15\npercent of stars targeted by existing radial velocity searches are predicted to\npossess planets with masses 0.3 M_Jupiter < M_p sin (i) < 10 M_Jupiter, and\nradii 0.1 AU < a < 5 AU. A third of these planets (around 5 percent of the\ntarget stars) lie at the radii most amenable to detection via microlensing. A\nfurther 5-10 percent of stars could have planets at radii of 5 AU < a < 8 AU\nthat have migrated outwards. We discuss the probability of forming a system\n(akin to the Solar System) in which significant radial migration of the most\nmassive planet does not occur. About 10-15 percent of systems with a surviving\nmassive planet are estimated to fall into this class. Finally, we note that a\nsmaller fraction of low mass planets than high mass planets is expected to\nsurvive without being consumed by the star. The initial mass function for\nplanets is thus predicted to rise more steeply towards small masses than the\nobserved mass function.",

Since inertial\naccelerations play a fundamental dynamical role in the process, one may expect\nsubstantial modifications by strong gravity in the case of accretion on to a\nblack hole. In this paper, we develop a fully covariant, Lagrangian\ndisplacement vector field formalism with the aim of addressing these issues for\na disk embedded in a stationary geometry with negligible radial flow. This\nconstruction enables a transparent connection between particle dynamics and the\nensuing dispersion relation for MHD wave modes. The MRI--in its incompressible\nvariant-- is found to operate virtually unabated down to the marginally stable\norbit; the putative inner boundary of standard accretion disk theory. To get a\nqualitative feel for the dynamical evolution of the flow below $r_{\\rm ms}$, we\nassume a mildly advective accretion flow such that the angular velocity profile\ndeparts slowly from circular geodesic flow. This exercise suggests that the\nturbulent eddies will occur at spatial scales approaching the radial distance\nwhile tracking the surfaces of null angular velocity gradients. The implied\nfield topology, namely large-scale horizontal field domains, should yield\nstrong mass segregation at the displacement nodes of the non-linear modes when\nradiation stress dominates the local disk structure (an expectation supported\nby quasi-linear arguments and by the non-linear behavior of the MRI in a\nnon-relativistic setting). Under this circumstance, baryon-poor flux in\nhorizontal field domains will be subject to radial buoyancy and to the Parker\ninstability, thereby promoting the growth of poloidal field.",

In this paper, we propose a different\nweb graph model with power law distribution that does not require incremental\ngrowth.

Because\nof the presence of a critical layer, ordinary weakly non-linear methods fail;\nin this paper, we use a rescaling at the critical layer and matched asymptotics\nto derive an amplitude equation for the most unstable wave, under the\nsimplifying assumption that the physical domain is periodic. These amplitude\nequations are solved numerically, in their quasi-steady limit, for the cases of\nsmall density ratio (applicable to oceanography), and for arbitrary density\nratio but strong stratification (for more general physical/astrophysical\nsituations). In addition to the familiar asymptotic growth found in other\ninviscid flow, we find that, for the air over water case (provided the maximum\nwind velocity is in the range of $0.2\\mpers \\sim 1\\mpers$), the single mode\ntransitions from exponential to algebraic growth when the amplitude of the wave\nis as small as $h\\sim 10^{-5}\\lambda$; hence, it may be difficult to observe\nthe linear regime for this case in numerical simulations.

    "summary": "We have investigated the linear polarisation of Lya transferred in a static,\ndustless, and thick plane-parallel slab that is uniformly filled with neutral\nhydrogen. Because the scattering phase function is characterised by the dipole\ntype for wing scatterings of Lya, which is in high contrast with more isotropic\nscattering phase function associated with resonant scatterings, the\npolarisation of the emergent Lya is dominantly controlled by the number of wing\nscatterings before escape from the slab. When the scattering medium is\nextremely thick, photons emergent in the grazing direction are polarised in the\ndirection perpendicular to the slab normal up to 12%, which coincides with the\nlimit attained by the Thomson scattered radiation in a semi-infinite thick\nmedium investigated by Chandrasekhar in 1960. The number of wing scatterings\nbefore escape is sensitively dependent on the product of the Voigt parameter\n$a$ and the line-centre optical depth $\\tau_0$, with which the variation of the\ndegree of polarisation can also be explained in comparison with the Thomson\nscattering case. The polarisation direction is parallel to the slab normal when\n$a\\tau_0<10^3$, while it is perpendicular when $a\\tau_0>10^3$. Our simulated\nspectropolarimetry of Lya from a highly thick medium is characterised by\nnegligible polarisation around the line centre, parallel polarisation in the\nnear wing parts and perpendicular polarisation in the far wing parts, where the\npolarisation direction is measured with respect to the slab normal. The\npolarisation flip naturally reflects the diffusive nature of the Lya transfer\nprocess in both real space and frequency space. We also discuss the beaming\neffect that is associated with the parallel polarisation in the near wing parts\nof the emission.",

The latter is, of course, valid under all\nmeasurement situations upon classical and quantum objects.

In this article I sketch the beginnings of a\ntheory that would import these notions into the category of hedral sets in the\nsense of Morelli and the category of polyhedral sets in the sense of Schanuel.\nBoth of these theories can be viewed as extensions of the theory of finite sets\nand mappings between finite sets, with the concept of cardinality being\nreplaced by the more general notion of Euler measure (sometimes called\ncombinatorial Euler characteristic). I prove a ``functoriality'' theorem\n(Theorem 1) for subset-selection in the context of polyhedral sets, which\nprovides quasi-combinatorial interpretations of assertions such as $2^{-1} =\n\\frac12$ and ${1/2 \\choose 2} = -\\frac18$.

We consider the effects of Coulomb\ninteractions and quantum interference at this diffusive fixed point. Coulomb\ninteractions enhance the conductivity, in contrast to the situation for\nfermions, essentially because the exchange interaction is opposite in sign. The\ninteraction-driven enhancement of the conductivity is larger than the\nweak-localization suppression, so the system scales to a perfect conductor.\nThus, it is a consistent possibility for the critical resistivity at the\nsuperconductor-insulator transition to be zero, but this value is only\napproached logarithmically.

We analyzed data of\n53 observations of 21 LINERs and 17 low-luminosity Seyferts. X-ray emission has\nbeen detected in all but one object. The X-ray luminosities in the 2-10 keV\nband range from 4e39 ergs/s to 5e41 ergs/s, which are 1-3 orders of magnitude\nsmaller than in classical Seyfert galaxies. The X-ray spectra of most objects\nare well described by a canonical model which consists of (1) a soft component\nfrom a thermal plasma with kT<1 keV and (2) a hard component represented by a\npower law with a photon index~1.8 or thermal bremsstrahlung emission with kT~10\nkeV. Several objects do not require the soft thermal component, and their\ncontinua are well fitted by a single power-law model. Some objects show heavy\nabsorption with column densities in excess of 1e23 cm^-2. We detect in several\nobjects Fe K line emission with equivalent widths ranging from 50 eV to 2 keV.\nVariability on timescales less than a day is uncommon in our sample. By\ncomparing multiple observations made with ASCA or with published observations\nfrom other satellites, we show that at least eight objects are variable on\ntimescales of a week to several years.

We find that halos modeled following the Navarro, Frenk\n& White (NFW) mass profile lose mass continuously due to tides from the massive\nhost, leading to the total disruption of satellite halos with small tidal\nradii. The structure of stripped NFW halos depends mainly on the fraction of\nmass lost, and can be expressed in terms of a simple correction to the original\nNFW profile. We apply these results to substructure in the Milky Way, and\nconclude that the dark matter halos surrounding its dwarf spheroidal (dSph)\nsatellites have circular velocity curves that peak well beyond the luminous\nradius at velocities significantly higher than expected from the stellar\nvelocity dispersion. Our modeling suggests that the true tidal radii of dSphs\nlie well beyond the putative tidal cutoff observed in the surface brightness\nprofile, suggesting that the latter are not really tidal in origin but rather\nfeatures in the light profile of limited dynamical relevance. For Draco, in\nparticular, our modeling implies that its tidal radius is much larger than\nderived by Irwin & Hatzidimitriou (1995), lending support to the interpretation\nof recent Sloan survey data by Odenkirchen et al. (2001). Similarly, our model\nsuggests that Carina's halo has a peak circular velocity of ~55 km/s, which may\nhelp explain how this small galaxy has managed to retain enough gas to undergo\nseveral bursts of star formation. Our results imply a close correspondence\nbetween the most massive subhalos expected in a CDM universe and the known\nsatellites of the Milky Way, and suggest that only subhalos with peak circular\nvelocities below 35 km/s lack readily detectable luminous counterparts.",

In recent\nyears environment-induced decoherence based the quantum Brownian motion (QBM)\nmodels have been applied to two level systems (2LS) interacting with an\nelectromagnetic field, leading to the general belief that 2LS are easily\ndecohered. In a recent paper C. Anastopoulos and B. L. Hu [Phys. Rev.

For\na two-level atom (2LA)- electromagnetic field (EMF) system the decoherence time\nis rather long, comparable to the relaxation time. Theoretically this is\nbecause the dominant interaction is the $\\hat \\sigma_{\\pm}$ type of coupling\nbetween the two levels (what constitutes the qubit) and the field, not the\n$\\hat \\sigma_z$ type, which shows the QBM behavior. Depending on the coupling\nthe field can act as a resonator (in an atom cavity) or as a bath (in QBM) and\nproduce very different decoherent behavior in the system.

We also made an\nupdate for the constraints on the angle $\\gamma$ from the observables $R$ and\n$A_0$. In the parametrization, the SU(2) isospin symmetry of strong\ninteractions has been applied. We found the following results: (a) the measured\nvalue of $R$ is now very close to unit, the bound on the angle $\\gamma$ from\nthe measurement of $R$ is therefore not as promising as before, but some bounds\non $\\gamma$ can still be read off from $r-\\gamma$ plane if $r$ could be fixed\nby using an additional input; (b) the measured $R_1$ implies a limit on the\nstrong phase $\\Delta_1$; (c) due to the contribution from the color allowed\nelectroweak penguin, the minimal value of $R_1$ can be larger than unit. For\n$\\epsilon_1=0.2$ and $R_1=1.2$, the range of $65^\\circ \\leq \\gamma \\leq\n115^\\circ$ will be excluded, such bounds on $\\gamma$ are interesting and\ncomplimentary to the limits from global fit; (d) the dependences of extraction\nof $\\gamma$ on the variation of parameters $\\epsilon_1$, $\\rho$, $r_1$ and\nstrong phases are also studied.",

    "summary": "The flavor singlet axial charge has been a source of study in the last years\ndue to its relation to the so called {\\it Proton Spin Problem}. The relevant\nflavor singlet axial current is anomalous, i.e., its divergence contains a\npiece which is the celebrated $U_A(1)$ anomaly. This anomaly is intimately\nassociated with the $\\eta^\\prime$ meson, which gets its mass from it. When the\ngauge degrees of freedom of QCD are confined within a volume as is presently\nunderstood, the $U_A(1)$ anomaly is known to induce color anomaly leading to\n\"leakage\" of the color out of the confined volume (or bag). For consistency of\nthe theory, this anomaly should be cancelled by a boundary term. This ``color\nboundary term\" inherits part or most of the dynamics of the volume (i.e., QCD).\nIn this thesis, we exploit this mapping of the volume to the surface via the\ncolor boundary condition to perform a complete analysis of the flavor singlet\naxial charge in the chiral bag model using the Cheshire Cat Principle. This\nenables us to obtain the hitherto missing piece in the axial charge associated\nwith the gluon Casimir effect. The result is that the flavor singlet axial\ncharge is small independent of the confinement (bag) size ranging from the\nskyrmion picture to the MIT bag picture, thereby confirming the (albeit\napproximate) Cheshire Cat phenomenon.",

The striking quantitative agreement with\nthe dynamics of the particles fully confirms this procedure. We then show that\na very fast timescale can be singled out from a slower motion. This enables us\nto use an adiabatic approximation to derive an effective Hamiltonian that\ndescribes very well the long time dynamics.

One would expect that the existence of vast amount of dark\nmatter would lead to the formation of some dark galaxies or clusters which\ncould be seen by gravitational lensing events.This could serve as a direct\nevidence for dark matter. However, so far, there is no conclusive lensing event\npertaining to that.\n  In spite of absence of any direct evidence, there is a consensus among\nphysicists in favour of some form of non-baryonic dark matter. In this paper,\nwe take a different viewpoint and would like to view dark matter as an emergent\nphenomenon - very much like many such phenomena known in condensed matter\nsystems.\n  We propose here a novel mechanism involving Voids, which can, in principle\ngive rise to a difference between the gravitational and the inertial mass, and\nthereby, create effects similar to the dark matter.",

All three of the well collimated multiply imaged radio jets\nthat have been mapped on milli-arcsecond scales show some evidence of\nindependent bends in their images.

The probability of a radio jet being bent by small\nscale structure both inside and outside of the host lens is then investigate.\nThe known populations of dwarf galaxies and globular clusters are far too small\nto make this probability acceptable. A previously unknown population of massive\ndark objects is needed.

The finite system size allows three\ndifferent regimes for the equilibrium density profiles at T=0: a fully mixed\nstate, a partially mixed state in which the overlap between the boson and\nfermion clouds is decreasing, and a fully demixed state where the two clouds\nhave zero overlap.

A universal ``phase\ndiagram'' expressed in terms of simple scaling parameters is shown to be valid\nfor the transition to the regime of full demixing, inside which we identify\nseveral exotic configurations for the two phase-separated clouds in addition to\nsimple ones consisting of a core of bosons enveloped by fermions and \"vice\nversa\". With increasing temperature the main role of the growing thermal cloud\nof bosons is to transform some exotic configurations into more symmetric ones,\nuntil demixing is ultimately lost.

CoStar models yield an effective temperature of\n\\~30^{+2}_{-1} kK whereas more recent non-LTE line blanketed atmospheres with\nstellar winds indicate somewhat higher values, Teff~32--38 kK. This range in\nTeff is compatible with all observational constraints, including near-infrared\nphotometry and bolometric luminosity. The range 33-36 kK is also compatible\nwith the spectral type O5-O8 determined by Watson and Hanson (97) when recent\ndownward revisions of the effective temperature scale of O stars are taken into\naccount. The age of the ionizing star of G29.96 is found to be a few 10^6 yr,\nmuch older than the expected lifetime of UCHII regions. Accurate gas phase\nabundances are derived with the most robust results being Ne/S=7.5 and N/O=0.43\n(1.3 and 3.5 times the solar values, respectively).",

When their squared masses are plotted against the\nintrinsic orbital angular momenta {\\rm L}, $\\Delta^*$'s with even and odd\nparity can be described by the same Regge trajectory. For a given {\\rm L},\nnucleon resonances with spin {\\rm S}=3/2 are approximately degenerate in mass\nwith $\\Delta$ resonances. To which total angular momentum {\\rm L} and {\\rm S}\ncouple has no significant impact on the baryon mass. Nucleons with spin 1/2 are\nshifted in mass; the shift is - in units of squared masses - proportional to\nthe component in the wave function which is antisymmetric in spin and flavor.\nBased on these observations, a new baryon mass formula is proposed which\nreproduces nearly all known baryon masses. It is shown that the masses are\ncompatible with a quark-diquark picture while the richness of the\nexperimentally known states require three particles to participate in the\ndynamics. This conflict is resolved by proposing that quarks polarize the QCD\ncondensates and are surrounded by a polarization cloud shielding the color. A\nnew interpretation of constituent quarks as colored quark clusters emerges;\ntheir interaction is responsible for the mass spectrum. Fast flavor exchange\nbetween the colored quark clusters exhausts the dynamical richness of the\nthree-particle dynamics. The colored-quark-cluster model provides a mechanism\nin which the linear confinement potential can be traced to the increase of the\nvolume in which the condensates are polarized. The quark-spin magnetic moment\ninduces currents in the polarized condensates which absorb the quark-spin\nangular momentum: the proton spin is not carried by quark spins.

We first explore the minimization of\nthis free energy within a subspace, made of arbitrary superpositions of plane\nwaves with wavevectors of different orientations but same modulus. We show that\nthe standard second order FFLO phase transition is unstable and that a first\norder transition occurs at higher temperature. Within this subspace we prove\nthat it is favorable to have a real order parameter and that, among these\nstates, those with the smallest number of plane waves are prefered. This leads\nto an order parameter with a $\\cos({\\bf q}_{0}. {\\bf r})$ dependence, in\nagreement with preceding work.

    "summary": "The realization that GRBs are narrowly beamed implied that the actual rate of\nGRBs is much larger than the observed one. There are 500 unobserved GRBs for\neach observed one. The lack of a clear trigger makes it hard to detect these\nunobserved GRBs as orphan afterglows. At late time, hundreds or thousands of\nyears after a GRB, we expect to observe a GRB remnant (GRBR). These remnants\ncould be distinguished from the more frequent SNRs using their different\nmorphology. While SNRs are spherical, GRBRs that arise from a highly collimated\nflow, are expected to be initially nonspehrical. Using SPH simulations we\nfollow the evolution of a GRBR and calculate the image of the remnant produced\nby bremsstrahlung and by synchrotron emission. We find that the GRBR becomes\nspherical after $ \\sim 3000 {\\rm yr}(E_{51}/n)^{1/3}$ at $R\\sim 12{\\rm pc}\n(E_{51}/n)^{1/3}$, where $E_{51}$ is the initial energy in units of\n$10^{51}{\\rm erg}$ and $n$ is the surrounding ISM number density in ${\\rm\ncm}^{-3}$. We expect $0.5 (E_{51}/n)^{1/3}$ non-spherical GRBs per galaxy.\nNamely, we expect $\\sim ~ 20$ non spherical GRBRs with angular sizes $\\sim 1\n\\mu$arcsec within a distance of 10Mpc. These results are modified if there is\nan underlying spherical supernova. In this case the GRBR will remain spherical\nonly for $\\sim150 {\\rm yr} (E_{51}/n)^{1/3}$ and the number of non-spherical\nGRBRs is smaller by a factor of 10 and their size is smaller by a factor of 3.",

We analyze the first and second order\ncontributions to the mutual information as a function of the non-linearity and\nof the number of output units.

For a short-range repulsive\ninteraction, tunneling is dominated by the renormalization of the coupling\nconstant, which leads eventually to the charge-density wave instability. For a\nlong-range interaction, there exists an intermediate energy range in which the\nconductance obeys a power-law scaling form, similar to that of a 1D Luttinger\nliquid. The exponent is magnetic-field dependent, and more surprisingly, may be\npositive or negative, i. e., interactions may either suppress or enhance the\ntunneling conductance compared to its non-interacting value.

Radiative decay\nfollowing photoexcitation of resonant transitions is also significant. A\nself-consistent model of an irradiated cone of gas is capable of reproducing\nthe hydrogenic/heliumlike ionic line series in detail. The radial ionic column\ndensities we infer are consistent with absorption measurements (the warm\nabsorber) in Seyfert 1 galaxies. This strongly suggests that the emission\nspectrum we observe from NGC 1068 emanates from its warm absorber. The observed\nextent of the ionization-cone/warm absorber in NGC 1068 of about 300 pc implies\nthat a large fraction of the gas associated with generic warm absorbers may\ntypically exist on the hundreds-of-parsec scale rather than much closer to the\nnucleus (e.g., less than a parsec). Spatially-resolved spectroscopy using the\nLETGS of two distinct emission regions yields two noticeably different spectra.\nWe show that these differences are solely due to differing radial column\ndensities. A fairly flat distribution in ionization parameter is necessary to\nexplain the inferred radial ionic column densities of all spectra.

Using\nexact diagonalization, we demonstrate that the first hole is located at the\ncenter of the dot when the number of electrons $N$ is smaller than $\\sim 14$\nand is located away from the center for larger dots. The separation between\nfield strengths at which additional holes are introduced becomes small for\nlarge dots, explaining recent observations of a rapid increase in dot area when\nthe magnetic field is increased beyond the MDD stability limit.

The obtained map shows the central depression of\nthe the circumnuclear ring and the spiral arm structure.The arm-to-interarm\nratio of the 13CO(1-0) integrated intensity is 2-4. We also have found a\nfeature different from that found in the 12CO results. The 12CO/13CO ratio\nspatially varies, and shows high values (~20) for the interarm and the central\nregion, but low values(~10) for the arm. These indicate that there is a denser\ngas in the spiral arm than in the interarm. The distribution of the 13CO shows\na better correspondence with that of the H\\alpha emission than with the 12CO in\nthe disk region, except for the central region. We found that the 13CO emission\nis located on the downstream side of the 12CO arm, namely there is an offset\nbetween the 12CO and the 13CO as well as the H\\alpha emission. This suggests\nthat there is a time delay between the accumulation of gas caused by the\ndensity wave and dense gas formation, accordingly star formation. This time\ndelay is estimated to be ~10^7 yr based on the assumption of galactic rotation\nderived by the rotation curve and the pattern speed of M51. It is similar to\nthe growth timescale of a gravitational instability in the spiral arm of M51,\nsuggesting that the gravitational instability plays an important role for dense\ngas formation.",

Using a linear\nmagnetohydrodynamic stability analysis, we show that long-wavelength modes are\nprimarily destabilized by the entropy gradient and that such `convective' modes\ntransport angular momentum inwards. Moreover, the stability criteria for the\nconvective modes are the standard Hoiland criteria of hydrodynamics. By\ncontrast, shorter wavelength modes are primarily destabilized by magnetic\ntension and differential rotation. These `MRI' modes transport angular momentum\noutwards. The convection-dominated accretion flow (CDAF) model, which has been\nproposed for radiatively inefficient accretion onto a black hole, posits that\ninward angular momentum transport and outward energy transport by\nlong-wavelength convective fluctuations are crucial for determining the\nstructure of the accretion flow. Our analysis suggests that the CDAF model is\napplicable to a magnetohydrodynamic accretion flow provided the magnetic field\nsaturates at a sufficiently sub-equipartition value (plasma beta >> 1), so that\nlong-wavelength convective fluctuations can fit inside the accretion disk.\nNumerical magnetohydrodynamic simulations are required to determine whether\nsuch a sub-equipartition field is in fact obtained.",

The principles of\nour design are to tune the beam spectrum to the resonance energy for the matter\neffect, and to have the spectrum cut off rapidly above this energy. The matter\neffect amplifies the signal, and the cut-off suppresses backgrounds which\nfeed-down from higher energy. The signal-to-noise ratio is potentially better\nthan for any other conventional nu_mu beam experiment.\n  We find that a beam from Fermilab aimed at the Super-K detector has excellent\nsensitivity to sin^2(2theta_13) and the sign of Delta M^2. If the mass\nhierarchy is inverted, the beam can be run in antineutrino mode with a similar\nsignal-to-noise ratio, and event rate 55% as high as for the neutrino mode.\n  Combining the Fermilab beam with the JHF-Kamioka proposal adds very\ncomplementary information. We find good sensitivity to maximal CP violation for\nvalues of sin^2(2theta_13) ranging from 0.001 to 0.05.",

The other HII\ncomplexes, SgrB2 North and South, also show hard and highly absorbed X-ray\nemissions due possibly to the star formation activity. The composite X-ray\nspectrum of the other cloud member X-ray sources is fitted with a thin thermal\nplasma of about 10-keV temperature with the hydrogen column density (N_H) of\n1.3 x 10^23 H/cm^2, and the individual X-ray luminosity of a few times of\n10^31-32$ erg/s.

An alternative scenario of\nisolated white dwarfs powered by the Bondi-Hoyle accretion from the dense cloud\ngas is also discussed.

It\ntranspires that the static structure factor is fixed by this minimum condition\nto be the solution of the Yvon-Born-Green (YBG) equation. The residual\ninteractions between density waves are explicitly isolated in their Newtonian\nrepresentation and expanded by choosing the dominant objects in the phase space\nof the system, that can be represented by a dissipative term with memory and a\nrandom noise. This provides a mapping between deterministic and stochastic\ndynamics. Imposing the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (FDT) allows us to\ncalculate the memory kernel.

We compare\nthese two ways of proceeding, showing the necessity to enforce a new equation\nof constraint for the two schemes to be consistent. Thus, while in the first\n`Newtonian' representation a simple gaussian approximation for the random\nprocess leads easily to the Mean Spherical Approximation (MSA) for the statics\nand to MCT for the dynamics of the system, in the second case higher levels of\napproximation are required to have a fully consistent theory.",

    "summary": "We investigate the effects of molecular opacities on the evolution of TP-AGB\nstars that experience the third dredge-up, i.e. with surface abundances of\ncarbon and oxygen varying with time. To this aim, a routine is constructed to\nderive the molecular concentrations through dissociation equilibrium\ncalculations, and estimate the opacities due to H2, H2O, OH, C2, CN, and CO for\nany given density, temperature, and chemical composition of the gas. Then,\nsynthetic TP-AGB models with dredge-up are calculated by either 1) adopting the\nnewly developed routine, or 2) interpolating between fixed opacity tables for\nsolar chemical composition, which is the usual prescription in AGB evolution\ncalculations. The comparison between the two cases shows that the change in the\ndominant opacity sources, as the C/O ratio grows from below to above unity,\ncrucially affects the evolution of the effective temperature, i.e. causing a\nnotable cooling of the carbon-rich models (with C/O>1). From the comparison\nwith observational data, it turns out that TP-AGB models with variable\nmolecular opacities are able to reproduce the observed range of effective\ntemperatures, mass-loss rates, and wind expansion velocities of C-type giants\nin the solar neighbourhood, otherwise failed if assuming fixed molecular\nopacities for solar-scaled mixtures. Finally, we mention other important\nevolutionary and observational effects that result from the adoption of the\nvariable opacities, such as: i) significant shortening of the C-star phase due\nto the earlier onset of the super-wind; ii) consequent reduction of the carbon\nyields; iii) reproduction of the observed range of near-infrared colours of\nC-stars.",

    "summary": "Employing the PPN formalism the gravitomagnetic field in different metric\ntheories is considered in the analysis of the LAGEOS results. It will be shown\nthat there are several models that predict exactly the same effect that general\nrelativity comprises. In other words, these Earth satellites results can be\ntaken as experimental evidence that the orbital angular momentum of a body does\nindeed generate space--time geometry, notwithstanding they do not endow general\nrelativity with an outstanding status among metric theories. Additionally the\ncoupling spin--gravitomagnetic field is analyzed with the introduction of the\nRabi transitions that this field produces on a quantum system with spin 1/2.\nAfterwards, a continuous measurement of the energy of this system is\nintroduced, and the consequences upon the corresponding probabilities of the\ninvolved gravitomagnetic field will be obtained. Finally, it will be proved\nthat these proposals allows us, not only to confront against future experiments\nthe usual assumption of the coupling spin--gravotimagnetism, but also to\nmeasure some PPN parameters and to obtain functional dependences among them.",

An ordered\nlogic program is an extended logic program in which rules are named by unique\nterms, and in which preferences among rules are given by a set of atoms of form\ns < t where s and t are names. An ordered logic program is transformed into a\nsecond, regular, extended logic program wherein the preferences are respected,\nin that the answer sets obtained in the transformed program correspond with the\npreferred answer sets of the original program. Our approach allows the\nspecification of dynamic orderings, in which preferences can appear arbitrarily\nwithin a program. Static orderings (in which preferences are external to a\nlogic program) are a trivial restriction of the general dynamic case. First, we\ndevelop a specific approach to reasoning with preferences, wherein the\npreference ordering specifies the order in which rules are to be applied. We\nthen demonstrate the wide range of applicability of our framework by showing\nhow other approaches, among them that of Brewka and Eiter, can be captured\nwithin our framework. Since the result of each of these transformations is an\nextended logic program, we can make use of existing implementations, such as\ndlv and smodels. To this end, we have developed a publicly available compiler\nas a front-end for these programming systems.",

A semiclassical Monte Carlo\nalgorithm is developed to study the dephasing time, which is of qualitative\nnature but efficient in uncovering the dependence of dephasing time on field\namplitude for arbitrarily complicated magnetic-field modulation.

    "summary": "The Extended Supersymmetric Standard Model (ESSM), motivated on several\ngrounds, introduces two vector-like families [16+ 16-bar of SO(10)] with masses\nof order one TeV. In an earlier work, a successful pattern for fermion masses\nand mixings (to be called pattern I) has been proposed within a unified\nSO(10)-framework, based on MSSM, which makes seven predictions, in good accord\nwith observations, including V_{cb} ~ 0.04, and \\sin^22\\theta_{\\nu_\\mu\\nu_\\tau}\n\\~ 1. To exibit new phenomenological possibilities which may arise within ESSM,\nwe present here a variant pattern (to be called pattern II) for fermion masses\nand mixings, within the SO(10)/ESSM framework, which possesses the same degree\nof success as pattern I as regards the masses and mixings of all fermions\nincluding neutrinos. The main point of this paper is to first note that either\none of these two patterns, embedded in ESSM, would lead to a reduction in the\nLEP neutrino-counting from N_\\nu = 3 (in good agreement with the data) and also\nprovide a simple explanation of the (g-2)_\\mu-anomaly, as pointed out in the\naccompanying paper. They can, however, be distinguished from each other by (a)\na sharpening of our understanding of the true magnitude of the anomaly in\n\\nu_\\mu-nucleon scattering, recently reported by the NuTeV group, (b) improved\nmeasurements of m_t, m_H and m_W, (c) improved tests of e-\\mu\nlepton-universality in charged current processes, and (d) improvements in the\nmeasurements of V_{ud} and V_{us}. Pattern II (extended to ESSM) would predict\ndepartures from the standard model in the right direction with regard to (a)\nand (b), though not as regards (c) and (d) while Pattern I practically would\ncoincide with the standard model as regards its predictions for all four\nfeatures: (a)-(d).",

    "summary": "Recent radio and optical large scale jets' observations suggest a\ntwo-component jet morphology, consisting of a fast central spine surrounded\nwith a boundary layer with a velocity shear. We study radiation of electrons\naccelerated at such boundary layers as an option for standard approaches\ninvolving internal shocks in jets. The acceleration process in the boundary\nlayer yields in a natural way a two component electron distribution: a\npower-law continuum with a bump at the energy, where energy gains equal\nradiation losses, followed by a cut-off. For such distributions we derive the\nobserved spectra of synchrotron and inverse-Compton radiation, including\ncomptonization of synchrotron and CMB photons. Under simple assumptions of\nenergy equipartition between the relativistic particles and the magnetic field,\nthe relativistic jet velocity at large scales and a turbulent character of the\nshear layer, the considered radiation can substantially contribute to the jet\nradiative output. In the considered conditions the synchrotron emission is\ncharacterized by a spectral index of the radio-to-optical continuum being\napproximately constant along the jet. A characteristic feature of the obtained\nbroad-band synchrotron spectrum is an excess at X-ray frequencies, similar to\nthe one observed in some objects by Chandra. As compared to the uniform jet\nmodels, the velocity shear across the radiating boundary region leads to\ndecrease and frequency dependence of the observed jet-counterjet radio\nbrightness asymmetry. We conclude that a careful investigation of the\nobservational data looking for the derived effects can allow to evaluate the\nrole of the boundary layer acceleration processes and/or impose constraints for\nthe physical parameters of such layers in large scale jets.",

It is interesting to note\nthat by a simple logical back projection the original input state can be\nrecovered in most cases. We also prove that it is not possible for a sequence\nof unitary operators working on a net to make it move from an aperiodic regime\nto a periodic one, unlike some classical cases where phase-locking happens in\ncourse of evolution.

We consider\nthe moduli space of pairs (P,f), where P is a principal G-bundle on E, and f is\na meromorphic section of the adjoint group bundle. We show:\n  1) The moduli space admits an algebraic Poisson structure. It is related to\nthe poisson structures on loop groupoids, constructed by Etingof and Varchenko,\nusing Felder's elliptic solutions of the Classical Dynamical Yang-Baxter\nEquation.\n  2) The symplectic leaves are finite dimensional. A symplectic leaf is\ndetermined by labeling, finitely many points of E, each by a dominant\nco-character of the maximal torus of G.\n  3) Each leaf is an algebraically completely integrable system.",

A period of 220 days (416 days in the near-infrared) is\ncovered from the first observation obtained a few days before maximum light.\nSpectroscopic observations are also discussed. Using as a distance calibrator\nthe Type Ia SN 2000E, which occurred some months later in the same galaxy, and\nfitting a blackbody law to the photometric data we obtain a maximum bolometric\nluminosity for SN 1999el of $\\sim 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$. In general, the\nphotometric properties of SN 1999el are very similar to those of SN 1998S, a\nbright and well studied Type IIn SN, showing a fast decline in all observed\nbands similar to those of Type II-L SNe. The differences with SN 1998S are\nanalyzed and ascribed to the differences in a pre-existing circumstellar\nenvelope in which dust was already present at the moment of the SN outburst. We\ninfer that light echoes may play a possibly significant role in affecting the\nobserved properties of the light curves, although improved theoretical models\nare needed to account for the data. We conclude that mass loss in the\nprogenitor RG stars is episodic and occurs in an asymmetric way. This implies\nthat collapsing massive stars appear as normal Type II SN if this occurs far\nfrom major mass loss episodes, whereas they appear as Type IIn SNe if a large\nmass loss episode is in progress.",

On\nthe other hand, the co-moving space density and the sizes of luminous disks\nhave not changed significantly since z=1.

    "summary": "An interesting analog circuit for simulating a signal with fluctuations\nhaving a probability density function with a power tail has recently been\nproposed and constructed. The exponent of the power law can be fixed by tuning\nan appropriate circuit element. The proposal is to use the circuit as a\nsimulator-generator of financial market fluctuations and as a tool for risk\nestimations and forecasts. We present a discussion of the stability conditions\nfor multiplicative noise and an exhaustive analysis of the power law\nfluctuation generator in connection with the electronic components and their\nparameters. From our studies one can conclude that the proposal is not adequate\nto provide a confident experimental scheme to follow the fluctuations of the\nfinancial market due to both electronic implementation and to difficulties in\nparameter tuning.",

We consider the\ncorresponding string theory orbifold and calculate the modular invariant\none-loop partition function. In this case there is a strong parallel with the\nBTZ black hole. The higher dimensional cosmologies have a time-like curvature\nsingularity in the intermediate region. In some cases the string coupling can\nbe made small throughout all of space-time but string corrections become\nimportant at the singularity.

It\nseems that Leibniz equivalence makes it impossible to consider the points of\nthe space-time manifold as physically individuated without recourse to\ndynamical individuating fields. Various authors have posited that the metric\nfield itself can be used in this way, but nobody so far has considered the\nproblem of explicitly distilling the metrical fingerprint of point-events from\nthe gauge-dependent components of the metric field. Working in the Hamiltonian\nformulation of general relativity, and building on the results of Lusanna and\nPauri (2002), we show how Bergmann and Komar's intrinsic pseudo-coordinates\n(based on the value of curvature invariants) can be used to provide a physical\nindividuation of point-events in terms of the true degrees of freedom (the\nDirac observables) of the gravitational field, and we suggest how this\nconceptual individuation could in principle be implemented with a well-defined\nempirical procedure.

Our starting\npoint is the ``universal Hamiltonian''--valid in the g->oo limit--which\nincludes the charging energy, the single-electron energies (described by random\nmatrix theory), and the average exchange interaction. We then calculate the\nmagnitude of the most relevant finite g corrections, namely, the effect of\nsurface charge, the ``gate'' effect, and the fluctuation of the residual e-e\ninteraction. The resulting zero-temperature peak spacing distribution has\ncorrections of order Delta/sqrt(g). For typical values of the e-e interaction\n(r_s ~ 1) and simple geometries, theory does indeed predict an asymmetric\ndistribution with a significant even/odd effect. The width of the distribution\nis of order 0.3 Delta, and its dominant feature is a large peak for the odd\ncase, reminiscent of the delta-function in the g->oo limit. We consider finite\ntemperature effects next. Only after their inclusion is good agreement with the\nexperimental results obtained. Even relatively low temperature causes large\nmodifications in the peak spacing distribution: (a) its peak is dominated by\nthe even distribution at kT ~ 0.3 Delta (at lower T a double peak appears); (b)\nit becomes more symmetric; (c) the even/odd effect is considerably weaker; (d)\nthe delta-function is completely washed-out; and (e) fluctuation of the\ncoupling to the leads becomes relevant.

    "summary": "We present elastic and inelastic neutron scattering results on highly oxygen\nordered YBa2Cu3O6.5 ortho-II. We find no evidence for the presence of ordered\nmagnetic moments to a sensitivity of 0.003 Bohr magnetons, an order of\nmagnitude smaller than has been suggested in theories of orbital or\nd-density-wave (DDW) currents. The absence of sharp elastic peaks, shows that\nthe d-density-wave phase is not present, at least for the superconductor with\nthe doping of 6.5 and the ordered ortho-II structure. We cannot exclude the\npossibility that a broad peak may exist with extremely short-range DDW\ncorrelations. For less ordered or more doped crystals it is possible that\ndisorder may lead to static magnetism. We have also searched for the large\nnormal state spin gap that is predicted to exist in an ordered DDW phase.\nInstead of a gap we find that the Q-correlated spin susceptibility persists to\nthe lowest energies studied, 6 meV. Our results are compatible with the\ncoexistence of superconductivity with orbital currents, but only if they are\ndynamic, and exclude a sharp phase transition to an ordered d-density-wave\nphase.",

In process\nphysics the fundamental assumption is that reality is to be modelled as\nself-organising semantic (or internal or relational) information using a\nself-referentially limited neural network model. Previous progress in process\nphysics included the demonstration that space and quantum physics are emergent\nand unified, with time a distinct non-geometric process, that quantum phenomena\nare caused by fractal topological defects embedded in and forming a growing\nthree-dimensional fractal process-space, which is essentially a quantum foam.\nOther features of the emergent physics were: quantum field theory with emergent\nflavour and confined colour, limited causality and the Born quantum measurement\nmetarule, inertia, time-dilation effects, gravity and the equivalence\nprinciple, a growing universe with a cosmological constant, black holes and\nevent horizons, and the emergence of classicality. Here general relativity and\nthe technical language of general covariance is seen not to be fundamental but\na phenomenological construct, arising as an amalgam of two distinct phenomena:\nthe `gravitational' characteristics of the emergent quantum foam for which\n`matter' acts as a sink, and the classical `spacetime' measurement protocol,\nbut with the later violated by quantum measurement processes. Quantum gravity,\nas manifested in the emergent Quantum Homotopic Field Theory of the\nprocess-space or quantum foam, is logically prior to the emergence of the\ngeneral relativity phenomenology, and cannot be derived from it.",

As an instructive generalization, we also calculate the\nscattering function S_c(q,t;M,N) for the central piece of length M < N of the\nchain. Using the full reptation model, we treat global creep, tube length\nfluctuations, and internal relaxation within a consistent and unified approach.\nOur theory concentrates on the universal aspects of reptational motion, and our\nresults in all details show excellent agreement with our simulations of the\nEvans-Edwards model, provided we allow for a phenomenological prefactor which\naccounts for non-universal effects of the micro-structure of the Monte Carlo\nchain, present for short times. Previous approaches to the coherent structure\nfunction can be analyzed as special limits of our theory. First, the effects of\ninternal relaxation can be isolated by studying the limit $N \\to \\infty$, M\nfixed. The results do not support the model of a `Rouse chain in a tube'. We\ntrace this back to the non-equilibrium initial conditions of the latter model.\nSecond, in the limit of long chains $(M = N \\to \\infty)$ and times large\ncompared to the internal relaxation time $(t/N^2 \\to \\infty)$, our theory\nreproduces the results of the primitive chain model. This limiting form applies\nonly to extremely long chains, and for chain lengths accessible in practice,\neffects of, e.g., tube length fluctuations are not negligible.",

Third, we apply the above to a\nsymmetric algebra A.

Finally, we show that for an idempotent e of A, a\ntilting complex for eAe extends to a recollement tilting complex for A, and\nthat its standard equivalence induces an equivalence between $\\cat{Mod}A/AeA$\nand $\\cat{Mod}B/BfB$.",

A bracketing range of choices for the redshift of formation,\nspectral energy evolution models and population density evolution, leads to the\nconclusion that the sky densities should be around 10^7 per square degree at\n1nJy (m_AB=31.4 mag) in bands around 4 microns. Such high sky densities begin\nto present a confusion problem at these wavelengths to diffraction limited 6m\nclass telescopes.

On the\nother hand they are an exceptionally interesting ``second light'' population in\ntheir own right. Depending on the details of galaxy assembly, the clusters will\nhave a noticeable cross-correlation with galaxies on scales of about 20 arcsec,\nor less, depending on the details of the buildup of galaxy assembly after\nglobular cluster formation.

    "summary": "The original Zee model can easily accommodate a bi-maximal mixing solution\nfor the atmospheric and solar neutrino problems. From the most recent fit to\nthe data we obtain a set of parameters for the Zee model. However, the recent\nclaim on a positive signal observed in a neutrinoless double beta decay, which\nrequires a nonzero $m_{ee}$, cannot be accounted for by the Zee model. Based on\nthe observed neutrino mass-square differences and mixings, we derive a few\ngeneral patterns for the neutrino mass matrix in the flavor basis, which can\ncorrectly describe the atmospheric, solar, and $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ data. Finally,\nwe investigate a few possible extensions to the Zee model, which can give the\nrequired mass patterns.",

In particular the\nvalues for the minimum and maximum allowed radius, defined by irradiation and\ndielectric losses, respectively, are obtained in terms of the complex\ndielectric constant of the involved media. The same approach is employed in the\nanalysis of the limit allowed frequencies of a fixed family of mode, leading to\nthe definition of the \"ideal\" frequency band. The role of the transverse mode\nis then discussed, and the \"effective\" frequency band is introduced and\ndetermined both in simple disc and circular ring resonators. The extension of\nthe effective band is limited at least by a factor 3, in terms of decades, in\ncomparison to the extension of the ideal one; this limitation, due to the\npresence of transverse modes, can be overcome using suitably designed\nnon-homogeneous resonators, as discussed in a following companion paper.",

Using simple two-body potentials that reproduce the deuteron\nbinding, we obtain that the three-body system binds at about 7.5 MeV. We then\nconsider two types of residual pionic corrections in the dynamical equation;\none related to the 2PI-exchange three-body diagram, the other to the\n1PI-exchange three-body diagram.

However, because of the different orientations\nof the magnetic field over the surface of the neutron star (NS), it is commonly\nassumed that the net observed polarization will be significantly reduced as the\npolarization from different regions will cancel each other. We show that the\nbirefringence of the magnetized QED vacuum decouples the polarization modes in\nthe magnetosphere; therefore, the direction of the polarization follows the\ndirection of the magnetic field up to a large distance from the stellar\nsurface. At this distance, the rays that leave the surface and are destined for\nour detectors pass through only a small solid angle; consequently, the\npolarization direction of the emission originating in different regions will\ntend to align together. The net observed polarization of the thermal radiation\nof NSs should therefore be very large. Measurement of this polarization will be\nthe first direct evidence of the birefringence of the magnetized vacuum due to\nQED and a direct probe of behavior of the vacuum at magnetic fields of order of\nand above the critical QED field of 4.4 x 10 13 G.

Using soliton and\nbreather solutions, they demonstrate the lack of local well-posedness for these\nequations below their respective endpoint regularities. In this paper, we study\nthe defocusing analogues of these equations, namely defocusing NLS, defocusing\nmKdV, and real KdV, all in one spatial dimension, for which suitable soliton\nand breather solutions are unavailable. We construct for each of these\nequations classes of modified scattering solutions, which exist globally in\ntime, and are asymptotic to solutions of the corresponding linear equations up\nto explicit phase shifts. These solutions are used to demonstrate lack of local\nwell-posedness in certain Sobolev spaces,in the sense that the dependence of\nsolutions upon initial data fails to be uniformly continuous. In particular, we\nshow that the mKdV flow is not uniformly continuous in the $L^2$ topology,\ndespite the existence of global weak solutions at this regularity.\n  Finally, we investigate the KdV equation at the endpoint regularity\n$H^{-3/4}$, and construct solutions for both the real and complex KdV\nequations. The construction provides a nontrivial time interval $[-T,T]$ and a\nlocally Lipschitz continuous map taking the initial data in $H^{-3/4}$ to a\ndistributional solution $u \\in C^0 ([-T,T]; $H^{-3/4})$ which is uniquely\ndefined for all smooth data.

    "summary": "Hot subluminous stars lying up to 0.7 mag below the extreme horizontal branch\n(EHB) are found in the UV color-magnitude diagrams of omega Cen and NGC 2808.\nSuch stars are unexplained by canonical HB theory. In order to explore the\norigin of these subluminous stars, we evolved a set of low-mass stars from the\nmain sequence through the helium-core flash to the HB for a wide range in the\nmass loss along the red-giant branch (RGB). Stars with the largest mass loss\nevolve off the RGB to high effective temperatures before igniting helium in\ntheir cores. Our results indicate that the subluminous EHB stars, as well as\nthe gap within the EHB of NGC 2808, can be explained if these stars undergo a\nlate helium-core flash on the white-dwarf cooling curve. Under these conditions\nthe flash convection will penetrate into the stellar envelope, thereby mixing\nmost, if not all, of the envelope hydrogen into the hot helium- burning\ninterior. This phenomenon is analogous to the \"born-again\" scenario for\nproducing hydrogen-deficient stars during a very late helium-shell flash.\n\"Flash mixing\" greatly enhances the envelope helium and carbon abundances and,\nas a result, leads to an abrupt increase in the HB effective temperature. We\nargue that the EHB gap in NGC 2808 is caused by this theoretically predicted\ndichotomy in the HB morphology. Using new helium- and carbon-rich stellar\natmospheres, we show that the flash-mixed stars have the same reduced UV flux\nas the subluminous EHB stars. Moreover, we demonstrate that models without\nflash mixing lie, at most, ~0.1 mag below the EHB and hence fail to explain the\nobservations. Flash mixing may also provide a new evolutionary channel for\nproducing the high gravity, He-rich sdO and sdB stars.",

We have made a simple lens model and a rough estimate\nof the reddening in the immediate environment of the quasar which suggests that\nthe quasar is intrinsically very luminous and is accreting at close to the\nEddington limit of its ~10^9 M_sun black hole. The lensing galaxy has a small\namount of dust which is responsible for some excess reddening observed in the\nfainter image of the quasar, but is otherwise a fairly typical massive\nelliptical galaxy. We model the selection effects working against the detection\nof red quasars in both lensed and unlensed samples. We show that these\nselection effects are very effective at removing even lightly-reddened high\nredshift quasars from magnitude-limited samples, whether they are lensed or\nnot. This suggests that the red quasar population in general could be very\nlarge, and in particular the class of iron broad absorption line quasars of\nwhich J100424.9+122922 is a member may be much larger than their rarity in\nmagnitude-limited samples would suggest.",

The key parameter is the ratio of\nthe cooling time to the dynamical crossing time $\\eta$. The isobaric density\nperturbations of sizes $\\gtrsim 15$ pc in media with mean density $\\sim 1$\ncm$^{-3}$ develop inflow motions with Mach number larger than 0.5 and a shock\nthat propagates outwards from the condensation and brings the surrounding\nmedium out of thermal equilibrium. The time for the dynamical transient state\nto subside ranges from 4 to 30 Myr for initial density perturbations of 20% and\nsizes 3 to 75 pc. By the time the condensations have formed, a substantial\nfraction of the mass is still traversing the unstable range and, therefore,\nclouds formed by TI should be bounded by accreting gas traversing the unstable\nrange, rather than by sharp transitions to the stable warm phase. In the\npresence of random velocity forcing the condensation process can be suppressed\nfor arbitrarily long times if the forcing causes a moderate rms Mach number\n($\\gtrsim 0.3$) and extends to small enough scales that $\\eta>1$. We suggest\nthat these mechanisms may be at the origin of the relatively large amounts of\ngas mass in the unstable regime. We remark that in the (stable) warm diffuse\nmedium, $\\eta>1$ for velocity perturbations of scales up to several pc. The\nflow's response to them is thus nearly adiabatic, and relatively weakly\ncompressible, consistent with observations that suggest a nearly Kolmogorov\npower spectrum in this medium.",

The\nmain technical difficulty in the SO(3)-monopole program relating the\nSeiberg-Witten and Donaldson invariants has been to compute intersection\npairings on links of strata of reducible SO(3) monopoles, namely the moduli\nspaces of Seiberg-Witten monopoles lying in lower-level strata of the Uhlenbeck\ncompactification of the moduli space of SO(3) monopoles [arXiv:dg-ga/9710032].\nIn this monograph, we prove --- modulo a gluing theorem which is an extension\nof our earlier work in [arXiv:math/9907107] --- that these intersection\npairings can be expressed in terms of topological data and Seiberg-Witten\ninvariants of the four-manifold. This conclusion is analogous to the\nKotschick-Morgan conjecture concerning the wall-crossing formula for Donaldson\ninvariants of a four-manifold with $b_2^+=1$; that wall-crossing formula and\nthe resulting structure of Donaldson invariants for four-manifolds with\n$b_2^+=1$ were established, assuming the Kotschick-Morgan conjecture, by\nGoettsche [arXiv:alg-geom/9506018] and Goettsche and Zagier\n[arXiv:alg-geom/9612020]. In this monograph, we reduce the proof of the\nKotschick-Morgan conjecture to an extension of previously established gluing\ntheorems for anti-self-dual SO(3) connections (see [arXiv:math/9812060] and\nreferences therein). Since the first version of our monograph was circulated,\napplications of our results have appeared in the proof of Property P for knots\nby Kronheimer and Mrowka [arXiv:math/0311489] and work of Sivek on Donaldson\ninvariants for symplectic four-manifolds [arXiv:1301.0377].",

In some cases,\nprevious methods can give erroneous results, due to the usual assumption of\nvanishing boundary conditions being invalid for those particular systems.\nSolutions are given to this boundary-term problem for all the cases where it is\nknown to occur: two-photon absorption and the single-mode laser. We also\nprovide some brief guidelines on how to apply the stochastic gauge method to\nother systems in general, quantify the freedom of choice in the resulting\nequations, and make a comparison to related recent developments.",

This main peak is followed by a 2 sec decreasing tail. We\nfound no evidence of any precursor or any extended `afterglow' tail to this\nburst. We present the preliminary spectral fits of the total emission of this\nflare as observed by the FREGATE instrument between 7 and 150 keV. The best fit\nis obtained with a model consisting of two blackbody components of temperatures\n4.15 keV and 10.4 keV. A thermal bremsstrahlung can not be fitted to this\nspectrum.

The cyclic symmetry is reflected in some models in the existence of a\nfamily universal anomalous U(1)_A. We analyze the FCNC and CP violation effects\nin a model with a dominant U(1)_A SUSY breaking. In this theories, new sources\nof FC are always suppressed with respect to the average sfermion masses. We\nmake a phenomenological analysis of these effects and find that in most of the\ncases they are in qualitative agreement with the phenomenological limits. The\nmost sensitive low-energy observables to these new FC sources are the\n$\\epsilon_K$ parameter, measuring indirect CP violation in neutral kaon mixing\nand EDMs. These observables set important constraints on the structure of the\nsfermion mass matrices, but do not require a large fine-tuning of the initial\nparameters and can be satisfied in most realistic constructions.",

The mechanism is based on the interplay\nof the hybridization of band states (conduction or valence) with localized\nimpurity (donor or acceptor) states and the direct exchange interaction between\nlocalized spins and the band states. The indirect exchange coupling between two\nimpurities occurs when the wavefunctions of the corresponding localized donor\n(acceptor) states overlap.

    "summary": "The prior knowledge of the gravitational waveform from compact binary systems\nmakes matched filtering an attractive detection strategy. This detection method\ninvolves the filtering of the detector output with a set of theoretical\nwaveforms or templates. One of the most important factors in this strategy is\nknowing how many templates are needed in order to reduce the loss of possible\nsignals. In this study we calculate the number of templates and computational\npower needed for a one-step search for gravitational waves from inspiralling\nbinary systems. We build on previous works by firstly expanding the\npost-Newtonian waveforms to 2.5-PN order and secondly, for the first time,\ncalculating the number of templates needed when using P-approximant waveforms.\nThe analysis is carried out for the four main first-generation interferometers,\nLIGO, GEO600, VIRGO and TAMA. As well as template number, we also calculate the\ncomputational cost of generating banks of templates for filtering GW data. We\ncarry out the calculations for two initial conditions. In the first case we\nassume a minimum individual mass of $1 M_{\\odot}$ and in the second, we assume\na minimum individual mass of $5 M_{\\odot}$. We find that, in general, we need\nmore P-approximant templates to carry out a search than if we use standard PN\ntemplates. This increase varies according to the order of PN-approximation, but\ncan be as high as a factor of 3 and is explained by the smaller span of the\nP-approximant templates as we go to higher masses. The promising outcome is\nthat for 2-PN templates the increase is small and is outweighed by the known\nrobustness of the 2-PN P-approximant templates.",

We have shown that the ordering of the Rb vacancies in the\nnonstoichiometric compounds have a major detrimental effect on the\nsuperconducting temperature Tc.The order-disorder transition is first order\nonly near x = 0.25, where it cannot be quenched effectively and Tc is reduced\nbelow 1K. We found that the high Tc's which were sometimes deduced from\nresistivity measurements, and attributed to compounds with .25 < x < .30, are\nto be ascribed to interfacial superconductivity which generates spectacular\nnon-linear effects. We also clarified the effect of acid etching and set more\nprecisely the low-rubidium-content boundary of the hexagonal phase.This work\nmakes clear that Tc would increase continuously (from 2 K to 5.5 K) as we\napproach this boundary (x = 0.20), if no ordering would take place - as its is\napproximately the case in CsxWO3. This behaviour is reminiscent of the\ntetragonal tungsten bronze NaxWO3 and asks the same question : what mechanism\nis responsible for this large increase of Tc despite the considerable\nassociated reduction of the electron density of state ? By reviewing the other\navailable data on these bronzes we conclude that the theoretical models which\nare able to answer this question are probably those where the instability of\nthe lattice plays a major role and, particularly, the model which call upon\nlocal structural excitations (LSE), associated with the missing alkali atoms.",

We prove an inequality which binds the reduction\nof the electric-field fluctuations to their duration. The bigger the level of\nfluctuations-suppression the shorter its duration. As an example of the\napplication of this inequality in the case of squeezed light whose phase is\ncontrolled with 1% accuracy we derive a limit of -15dB on the allowed degree of\nsqueezing.",

We see that one-loop potential behaves like\nthat in the commutative sphere and the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism of the\nradiatively symmetry breaking could be also shown in the fuzzy sphere system.\nIn the two-loop level, we use the heavy-mass approximation and the\nhigh-temperature approximation to perform the evaluations. The results show\nthat both of the planar and nonplanar Feynman diagrams have inclinations to\nrestore the symmetry breaking in the tree level. However, the contributions\nfrom planar diagrams will dominate over those from nonplanar diagrams by a\nfactor N^2. Thus, at heavy-mass limit or high-temperature system the quantum\nfield on the fuzzy sphere will behave like those on the commutative sphere. We\nalso see that there is a drastic reduction of the degrees of freedom in the\nnonplanar diagrams when the particle wavelength is smaller than the\nnoncommutativity scale.",

These oscillations are triggered by\nthe running of soft $({\\rm mass})^2$ stemming from the nonzero energy density\nof the Universe. However, this is quite different from the standard $\\rm\nQ$-ball formation. The running in presence of gauge and Yukawa couplings\nbecomes strong if $m_{1/2}/m_0$ is sufficiently large. Moreover, the $\\rm\nQ$-balls which are formed during the early oscillations constantly evolve, due\nto the redshift of the Hubble-induced soft mass, until the low-energy\nsupersymmtery breaking becomes dominant. For smaller $m_{1/2}/m_0$, $\\rm\nQ$-balls are not formed during early oscillations because of the shrinking of\nthe instability band due to the Hubble expansion. In this case the $\\rm\nQ$-balls are formed only at the weak scale, but typically carry smaller\ncharges, as a result of their amplitude redshift. Therefore, the Hubble-induced\ncorrections to the flat directions give rise to a successful $\\rm Q$-ball\ncosmology.",

When the energy of the hole lies near the vHs a\nvariation of the resistivity linear with temperature (T) is calculated and when\nthe FL lies far from the vHs, a quadratic law is obtained at low temperature\nand becomes linear at higher T. We find that the transition temperature T* is\nsimply related to the distance between the Fermi level and the vHs.

We expand on the Cheng & Cheng model by deriving the emission spectrum\nand duration in the standard fireball shock model. A typical duration of the\nemission is ~ 10^3 seconds, and the time-integrated scattered photon spectrum\nis nu^{-(p+6)/4}, where p is the index of the electron energy distribution\nbehind internal shocks. This is slightly harder than the synchrotron photon\nspectrum, nu^{-(p+2)/2}.

    "summary": "We study the observational constraints on the growth of massive black holes\n(BHs) in galactic nuclei. We use the velocity dispersions of early-type\ngalaxies obtained by the SDSS and the relation between BH mass and velocity\ndispersion to estimate the local BH mass density to be 2.5x10^5 Msun/Mpc^3. We\nalso use the QSO luminosity function from the 2dF Redshift Survey to estimate\nthe BH mass density accreted during optically bright QSO phases. The local BH\nmass density is consistent with the density accreted during optically bright\nQSO phases if QSOs have an efficiency 0.1. By studying the continuity equation\nfor the BH mass distribution, including the effect of BH mergers, we find\nrelations between the local BH mass function and the QSO luminosity function.\nIf the BH mass is assumed to be conserved during BH mergers, comparison of the\npredicted relations with the observations suggests that luminous QSOs\n(L_{bol}>10^{46} erg/s) have a high efficiency (e.g. 0.2), and the growth of\nhigh-mass BHs (>10^8 Msun) comes mainly from accretion during optically bright\nQSO phases, or that luminous QSOs have a super-Eddington luminosity. If\nluminous QSOs are not accreting with super-Eddington luminosities and the\ngrowth of low-mass BHs also occurs mainly during optically bright QSO phases,\nless luminous QSOs must accrete with a low efficiency <0.1; alternatively, they\nmay accrete with high efficiency, but a significant fraction should be\nobscured. We estimate that the mean lifetime of luminous QSOs is (3-13)x10^7\nyr, which is comparable to the Salpeter time. We also investigate the case in\nwhich total BH mass decreases during BH mergers due to gravitational radiation,\nand the observations again suggest that BHs in most luminous QSOs are Kerr BHs\naccreting with an efficiency >0.1.",

    "summary": "The Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model has been extensively studied by many\nresearchers. In previous work we have generalized the NJL model to include a\ncovariant model of confinement. In the present work we consider further\nmodification of the model so as to reproduce the type of Euclidean-space\nmomentum- dependent quark mass values obtained in lattice simulations of QCD.\nThis may be done by introducing a nonlocal interaction, while preserving the\nchiral symmetry of the Lagrangian. In other work on nonlocal models, by other\nresearchers, the momentum dependence of the quark self-energy is directly\nrelated to the regularization scheme. In contrast, in our work, the\nregularization is independent of the nonlocality we introduce. It is of\ninterest to note that the value of the condensate ratio,\n$<\\bar{s}s>/<\\bar{u}d>$, is about 1.7 when evaluated using chiral perturbation\ntheory and is only about 1.1 in standard applications of the NJL model. We find\nthat our nonlocal model can reproduce the larger value of the condensate ratio\nwhen reasonable values are used for the strength of the 't Hooft interaction.\n(In an earlier study of the $\\eta$(547) and $\\eta$'(958) mesons, we found that\nuse of the larger value of the condensate ratio led to a very good fit to the\nmixing angles and decay constants of these mesons.) We also study the density\ndependence of both the quark condensate and the momentum-dependent quark mass\nvalues. Without the addition of new parameters, we reproduce the density\ndependence of the condensate given by a well-known model- independent\nexpression valid for small baryon density.",

The delay in observer's time introduced by the jet traversing\nthe envelope should not be long compared to the duration of gamma-ray emission;\nalso, the jet should not be swallowed by a spherical explosion it powers. The\nonly stellar progenitors that comfortably satisfy these constraints, if one\nassumes that jets move ballistically within their host stars, are compact\ncarbon-oxygen or helium post-Wolf-Rayet stars (type Ic or Ib supernovae); type\nII supernovae are ruled out. Notably, very massive stars do not appear capable\nof producing the observed bursts at any redshift unless the stellar envelope is\nstripped prior to collapse. The presence of a dense stellar wind places an\nupper limit on the Lorentz factor of the jet in the internal shock model;\nhowever, this constraint may be evaded if the wind is swept forward by a photon\nprecursor. Shock breakout and cocoon blowout are considered individually;\nneither presents a likely source of precursors for cosmological GRBs.\n  These envelope constraints could conceivably be circumvented if jets are\nlaterally pressure-confined while traversing the outer stellar envelope. If so,\njets responsible for observed GRBs must either have been launched from a region\nseveral hundred kilometers wide, or have mixed with envelope material as they\ntravel.

    "summary": "When matter undergoes a phase transition from one state to another, usually a\nchange in symmetry is observed, as some of the symmetries exhibited are said to\nbe spontaneously broken. The superconducting phase transition in the underdoped\nhigh-Tc superconductors is rather unusual, in that it is not a mean-field\ntransition as other superconducting transitions are. Instead, it is observed\nthat a pseudo-gap in the electronic excitation spectrum appears at temperatures\nT* higher than Tc, while phase coherence, and superconductivity, are\nestablished at Tc (Refs. 1, 2). One would then wish to understand if T* is just\na crossover, controlled by fluctuations in order which will set in at the lower\nTc (Refs. 3, 4), or whether some symmetry is spontaneously broken at T* (Refs.\n5-10). Here, using angle-resolved photoemission with circularly polarized\nlight, we find that, in the pseudogap state, left-circularly polarized photons\ngive a different photocurrent than right-circularly polarized photons, and\ntherefore the state below T* is rather unusual, in that it breaks time reversal\nsymmetry11. This observation of a phase transition at T* provides the answer to\na major mystery of the phase diagram of the cuprates. The appearance of the\nanomalies below T* must be related to the order parameter that sets in at this\ncharacteristic temperature .",

For the same reason, the\nspecific heat of the CFL phase is also dominated by the Goldstone modes.\nNotwithstanding this, both the emissivity and the specific heat from the\nmassive modes remain rather small, because of their extremely small number\ndensities. The values of the emissivity and the specific heat imply that the\ntimescale for the cooling of the CFL core in isolation is $\\sim 10^{26}$ y,\nwhich makes the CFL phase invisible as the exterior layers of normal matter\nsurrounding the core will continue to cool through significantly more rapid\nprocesses.

In different theoretical work the trace formulae have been extended to\nhigher orders of hbar.

Here, we propose an alternative global model\nfor the flows surrounding YSOs. In addition to a central accretion-ejection\nengine driving the jet, the molecular outflow is powered by the infalling\nmatter and follows a circulation pattern around the central object without\nnecessarily being entrained by a jet. It is shown that the model produces a\nheated pressure-driven outflow with magneto-centrifugal acceleration and\ncollimation. We report solutions for the three different parts of this\nself-similar model, i.e. the jet, the infalling envelope and the circulating\nmatter that eventually forms the molecular outflow. This new picture of the\naccretion/outflow phase provides a possible explanation for several observed\nproperties of YSO outflows. The most relevant ones are the presence of high\nmass molecular outflows around massive protostars, and a realistic fraction\n(typically 0.1) of the accretion flow that goes into the jet.",

    "summary": "Modern quantum information theory deals with an idealized situation when the\nspacetime dependence of quantum phenomena is neglected. However the\ntransmission and processing of (quantum) information is a physical process in\nspacetime. Therefore such basic notions in quantum information theory as qubit,\nchannel, composite systems and entangled states should be formulated in space\nand time. In particlular we suggest that instead of a two level system (qubit)\nthe basic notion in a relativistic quantum information theory should be a\nnotion of an elementary quantum system, i.e. an infinite dimensional Hilbert\nspace $H$ invariant under an irreducible representation of the Poincare group\nlabeled by $[m,s]$ where $m\\geq 0$ is mass and $s=0,1/2,1,...$ is spin. We\nemphasize an importance of consideration of quantum information theory from the\npoint of view of quantum field theory. We point out and discuss a fundamental\nfact that in quantum field theory there is a statistical dependence between two\nregions in spacetime even if they are spacelike separated. A classical\nprobabilistic representation for a family of correlation functions in quantum\nfield theory is obtained. Entangled states in space and time are considered. It\nis shown that any reasonable state in relativistic quantum field theory becomes\ndisentangled (factorizable) at large spacelike distances if one makes local\nobservations. As a result a violation of Bell`s inequalities can be observed\nwithout inconsistency with principles of relativistic quantum theory only if\nthe distance between detectors is rather small. We suggest a further\nexperimental study of entangled states in spacetime by studying the dependence\nof the correlation functions on the distance between detectors.",

The object HCM 6A was found in a narrowband imaging survey using a\n118 Angstrom bandpass filter centered at 9152 Ang in the LRIS camera on the 10\nm Keck II Telescope. Candidate Lyman alpha emitters were identified by the\nequivalent width of the emission and the absence of lower wavelength flux in\nultradeep broadband images. HCM6A is the first galaxy to be confirmed at\nredshift z>6, and has W_lambda(observed)=190 Angstroms, flux = 2.7 x 10^-17 erg\ncm^-2 s^-1. Spectra obtained with LRIS confirm the emission line and the\ncontinuum break across the line, and show an asymmetric line profile with steep\nfall-off on the blue side. Deep Subaru near-infrared CISCO images in J, H and\nK' which extend the sampled continuum to longer wavelengths give a consistent\nestimate of the continuum flux density in these line-free regions of 2.6+/-0.7\nx 10^-30 erg cm^-2 s^-1 Hz^-1. The line width and strength, asymmetric profile,\nand very deep spectral break are only consistent with the interpretation of the\nline as a redshifted Lyman alpha feature. From the detailed lensing model of\nthis cluster, we estimate a lensing amplification of 4.5 for this galaxy, which\nis located slightly over an arcminute from the center of the cluster, for an\nunlensed flux of 6.5 x 10^-18 erg cm^-2 s^-1.

Confirming previous Chandra results, we find that the\nfainter sources have harder X-ray spectra, providing a consistent solution to\nthe long-standing `spectral paradox'. From deep optical and near-infrared\nfollow-up data, 77% of the X-ray sources have optical counterparts to I=24 and\n71% of the X-ray sources have near-infrared counterparts to K=20.

The observed [FeIII] line\nratios are compared with the predictions of different sets of collision\nstrengths and transition probabilities for this ion to select the atomic data\nproviding the best fit to the observations. The values found for the Fe++ and\nFe+ abundances, along with ionization correction factors for the contribution\nof Fe3+, obtained from available grids of photoionized models, imply that the\nFe/O ratio in the ionized gas is between 2% and 30% of solar. The Fe abundances\nderived for each area are correlated both with the degree of ionization and the\ncolour excess. A possible explanation is suggested, namely the presence of a\npopulation of small grains, probably originating from the fragmentation of\nlarger grains. These small grains would release Fe atoms into the gas after the\nabsorption of energetic photons; the small grains surviving this destruction\nprocess would be swept out of the ionized region by the action of radiation\npressure or stellar winds. An indication of a further and more efficient\ndestruction agent is given by the high Fe abundance derived for a position\nsampling the optical jet H399 in M20, where dust destruction due to shock waves\nhas presumably taken place.",

The photonic crystal consisted of\ndielectric cylindrical rods in air placed normal to the basal plane on vertices\nof tiles composing the quasiperiodic pattern. An isotropic photonic band gap\n(PBG) appeared in the TM mode, where electric fields were parallel to the rods,\neven when the real part of a dielectric constant of the rod was as small as\n2.4. An isotropic PBG-like dip was seen in tiny Penrose and octagonal PCs with\nonly 6 and 9 rods, respectively. These results indicate that local multiple\nlight scattering within the tiny PC plays an important role in the PBG\nformation. Besides the isotropic PBG, we found dips depending on the incident\nangle of the light. This is the first report of anisotropic structures clearly\nobserved in transmission spectra of quasiperiodic PCs. Based on rod-number and\nrod-arrangement dependence, it is thought that the shapes and positions of the\nanisotropic dips are determined by global multiple light scattering covering\nthe whole system. In contrast to the isotropic PBG due to local light\nscattering, we could not find any PBGs due to global light scattering even\nthough we studied transmission spectra of a huge Penrose PC with 466 rods.",

We solve the linearized Eliashberg\nequation by taking into account the full momentum-frequency dependence of the\norder parameter for the spin-triplet and the spin-singlet states, and estimate\nthe transition temperature as a function of the Coulomb integrals. The\neffective pairing interaction is expanded perturbatively with respect to the\nCoulomb interaction at the Ru sites up to the third order. As a result, we show\nthat the spin-triplet p-wave state is more stable than the spin-singlet d-wave\nstate for moderately strong Coulomb interaction. Our results suggest that one\nof the three bands, $\\gamma$, plays a dominant role in the superconducting\ntransition, and the pairing on the other two bands($\\alpha$ and $\\beta$) is\ninduced passively through the inter-orbit couplings. The most significant\nmomentum dependence for the p-wave pairing originates from the vertex\ncorrection terms, while the incommensurate antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations,\nwhich are observed in inelastic neutron scattering experiments, are expected to\ndisturb the p-wave pairing by enhancing the d-wave pairing. Therefore we can\nregard the spin-triplet superconductivity in Sr2RuO4 as one of the natural\nresults of the electron correlations, and cannot consider as a result of some\nstrong magnetic fluctuations.

The present paper proposes a qualitative\nmodel for this non-monotonic structure relaxation. We assume that the alloy\nhave crystalline defects which trap (or emit) an additional amount of Er atoms.\nHydrogen atoms into the alloy disturb the phase equilibrium as well as change\nthe defects capacity with respect to Er atoms. Both of these factors lead to\nthe spatial redistribution of Er atoms and cause the interface between the\nEr-rich and the Er-poor phase to move. The competition of diffusion fluxes in\nsystem is responsible for non-monotonic time variations, for example, in the\nrelative volume of the enriched phase. We have found the conditions when the\ninterface motion can change its direction several times during the system\nrelaxation to a new equilibrium state. From our point of view this effect is\nthe essence of the hydrogen induced non-monotonic relaxation observed in such\nsystems. The numerical simulation confirms the basic assumptions.",

Two of the thermal plasma components have\ntemperatures of 0.18+-0.04 keV and 0.64+-0.04 keV, characteristic of the hot\ninterstellar medium produced by supernovae; the combined luminosity of these\ntwo plasma components accounts for all the unresolved bulge X-ray emission seen\nin the Chandra observation by Tennant et al (2001).

This instability is an important issue for most\nmodels of cosmic gamma-ray bursts, where the central engine responsible for the\ninitial energy release is such a system consisting of a thick disc surrounding\na black hole. We have carried out a comprehensive number of time-dependent\nsimulations aimed at exploring the appearance of the instability. Our study has\nbeen performed using a fully relativistic hydrodynamics code. The general\nrelativistic hydrodynamic equations are formulated as a hyperbolic\nflux-conservative system and solved using a suitable Godunov-type scheme. We\nbuild a series of constant angular momentum discs around a Schwarzschild black\nhole. Furthermore, the self-gravity of the disc is neglected and the evolution\nof the central black hole is assumed to be that of a sequence of exact\nSchwarzschild black holes of varying mass. The black hole mass increase is thus\ndetermined by the mass accretion rate across the event horizon. In agreement\nwith previous studies based on stationary models, we find that by allowing the\nmass of the black hole to grow the disc becomes unstable. Our hydrodynamical\nsimulations show that for all disc-to-hole mass ratios considered (between 1\nand 0.05), the runaway instability appears very fast on a dynamical timescale\nof a few orbital periods, typically a few 10 ms and never exceeding 1 s for our\nparticular choice of the mass of the black hole ($2.5 \\mathrm{M_\\odot}$) and a\nlarge range of mass fluxes ($\\dot{m} \\ga 10^{-3} \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}/s}$).

We\npropose a condition for the conformal sigma model to be RCFT for arbitrary\nCalabi-Yau n-folds, which agrees with the known cases. Together with recent\nconjectures by mathematicians it appears that rational conformal theories are\nnot dense in the space of all conformal theories, and sometimes appear to be\nfinite in number for Calabi-Yau n-folds for n>2. RCFT's on K3 may be dense. We\nspeculate about the meaning of these special points in the moduli spaces of\nCalabi-Yau n-folds in connection with freezing geometric moduli.",

Every two\ndisjoint closed subsets of $X$ can be separated by a one-codimensional smooth\nmanifold which is a level set of a smooth function with no critical points;\nthis fact may be viewed as a nonlinear analogue of the geometrical version of\nthe Hahn-Banach theorem.

The `natural' candidate, the bosonic string,\nleads to amplitudes with the usual problems related to the existence of the\ntachyon, absence of the adequate Adler zero, and massless vector particles, not\nto mention the conformal anomaly. The supersymmetric version does not really\nsolve most of these problems. For a long time it has been believed that the\nsolution of at least some of these difficulties is associated to a proper\nidentification of the vacuum, but this program has remained elusive. We show in\nthis work how the first three problems can be avoided, by using a sigma model\napproach where excitations above the correct (chirally non-invariant) QCD\nvacuum are identified. At the leading order in a derivative expansion we\nrecover the non-linear sigma model of pion interactions. At the next-to-leading\norder the O(p^4) Lagrangian of Gasser and Leutwyler is obtained, with values\nfor the coefficients that match the observed values. We also discuss some\nissues related to the conformal anomaly.",

We conclude\nthat if the Peccei-Quinn scale fulfills $F_a < 1.2 \\times 10^{12} \\GeV$ there\nis thermal axion production. In this case, a period in the early universe\nexists where axions interact with the QCD plasma and we point out that\nnon-thermal axions produced before the end of this period will thermalize.

The properties of the\nextended, differentially rotating H I layer with its H I holes, spiral\nstructure and outer warp are described. In addition, these new data reveal the\npresence of a faint, extended and kinematically anomalous component. This shows\nup in the H I line profiles as extended wings of emission towards the systemic\nvelocity. In the central regions these wings are very broad (up to 150 km/s)\nand indicate large deviations from circular motion. We have separated the\nanomalous gas component from the cold disk and have obtained for it a separate\nvelocity field and a separate rotation curve. The mass of the anomalous\ncomponent is 1/10 of the total H I mass. The rotation velocity of the anomalous\ngas is 25-50 km/s lower than that of the disk. Its velocity field has\nnon-orthogonal major and minor axes that we interpret as due to an overall\ninflow motion of 10-20 km/s towards the centre of the galaxy. The picture\nemerging from these observations is that of a cold H I disk surrounded by a\nthick and clumpy H I layer characterized by slower rotation and inflow motion\ntowards the center. The origin of this anomalous gas layer is unclear. It is\nlikely, however, that it is related to the high rate of star formation in the\ndisk of NGC 2403 and that its kinematics is the result of a galactic fountain\ntype of mechanism. We suggest that these anomalous H I complexes may be\nanalogous to a part of the High Velocity Clouds of our Galaxy.",

The evolution of the X-ray luminosity\nfunction of these low luminosity systems is more sensitive to the thermal\nhistory of the intra-group medium (IGM) than to cosmological parameters. Energy\ninjection into the IGM (from for example supernovae or AGN winds) is required\nto explain the X-ray properties of nearby groups.

Although small, this dispersion is several times larger than that\nexpected for a globular cluster of this luminosity and central concentration.\nTaken at face value, this dispersion implies a mass-to-light ratio of ~ 40 (in\nsolar units) based on the best-fit King-Michie model.

The full surface density profile is equally well-fit by a\nKing-Michie model having a high concentration and large tidal radius, or by a\nNFW model. We examine -- and tentatively reject -- a number of possible\nexplanations for the observed characteristics of Palomar 13 (e.g., velocity\n\"jitter\" among the red giants, spectroscopic binary stars, non-standard mass\nfunctions, modified Newtonian dynamics), and conclude that the two most\nplausible scenarios are either catastrophic heating during a recent\nperigalacticon passage, or the presence of a massive dark halo.

    "summary": "In conventional models of galactic and cluster cooling flows widespread\ncooling (mass dropout) is assumed to avoid accumulation of unacceptably large\ncentral masses. However, recent XMM observations have failed to find spectral\nevidence for locally cooling gas. This has revived the notion that cooling\nflows are heated by some process such as an intermittent, low-level AGN\ninvolving supermassive black holes in the central galaxy. To explore this\nhypothesis, we consider the gasdynamical consequences of galactic cooling flows\nheated by many different scenarios without specifying the detailed physics of\nthe heating process. We are unable to find a single acceptable heated flow in\nreasonable agreement with well observed hot gas temperature and density\nprofiles, even using finely tuned parameters. Idealized flows in which\nradiative cooling is perfectly balanced by global heating are grossly\nincompatible with observations. Flows heated by episodic central feedback\ngenerate quasi-cyclic changes in the hot gas density profile which are not\nsupported by current observations. Paradoxically, centrally heated (or\npressurized) cooling flows experience spontaneous non-linear compressions that\nresult in spatially widespread cooling instabilities. Therefore, spectral\nevidence for cooling gas is difficult to avoid by central heating.",

The mode frequencies are\napproximately quantised in analogy to those of a vibrating pipe. The stability\nproperties depend on the cooling processes, the electron-ion energy exchange\nand the boundary conditions. This paper considers the effects of the lower\nboundary condition on the post-shock flow, both ideally and for some specific\nphysical models. Specific cases include constant perturbed velocity, pressure,\ndensity, flow rate, or temperature at the lower boundary, and the situation\nwith nonzero stationary flow velocity at the lower boundary. It is found that\nfor cases with zero terminal stationary velocity, the stability properties are\ninsensitive to the perturbed hydrodynamic variables at the lower boundary. The\nluminosity responses are generally dependent on the lower boundary condition.",

From each simulation, we\nhave generated ray-traced maps of radio surface brightness at a variety of jet\ninclinations, in order to study the appearance of time-dependent luminous\nstructures in the vicinity of the western hot-spot. We compare these rendered\nimages with observed features of Pictor A. A remarkable feature of Pictor A\nobservations is a bar-shaped \"filament\" inclined almost at right angles to the\ninferred jet direction and extending 24\" (10.8 /h kpc) along its longest axis.\nThe constraints of reproducing the appearance of this structure in simulations\nindicate that the jet of Pictor A lies nearly in the plane of the sky. The\nresults of the simulation are also consistent with other features found in the\nradio image of Pictor A. This filament arises from the surging behaviour of the\njet near the hot-spot; the surging is provoked by alternate compression and\ndecompression of the jet by the turbulent backflow in the cocoon. We also\nexamine the arguments for the jet in Pictor A being at a more acute angle to\nthe line of sight and find that our preferred orientation is just consistent\nwith the limits on the brightness ratio of the X-ray jet and counter-jet.

S_{f} and S_{w} together determine a Fenman\nintegral. Hence all Feynman integrals are convergent and it is unnecessary to\nintroduce regularization and counterterms. That the energy of the vacuum state\nis equal to zero is naturally obtained. From this we can easily determine the\ncosmological constant according to data of astronomical observation, and it is\npossible to correct nonperturbational methods which depend on the energy of the\nground state in quantum field theory. On the same basis as the new QED, we\nobtain naturally a new SU(2)XU(1) electroweak unified model whose L=L_{F}+L_{W}\n, here L is left-right symmetric. Thus the world is left-right symmetric in\nprinciple, but the part observed by us is asymmetric because L_{W} and L_{F}\nare all asymmetic. This model do not contain any unknown particle with a\nmassive mass. A conjecture that there is repulsion or gravitation between the\nW-particles and the F-particles is presented.

For variations in initial disk density of a factor of 16,\nvariations of stellar dipole strength of a factor of 4, and for various initial\nconditions with respect to the disk truncation radius and the existence of a\ndisk field, outflows with similar morphologies were consistently produced.\nSecondly, the system is self-regulating, where the outflow properties depend\nrelatively weakly on the parameters above. The large scale magnetic field\nstructure rapidly evolves to a configuration that removes angular momentum from\nthe disk at a rate that depends most strongly on the field and weakly on the\nrotation rate of the foot-points of the field in the disk and the mass outflow\nrate. Third, the simulated jets are episodic, with the timescale of jet\noutbursts identical to the timescale of magnetically induced oscillations of\nthe inner edge of the disk. To better understand the physics controlling these\ndisk oscillations, we present a semi-analytical model and confirm that the\noscillation period is set by the spin down rate of the disk inner edge.\nFinally, our simulations offer strong evidence that it is indeed the\ninteraction of the stellar magnetosphere with the disk, rather than some\nprimordial field in the disk itself, that is responsible for the formation of\njets from these systems.",

The results\nof these model calculations show that a form of the Penrose mechanism is\ncapable of producing the observed high energy particles (up to of order GeV)\nemitted by quasars and other active galactic nuclei (AGNs), without the\nnecessity of the external electromagnetic field of the accretion disk.\nImportantly, these model calculations show that the Lense-Thirring effect,\ni.e., the dragging of inertial frames into rotation, caused by the angular\nmomentum of the rotating black hole, results in a gravitomagnetic (GM) force\nbeing exerted on the scattered escaping particles. Inside the ergosphere, where\nthis dragging is severe, in appears that the GM vector field lines are frame\ndragged into the positive azimuthal direction, i.e., the direction of rotation\nof the black hole. The resulting GM force acting on the Penrose scattered\nparticles produces symmetrical and asymmetrical (or one-sided) particle\nemissions in the polar direction, consistent with the astrophysical jets\nobserved in radio strong AGNs. Note, these Penrose processes can apply to any\nsize rotating black hole.",

Depending on the properties of the phases\nparametrizing the quantization, we consider only two classes of the QMB maps:\nuniform and random. Uniform QMB maps are characterized by phases which are the\nsame in every unit cell of the multibaker chain. Random QMB maps have phases\nthat vary randomly from unit cell to unit cell. The eigenstates in the former\ncase are extended while in the latter they are localized. In the uniform case\nand for large $\\hbar$, analytic solutions can be obtained for the time\ndependent quantum states for periodic chains and for open chains with absorbing\nboundary conditions. Steady state solutions and the properties of the\nrelaxation to a steady state for a uniform QMB chain in contact with\n``particle'' reservoirs can also be described analytically. The analytical\nresults are consistent with, and confirmed by, results obtained from numerical\nmethods. We report here results for the deep quantum regime (large $\\hbar$) of\nthe uniform QMB, as well as some results for the random QMB.

    "summary": "We investigate the photon-trapping effects in the super-critical black hole\naccretion flows by solving radiation transfer as well as the energy equations\nof radiation and gas. It is found that the slim-disk model generally\noverestimates the luminosity of the disk at around the Eddington luminosity\n(L_E) and is not accurate in describing the effective temperature profile,\nsince it neglects time delay between energy generation at deeper inside the\ndisk and energy release at the surface. Especially, the photon-trapping effects\nare appreciable even below L ~ L_E, while they appear above ~ 3L_E according to\nthe slim disk. Through the photon-trapping effects, the luminosity is reduced\nand the effective temperature profile becomes flatter than r^{-3/4} as in the\nstandard disk. In the case that the viscous heating is effective only around\nthe equatorial plane, the luminosity is kept around the Eddington luminosity\neven at very large mass accretion rate, Mdot>>L_E/c^2. The effective\ntemperature profile is almost flat, and the maximum temperature decreases in\naccordance with rise in the mass accretion rate. Thus, the most luminous radius\nshifts to the outer region when Mdot/(L_E/c^2) >> 10^2. In the case that the\nenergy is dissipated equally at any heights, the resultant luminosity is\nsomewhat larger than in the former case, but the energy-conversion efficiency\nstill decreases with increase of the mass accretion rate, as well. The most\nluminous radius stays around the inner edge of the disk in the latter case.\nHence, the effective temperature profile is sensitive to the vertical\ndistribution of energy production rates, so is the spectral shape. Future\nobservations of high L/L_E objects will be able to test our model.",

In a first step we investigate the cloud-cloud collision rate in the\nCircumnuclear Disk (CND) with the help of a three dimensional N-body code using\ngas particles that can have inelastic collisions. The CND might be a longer\nlived structure than previously assumed. The whole disk-like structure of the\nCND can thus survive for several million years. A realistic simulation of the\nCND shows the observed disk height structure. In a second step the environment\nof the CND is taken into account. Retrograde and prograde encounters of a cloud\nof several 10^4 M_solar falling onto an already existing nuclear disk using\ndifferent energy loss rates per collision are simulated. The influence of the\nenergy loss rate per collision on the evolution of the mass accretion and cloud\ncollision rates is strongest for a prograde encounter. A composite data cube of\ntwo different snapshots of a prograde encounter together with the CND shows\nstriking similarity with the observed Sgr A cloud complex. The current\nappearance of the Galactic Centre environment can thus be explained by at least\ntwo dynamically distinct features together with the CND. The current mass\naccretion rate within the CND ranges between 10^-3 and 10^-4 M_solar yr^-1. It\ncan rise up to several 10^-2 M_solar yr^-1 during massive accretion events.",

In order to describe also the space distribution of seismicity, we\nuse in addition a power law distribution ~1/r^{1+\\mu} of distances between\ntriggered and triggering earthquakes. We present an exact mapping between the\nETAS model and a class of CTRW (continuous time random walk) models, based on\nthe identification of their corresponding Master equations. This mapping allows\nus to use the wealth of results previously obtained on anomalous diffusion of\nCTRW. We provide a classification of the different regimes of diffusion of\nseismic activity triggered by a mainshock. Specifically, we derive the relation\nbetween the average distance between aftershocks and the mainshock as a\nfunction of the time from the mainshock and of the joint probability\ndistribution of the times and locations of the aftershocks. Our predictions are\nchecked by careful numerical simulations. We stress the distinction between the\n``bare'' Omori law describing the seismic rate activated directly by a\nmainshock and the ``renormalized'' Omori law taking into account all possible\ncascades from mainshocks to aftershocks of aftershock of aftershock, and so on.\nIn particular, we predict that seismic diffusion or sub-diffusion occurs and\nshould be observable only when the observed Omori exponent is less than 1,\nbecause this signals the operation of the renormalization of the bare Omori\nlaw, also at the origin of seismic diffusion in the ETAS model.",

There are two natural length scales associated with a tube subject to\ncompaction -- the thickness of the tube and the range of the attractive\ninteractions. For short tubes, when these length scales become comparable, one\nobtains marginally compact structures, which are relatively few in number\ncompared to those in the generic compact phase of polymers. The motifs\nassociated with the structures in this new phase include helices, hairpins and\nsheets. We suggest that Nature has selected this phase for the structures of\nproteins because of its many advantages including the few candidate strucures,\nthe ability to squeeze the water out from the hydrophobic core and the\nflexibility and versatility associated with being marginally compact.

Our analysis\nindicates very hot plasma with temperatures up to T=15-20MK from the continuum\nand from ratios of hydrogen-like and helium-like ions of Si, Mg, and Ne. In\naddition lower temperature material is present since OVII and NVI are detected.\nTwo methods for density diagnostics are applied. The He-like triplets from NVII\nto SiXIII are used and densities around 10^11 cm^-3 are found for the low\ntemperature ions. Taking the UV radiation field from the B star companion into\naccount, we find that the low-Z ions can be affected by the radiation field\nquite strongly, such that densities of 3 10^10 cm^-3 are also possible, but\nonly assuming that the emitting plasma is immersed in the radiation field. For\nthe high temperature He-like ions only low density limits are found. Using\nratios of FeXXI lines produced at similar temperatures are sensitive to lower\ndensities but again yield only low density limits. We thus conclude that the\nhot plasma has densities below 10^12 cm^-3. Assuming a constant pressure corona\nwe show that the characteristic loop sizes must be small compared to the\nstellar radius and that filling factors below 0.1 are unlikely.",

It is shown that the formation energy of\nsurface steps depends on the sign of extensional strain of the crystal surface,\nand this behavior plays a crucial role in surface evolution. The nature of this\ndependence implies that there is no energetic barrier to nucleation of islands\non the growth surface during deposition, and that island faces tend toward\nnatural orientations which have no counterpart in unstrained materials. This\nbehavior is expressed in terms of a small number of parameters that can be\nestimated through atomistic analysis of stepped surfaces. The continuum\nframework developed is then applied to study the time evolution of surface\nshape of an epitaxial film being deposited onto a substrate. The kinetic\nequation for mass transport is enforced in a weak form by means of a\nvariational formulation [...].",

    "summary": "We present a study of the irregular dwarf galaxy Holmberg II based on ROSAT\nPSPC observations (total exposure time: 22 ksec). Holmberg II is a nearby (3.2\nMpc), well-studied dwarf irregular galaxy. It is famous for its interstellar\nmedium which is dominated by expanding structures such as HI holes and shells.\nWe search for X-ray emission from point sources as well as for diffuse\nemission, down to the detection limit of the ROSAT data. Using X-ray hardness\nratio diagrams we differentiate between thermal plasma and power-law X-ray\nspectra which helps to determine the nature of the individual sources.\nCorrelating the X-ray data with complementary observations ranging from the\nfar-ultraviolet to the radio regime we increase the probability of correctly\nidentifying sources belonging to Holmberg II. We did not detect soft X-ray\nemission originating from hot gas within supergiant HI shells above our\nluminosity sensitivity limit of (L_limit(0.1 - 2.1 keV) ~ 10^{37}erg/s). This\nfinding can probably be attributed to blow-out in the case of the largest holes\nand insufficient sensitivity (due to strong photoelectric absorption) in case\nof the smaller HI holes. However we find faint X-ray sources well beyond the\nstellar body but within the HI distribution of Holmberg II, which suggests the\npresence of X-ray binaries. This indicates that star formation has taken place\nacross the entire gaseous disk of Holmberg II in the past, some of which may\nhave created the structures seen in the ISM at large galactocentric radii.",

We examine here\nthe electron dynamics in a double quantum well when intense AC electric fields\nF, and tilted magnetic fields are applied simultaneously. The problem is\ntreated non-perturbatively by a time-dependent Hamiltonian in the effective\nmass approximation, and using a Floquet-Fourier formalism. For B_par=0, the\nquasi-energy spectra show two types of crossings: those related to different\nLandau levels, and those associated to dynamic localization (DL), where the\nelectron is confined to one of the wells, despite the non-negligible tunneling\nbetween wells. B_par couples parallel and in-plane motions producing\nanti-crossings in the spectrum. However, since our approach is\nnon-perturbative, we are able to explore the entire frequency range. For high\nfrequencies, we reproduce the well known results of perfect DL given by zeroes\nof a Bessel function. We find also that the system exhibits DL at the same\nvalues of the field F, even as B_par non-zero, suggesting a hidden dynamical\nsymmetry in the system which we identify with different parity operations. The\nreturn times for the electron at various values of field exhibit interesting\nand complex behavior which is also studied in detail. We find that smaller\nfrequencies shifts the DL points to lower field F, and more importantly, yields\npoorer localization by the field. We analyze the explicit time evolution of the\nsystem, monitoring the elapsed time to return to a given well for each Landau\nlevel, and find non-monotonic behavior for decreasing frequencies.",

We conclude here that this result\nis unavoidable, unless the masses are strongly underestimated by reverberation\nstudies, which does not seem to be the case. There are three issues to the\nproblem: 1. Accretion proceeds at Eddington or super-Eddington rates through\nthick discs. Several consequences follow: an anti-correlation between the line\nwidths of the lines and the Eddington ratios, and a decrease of the Eddington\nratio with an increasing black hole mass. Extrapolated to all quasars, these\nresults imply that the amount of mass locked in massive black holes should be\nlarger than presently thought. 2. The optical luminosity is not produced\ndirectly by the gravitational release of energy, and super-Eddington rates are\nnot required. The optical luminosity has to be emitted by a dense and thick\nmedium located at large distances from the center (10$^3$ to $10^4$\ngravitational radii). It can be due to reprocessing of the X-ray photons from\nthe central source in a geometrically thin warped disc, or in dense \"blobs\"\nforming a geometrically thick system, which can be a part of the accretion flow\nor the basis of an outflow. 3. Accretion discs are completely \"non standard\".\nPresently neither the predictions of models nor the observed spectral\ndistributions are sufficient to help choosing between these solutions.",

All of the clusters which are most probably\nassociated with EGRET sources show evidence of strong radio emission either\nbecause they host radio galaxies/sources in their environments or because they\nhave a radio halo or relic inhabiting their intracluster medium. The cluster\nradio emission suggests that the relativistic particles (electrons, protons),\nwhich are diffusing in the intracluster medium, might be also responsible for\ntheir gamma-ray emission. Beyond the spatial associations of clusters with\nunidentified EGRET sources, we found a correlation between the radio flux at\n1.4 GHz of the cluster's brightest source and the gamma-ray flux, F(>100 MeV),\nof the associated EGRET source. For the most probable EGRET-cluster\nassociations we also found a further correlation between the X-ray luminosity\nof galaxy clusters and the gamma-ray luminosity of the associated gamma-ray\nsource under the hypothesis that the EGRET sources have the same cluster\nredshifts.

    "summary": "This work is an enquiry into the circumstances under which entropy methods\ncan give an answer to the questions of both quantum separability and classical\ncorrelations of a composite state. Several entropy functionals are employed to\nexamine the entanglement and correlation properties guided by the corresponding\ncalculations of concurrence. It is shown that the entropy difference between\nthat of the composite and its marginal density matrices may be of arbitrary\nsign except under special circumstances when conditional probability can be\ndefined appropriately. This ambiguity is a consequence of the fact that the\noverlap matrix elements of the eigenstates of the composite density matrix with\nthose of its marginal density matrices also play important roles in the\ndefinitions of probabilities and the associated entropies, along with their\nrespective eigenvalues. The general results are illustrated using pure and\nmixed state density matrices of two-qubit systems. Two classes of density\nmatrices are found for which the conditional probability can defined: (1)\ndensity matrices with commuting decompositions and (2) those which are\ndecohered in the representation where the density matrices of the marginals are\ndiagonal. The first class of states encompass those whose separability is\ncurrently understood as due to particular symmetries of the states. The second\nare a new class of states which are expected to be useful for understanding\nseparability. Examples of entropy functionals of these decohered states\nincluding the crucial isospectral case are discussed.",

We explain the high luminosity and\ntemperature of the diffuse X-ray emission from this system as the result of\nshock-heating of intracluster gas by the merger of two galaxy groups. Taken\ntogether with the results on other well-studied powerful radio sources, we\nsuggest that the key ingredient for triggering a powerful radio source, at\nleast at epochs corresponding to z~1, is a galaxy--galaxy interaction which can\nbe orchestrated by the merger of their parent subclusters. This provides an\nexplanation for the rapid decline in the number density of powerful radio\nsources since z~1. We argue that attempts to use distant radio-selected\nclusters to trace the formation and evolution of the general cluster population\nmust address ways in which X-ray properties can be influenced by the radio\nsource, both directly, by mechanisms such as inverse-Compton scattering, and\nindirectly, by the fact that the radio source may be preferentially triggered\nat a specific time during the formation of the cluster.",

Absorption from this\nhot H I can be detected in high resolution Lyman-alpha spectra of these stars\nfrom the Hubble Space Telescope. The amount of absorption can be used as a\ndiagnostic for the stellar mass loss rate. We present new mass loss rate\nmeasurements derived in this fashion for four stars (Epsilon Eri, 61 Cyg A, 36\nOph AB, and 40 Eri A). Combining these measurements with others, we study how\nmass loss varies with stellar activity. We find that for the solar-like GK\ndwarfs, the mass loss per unit surface area is correlated with X-ray surface\nflux. Fitting a power law to this relation yields Mdot ~ Fx^(1.15+/-0.20). The\nactive M dwarf Proxima Cen and the very active RS CVn system Lambda And appear\nto be inconsistent with this relation. Since activity is known to decrease with\nage, the above power law relation for solar-like stars suggests that mass loss\ndecreases with time. We infer a power law relation of Mdot ~ t^(-2.00+/-0.52).\nThis suggests that the solar wind may have been as much as 1000 times more\nmassive in the distant past, which may have had important ramifications for the\nhistory of planetary atmospheres in our solar system, that of Mars in\nparticular.",

More astrophysically realistic initial data will require\nmore careful choices of the freely specifiable data and boundary conditions for\nboth the metric and extrinsic curvature. However, we find that the choice of\nextrinsic curvature affects the resulting data sets more strongly than the\nchoice of conformal metric.",

Unlike pure pentacene, the functionalized derivatives\nare readily soluble in acetone, and can be evaporated or spin-cast as thin\nfilms for potential device applications. The electrical conductivity of the\nsingle crystal materials is noticeably sensitive to ambient light changes. The\npurpose, therefore, of the present study, is to determine the nature of the\nphoto-response in terms of carrier activation vs. heating effects, and also to\nmeasure the dependence of the photo-response on photon energy. We describe a\nnew method, involving the temperature dependent photo-response, which allows an\nunambiguous identification of the signature of heating effects in materials\nwith a thermally activated conductivity. We find strong evidence that the\nphoto-response in the materials investigated is predominantly a highly\nlocalized heating mechanism. Wavelength dependent studies of the photo-response\nreveal resonant features and cut-offs that indicate the photon energy\nabsorption is related to the electronic structure of the material.",

    "summary": "We study eccentric equatorial orbits of a test-body around a Kerr black hole\nunder the influence of gravitational radiation reaction. We have adopted a well\nestablished two-step approach: assuming that the particle is moving along a\ngeodesic (justifiable as long as the orbital evolution is adiabatic) we\ncalculate numerically the fluxes of energy and angular momentum radiated to\ninfinity and to the black hole horizon, via the Teukolsky-Sasaki-Nakamura\nformalism. We can then infer the rate of change of orbital energy and angular\nmomentum and thus the evolution of the orbit. The orbits are fully described by\na semi-latus rectum $p$ and an eccentricity $e$. We find that while, during the\ninspiral, $e$ decreases until shortly before the orbit reaches the separatrix\nof stable bound orbits (which is defined by $p_{s}(e)$), in many\nastrophysically relevant cases the eccentricity will still be significant in\nthe last stages of the inspiral. In addition, when a critical value\n$p_{crit}(e)$ is reached, the eccentricity begins to increase as a result of\ncontinued radiation induced inspiral. The two values $p_{s}$, $p_{crit}$ (for\ngiven $e$) move closer to each other, in coordinate terms, as the black hole\nspin is increased, as they do also for fixed spin and increasing eccentricity.\nOf particular interest are moderate and high eccentricity orbits around rapidly\nspinning black holes, with $p(e) \\approx p_{s}(e)$. We call these\n``zoom-whirl'' orbits, because of their characteristic behaviour involving\nseveral revolutions around the central body near periastron. Gravitational\nwaveforms produced by such orbits are calculated and shown to have a very\nparticular signature. Such signals may well prove of considerable astrophysical\nimportance for the future LISA detector.",

    "summary": "An improved numerical solver for the unified solution of compressible and\nincompressible fluids involving interfaces is proposed. The present method is\nbased on the CIP-CUP (Cubic Interpolated Propagation / Combined, Unified\nProcedure) method, which is a pressure-based semi-implicit solver for the Euler\nequations of fluid flows. In Part I of this series of articles [M. Ida, Comput.\nPhys. Commun. 132 (2000) 44], we proposed an improved scheme for the convection\nterms in the equations, which allowed us discontinuous descriptions of the\ndensity interface by replacing the cubic interpolation function used in the CIP\nscheme with a quadratic extrapolation function only around the interface. In\nthis paper, as Part II of this series, the multi-time-step integration\ntechnique is adapted to the CIP-CUP integration. Because the CIP-CUP treats\ndifferent-nature components in the fluid equations separately, the adaptation\nof the technique is straightforward. This modification allows us flexible\ndeterminations of the time interval, which results in an efficient and accurate\nintegration. Furthermore, some additional discussion on our methods is\npresented. Finally, the application results to composite flow problems such as\ncompressible and incompressible Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities and the dynamics\nof two acoustically coupled deformable bubbles in a viscous liquid are\nprovided.",

For\nthe hadronic phase we consider Walecka-type mean-field models which describe\nwell the nuclear saturation properties. We also use the variational chain model\nwhich takes into account correlation effects. For the quark phase we consider\nthe MIT bag model, the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio and the massive quasiparticle models.\nBy comparing pressure as a function of baryon chemical potential we find that\ncrossings of hadronic and quark branches are possible only in some exceptional\ncases while for most realistic parameter sets these branches do not cross at\nall. Moreover, the chiral phase transition, often discussed within the\nframework of QCD motivated models, lies in the region where the quark phases\nare unstable with respect to the hadronic phase. We discuss possible physical\nconsequences of these findings.",

If this occurs for an anomaly-free symmetry, the effective action is\ninvariant under a transformation that differs from its classical counterpart by\nquantum corrections. As shown by Fradkin and Palchik years ago, such a\nphenomenon occurs for conformal symmetry in quantum Yang-Mills theories with\nvanishing beta function, such as the N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory. More\nrecently, Jevicki et al demonstrated that the quantum metamorphosis of\nconformal symmetry sheds light on the nature of the AdS/CFT correspondence. In\nthis paper, we derive the conformal Ward identity for the bosonic sector of the\nN = 4 super Yang-Mills theory using the background field method. We then\ncompute the leading quantum modification of the conformal transformation for a\nspecific Abelian background which is of interest in the context of the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence. In the case of scalar fields, our final result agrees with that\nof Jevicki et al. The resulting vector and scalar transformations coincide with\nthose which are characteristic of a D3-brane embedded in AdS5 x S5.",

This poses fundamental problems for string theory,\nsince a scattering matrix is not well defined in such Universes. In a previous\npaper we have presented a model, based on (non-equilibrium) non-critical\nstrings, which is characterized by eventual ``graceful'' exit from a de Sitter\nphase. The model is based on a type-0 string theory, involving D3 brane worlds,\nwhose initial quantum fluctuations induce the non criticality. We argue in this\narticle that this model is compatible with the current observations. A crucial\nr\\^ole for the correct ``phenomenology'' of the model is played by the relative\nmagnitude of the flux of the five form of the type 0 string to the size of five\nof the extra dimensions, transverse to the direction of the flux-field. We do\nnot claim, at this stage at least, that this model is a realistic physical\nmodel for the Universe, but we find it interesting that the model cannot be\nruled out immediately, at least on phenomenological grounds.",

Two of the three stars are multiperiodic.\nTwo stars have inferred masses of about 10 Mo while the third is about 2 mag\nbrighter and at least twice as massive.

This would reconcile our finding with theoretical predictions of\nthe shape and location of the Beta Cephei instability strip in the H-R diagram.\nThe low number of Beta Cephei stars found in the LMC is another observational\nconfirmation of strong dependence of the mechanism driving pulsations in these\nvariables on metallicity.

    "summary": "We discuss the lift of certain D6-antiD6-brane systems to M-theory. These are\npurely gravitational configurations with a bolt singularity. When reduced along\na trivial circle, and for large bolt radius, the bolt is related to a\nnon-supersymmetric orbifold type of singularity where some closed string\ntachyons are expected in the twisted sectors. This is a kind of open-closed\nstring duality that relates open string tachyons on one side and localised\ntachyons in the other. We consider the evolution of the system of branes from\nM-theory point of view. This evolution gives rise to a brane-antibrane\nannihilation on the brane side. On the gravity side, the evolution is related\nto a reduction of the order of the orbifold and to a contraction of the bolt to\na nut or flat space if the system has non-vanishing or vanishing charge,\nrespectively. We also consider the inverse process of reducing a\nnon-supersymmetric orbifold to a D6-brane system. For $C^2/Z_N\\times Z_M$, the\nreduced system is a fractional D6-brane at an orbifold singularity $C/Z_M$.",

The minority occupied bands accommodate a total of nine electrons\nand the total magnetic moment per unit cell in mu_B is just the difference\nbetween Z_t and $2 \\times 9$. While the substitution of the transition metal\natoms may preserve the half-ferromagnetic character, substituting the $sp$ atom\nresults in a practically rigid shift of the bands and the loss of\nhalf-metallicity. Finally we show that expanding or contracting the lattice\nparameter by 2% preserves the minority-spin gap.",

We find CS31082-001 to be\nextremely rich in r-process elements, comparable in this respect only to the\nsimilarly metal-poor, but carbon-enriched, giant CS22892-052. As a result of\nthe extreme overabundance of the heaviest r-process elements, and negligible\nblending from CH and CN molecular lines, a reliable measurement is obtained of\nthe U II line at 386 nm, for the first time in a halo star, along with numerous\nlines of Th II, as well as lines of 25 other r-process elements. Abundance\nestimates for a total of 43 elements are reported in CS31082-001, almost half\nof the entire periodic table. All elements with 56 \\leq Z \\leq 72 follow the\nSolar r-element pattern, reduced by about 1.25 dex ([r/Fe]=+1.7 dex, a factor\n50). Pb, in contrast, seems to be below the shifted Solar r-process\ndistribution, possibly indicating an error in the latter, while thorium is more\nenhanced than the lighter nuclides. Thus, while a universal production ratio\nfor the r-process elements seems to hold in the interval 56 \\leq Z \\leq 72, it\nbreaks down in the actinide region. When available, the U/Th is thus preferable\nto Th/Eu for radioactive dating: (i) because of its faster decay rate and\nsmaller sensitivity to observational errors, and (ii) because the inital\nproduction ratio of the neighboring nuclides 238U and 232Th is more robustly\npredicted than the 151Eu/232Th ratio. Our current best estimate for the age of\nCS31082-001 is 14.0+/-2.4 Gyr.",

In the absence of systematic\nerrors in the detector point spread function, the extended emission comprises\n<~ 50% of the observed flux in the 0.2-2.0 keV band, for a luminosity of <~\n3e32 erg/s. The spectrum is well modelled by a dominant blackbody with T =\n8.0e5 +/- 3e4 K and a size of 22.5 +/- 2.1 km in addition to a harder component\nthat is modelled as a hotter and much smaller blackbody. No significant\nabsorption features are found in the spectrum that might be expected from\nionization edges of H or He or bound-bound transitions of Fe in magnetized\natmospheres. Such features are expected to be deep but could vary in position\nor strength with rotation phase. There are no strong absorption features in the\npulse-phased spectra, however, so we conclude that the atmosphere is not\ndominated by Fe or other heavy elements that would be partially ionized at a\ntemperature of 1e6 K.",

As a step\nof the presented machinery, a proof of the almost-everywhere smoothness of the\nLorentzian distance considered as a function of one of the two arguments is\ngiven. Afterwards, using a $C^*$-algebra approach, the spacetime causal\nstructure and the Lorentzian distance are generalized into noncommutative\nstructures giving rise to a Lorentzian version of part of Connes'\nnoncommutative geometry. The generalized noncommutative spacetime consists of a\ndirect set of Hilbert spaces and a related class of $C^*$-algebras of\noperators. In each algebra a convex cone made of self-adjoint elements is\nselected which generalizes the class of causal functions. The generalized\nevents, called {\\em loci}, are realized as the elements of the inductive limit\nof the spaces of the algebraic states on the $C^*$-algebras. A partial-ordering\nrelation between pairs of loci generalizes the causal order relation in\nspacetime. A generalized Lorentz distance of loci is defined by means of a\nclass of densely-defined operators which play the r\\^ole of a Lorentzian\nmetric. Specializing back the formalism to the usual globally hyperbolic\nspacetime, it is found that compactly-supported probability measures give rise\nto a non-pointwise extension of the concept of events.",

Using these tree level masses and introducing\nexotic scalars, the light families of charged fermions acquire hierarchical\nmasses through radiative corrections. The rank three mass matrices obtained are\nwritten in terms of a minimal set of free parameters in order to estimate their\nvalues by a numerical fit performance.\n  The resulting masses and CKM mixing angles turn out to be in good agreement\nwith the known values.\n  The new exotic scalar fields mediate flavor changing processes and contribute\nto the anomalous magnetic moments of fermions, additionaly branching ratios an$\nmagnetic moments contributions were evaluated for leptons.",

The\nresulting effective density is built from local chiralities studied previously.\nAt every order of the expansion the density exactly sums up to the global\ntopological charge, and the leading term describes the maximally smooth\nspace-time distribution of charge relevant for propagating light fermions. We\nuse this framework to demonstrate our previous suggestion that the bulk of\ntopological charge in QCD does not effectively appear in the form of quantized\nunit lumps. Our conclusion implies that it is unlikely that the mixing of\n\"would-be\" zeromodes associated with such lumps is the prevalent microscopic\nmechanism for spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in QCD. We also present\nfirst results quantitatively characterizing the space-time behavior of\neffective densities. For coherent fluctuations contained in spherical regions\nwe find a continuous distribution of associated charges essentially ending at\n~0.5.",

Merritt & Ferrarese\nhave argued that low slopes (<4) arise because of neglect of random measurement\nerrors in the dispersions and an incorrect choice for the dispersion of the\nMilky Way Galaxy. We show that these explanations account for at most a small\npart of the slope range. Instead, the range of slopes arises mostly because of\nsystematic differences in the velocity dispersions used by different groups for\nthe same galaxies. The origin of these differences remains unclear, but we\nsuggest that one significant component of the difference results from Ferrarese\n& Merritt's extrapolation of central velocity dispersions to r_e/8 (r_e is the\neffective radius) using an empirical formula. Another component may arise from\ndispersion-dependent systematic errors in the measurements. A new determination\nof the slope using 31 galaxies yields b=4.02 +/- 0.32, a=8.13 +/- 0.06, for\nsigma_0=200 km/s.

The evaluation or at least stochastic\nestimation of ratios of fermionic determinants is essential for a recently\nproposed updating method of smeared link dynamical fermions. This update\ncreates a sequence of configurations by changing a subset of the gauge links by\na pure gauge heat bath or over relaxation step. The acceptance of the proposed\nconfiguration depends on the ratio of the fermionic determinants on the new and\noriginal configurations. We study this ratio as the function of the number of\nlinks that are changed in the heat bath update. We find that even when every\nlink of a given direction and parity of a 10fm^4 configuration is updated, the\naverage of the determinant ratio is still close to one and with the improved\nstochastic estimator the proposed change is accepted with about 20%\nprobability. This improvement suggests that the new updating technique can be\nefficient even on large lattices.",

The bulge velocity dispersion, typically\ndefined within an aperture of size less than 0.5 kpc, is found to correlate\ntightly with the galaxy's circular velocity, the latter measured at distances\nfrom the galactic center at which the rotation curve is flat, 20 to 80kpc. By\nusing the well known M-sigma relation for SBHs, and a prescription to relate\nthe circular velocity to the mass of the dark matter halo in a standard CDM\ncosmology, the correlation between velocity dispersion and circular velocity is\nequivalent to one between SBH and halo masses. Such a correlation is found to\nbe nonlinear, with the ratio between the two masses decreasing from 2X10^-4 for\nhalos of 10^14 solar masses, to 10^-5 for halos of 10^12 solar masses.\nPreliminary evidence suggests that halos smaller than ~5X10^11 solar masses are\nincreasingly less efficient -- perhaps unable -- at forming SBHs.",

Actually,\nthe system contains two waves with a strong linear coupling between them, to\nwhich a third wave is then coupled. This model has two gaps in its linear\nspectrum. Realizations of this model can be made in terms of temporal or\nspatial evolution of optical fields in, respectively, a planar waveguide or a\nbulk-layered medium resembling a photonic-crystal fiber. Another physical\nsystem described by the same model is a set of three internal wave modes in a\ndensity-stratified fluid. A nonlinear analysis is performed for solitons which\nhave zero velocity in the reference frame in which the group velocity of the\nthird wave vanishes. Disregarding the self-phase modulation (SPM) term in the\nequation for the third wave, we find two coexisting families of solitons:\nregular ones, which may be regarded as a smooth deformation of the usual gap\nsolitons in a two-wave system, and cuspons with a singularity in the first\nderivative at their center. Even in the limit when the linear coupling of the\nthird wave to the first two vanishes, the soliton family remains drastically\ndifferent from that in the linearly uncoupled system; in this limit, regular\nsolitons whose amplitude exceeds a certain critical value are replaced by\npeakons. While the regular solitons, cuspons, and peakons are found in an exact\nanalytical form, their stability is tested numerically, which shows that they\nall may be stable.

The distribution of line\nluminosity L_{H\\beta} of all these BL Lac objects suggests a bimodal nature,\nalthough this cannot be statistically proven on the basis of the present,\nrather small sample. We found that standard thin disks are probably in the\nsources with L_{H\\beta}>10^{41} erg s^{-1}. The central black holes in these\nsources have masses of 10^{8-10} M_\\odot, if the matter is accreting at the\nrate of 0.025 {\\dot M}_{\\rm Edd}. For the sources with L_{H\\beta}<10^{41} erg\ns^{-1}, the accretion flows have transited from standard thin disk type to the\nADAF type. The lower limits on the mass of the black hole in these sources are\nin the range of 1.66-24.5\\times 10^{8} M_\\odot. The results support the\nevolutionary sequence of blazars: FSRQ\\to LBL\\to HBL.",

Then we\npropose an experimental method, called TPD (Tradeoff between Performance and\nDifference), to decide when to update the sequential patterns of stream data by\nmaking a tradeoff between the performance of increasingly updating algorithms\nand the difference of sequential patterns. The experiments for the incremental\nupdating algorithm IUS on two data sets show that generally, as the size of\nincremental windows grows, the values of the speedup and the values of the\ndifference will decrease and increase respectively. It is also shown\nexperimentally that the incremental ratio determined by the TPD method does not\nmonotonically increase or decrease but changes in a range between 20 and 30\npercentage for the IUS algorithm.",

The\nspatial distribution of $N$ particles is studied and it is described by use of\nthe probability density function of eigenvalues of $N \\times N$ Gaussian random\nmatrices. The particle distribution depends on the ratio of the observation\ntime $t$ and the time interval $T$ in which the nonintersecting condition is\nimposed. As $t/T$ is going on from 0 to 1, there occurs a transition of\ndistribution, which is identified with the transition observed in the\ntwo-matrix model of Pandey and Mehta. Despite of the absence of matrix\nstructure in the original vicious walker model, in the diffusion scaling limit,\naccumulation of contact repulsive interactions realizes the correlated\ndistribution of eigenvalues in the multimatrix model as the particle\ndistribution.",

First of all, the mixing among the second and the third family\nsleptons can contribute at one loop level to the a_mu(SUSY) and tau -> mu gamma\nsimultaneously. One finds that the a_mu(SUSY) can be as large as (10-20)*10^-10\nfor any tan beta, imposing the upper limit on the tau -> mu gamma branching\nratio. Furthermore, the two-loop Barr-Zee type contributions to a_mu(SUSY) can\nbe significant for large tan beta, if a stop is light and mu and A_t are large\nenough (O(1) TeV). In this case, it is possible to have a_mu(SUSY) upto\nO(10)*10^-10 without conflicting with tau -> l gamma. We conclude that the\npossible maximal value for a_mu(SUSY) is about 20*10^-10 for any tan beta.\nTherefore the BNL experiment on the muon a_mu can exclude the effective SUSY\nmodels only if the measured deviation is larger than \\sim 30*10^-10.",

    "summary": "Higher order renormalization in 4D quantum gravity is carried out using\ndimensional regularization with great care concerning the conformal-mode\ndependence. In this regularization, resummation can be automatically carried\nout without making an assumption like that of David, Distler and Kawai. In this\npaper we consider a model of 4D quantum gravity coupled to QED. Resummation\ninevitably implies a four-derivative quantum gravity. The renormalizability is\ndirectly checked up to $O(e_r^6)$ and $O(t_r^2)$, where $e_r$ and $t_r$ are the\nrunning coupling constants of QED and the traceless gravitational mode. There\nis no other running coupling constant in our model. The conformal mode is\ntreated exactly, which means it is unrenormalized. It is found that Hathrell's\nresults are included in our results. As a by-product, it is found that a\nhigher-order gravitational correction to the beta function of QED is negative.\nAn advantage of our model is that in the very high-energy regime, it closely\nresembles exactly solvable 2D quantum gravity. Thus, we can study physical\nstates of 4D quantum gravity in this regime in parallel to those of 2D quantum\ngravity, which can be described with diffeomorphism invariant composite fields.",

The variable-phase technique, which examines the\nphase jumps near the times of minimum amplitude of an assumed single frequency,\nis applied to the extensive data of the star BI CMi, which shows some of the\nmost extreme behavior. The following results are found for the 5 features in\nthe power spectrum which could be explained as single modes with variable\namplitudes or as double modes: for three features it can be shown that these\nare indeed pairs of separate pulsation modes beating with each other: at times\nof minimum amplitude the phase jumps are observed and both the observed\namplitude and phase variations can be predicted correctly by assuming two\nseparate modes of nearly equal frequencies. Artifacts caused by observational\nerror,insufficient frequency resolution or variable amplitudes can be ruled\nout. A fourth pair has a probable origin in two excited modes, while a 5th case\nis inconclusive due to long time scales of variability and small amplitudes.The\nexistence of close frequencies need to be taken into account in planning the\nlengths of earth-based as well as space campaigns so that sufficient frequency\nresolution is obtained.

    "summary": "We have investigated multiple scattering of light in systems subject to\nmagneto-chiral (MC) effects. Our medium consists of magneto-optically active\ndipoles placed in a chiral geometry under the influence of an external magnetic\nfield. We have calculated, for the first time, the total and the differential\nscattering MC cross sections of this system, explicitely showing that they are\nproportional to pseudoscalar quantities. This provides a new optical measure\nfor the degree of chirality, a pseudoscalar g, of an arbitrary geometrical\nconfiguration of scatterers based on its scattering properties. We have\ncalculated g for some simple chiral systems and we have even used it to probe\nthe degree of optical chirality of random systems. Finally, we have compared\n$g$ with other recently defined chiral measures in literature.",

The presence of a large number of combination frequencies (linear\nsums or differences of the real modes) enabled us not only to test theoretical\npredictions but also to indirectly infer spherical and azimuthal degrees of\nreal modes that had no observed splittings. In addition to the above, we\nmeasure line-of-sight velocities from our spectra.

We find that for a variety of protoplanet\nmasses and typical protoplanetary disc properties, as well as the setting up of\n2:1 commensurabilities of the type recently observed in GJ876, 3:1\ncommensurabilities are often formed, in addition to 4:1, 5:1, and 5:2\ncommensurabilities which occur less frequently. The higher order\ncommensurabilites are favoured when either one of the planets is massive, or\nthe inner planet begins with a significant orbital eccentricity. Detection of\nsuch commensurabilities could yield important information relating to the\noperation of protoplanet disc interactions during and shortly post formation.",

This yields a considerable\nsimplification over the unrestricted case, in which the number of states per\nsite is unbounded. Two toppling rules are considered: in one, the particles are\nredistributed independently, while the other involves some cooperativity. We\nstudy the fixed-energy system (no input or loss of particles) using cluster\napproximations and extensive simulations, and find that it exhibits a\ncontinuous phase transition to an absorbing state at a critical value zeta_c of\nthe particle density.

The only new element is the inclusion of anisotropy in the energy flux\nfrom the pulsar in the theory. In the standard theory of relativistic winds,\nthe Lorentz factor of the particles in front of the shock that terminates the\npulsar relativistic wind depends on the polar angle as\n$\\gamma=\\gamma_0+\\gamma_m\\sin^2\\theta$, where $\\gamma_0 \\sim 200$ and $\\gamma_m\n\\sim 4.5\\times 10^6$. The plasma flow in the wind is isotropic. After the\npassage of the pulsar wind through the shock, the flow becomes subsonic with a\nroughly constant (over the plerion volume) pressure $P={1\\over 3}n\\epsilon$,\nwhere $n$ is the plasma particle density and $\\epsilon$ is the mean particle\nenergy. Since $\\epsilon \\sim \\gamma mc^2$, a low-density region filled with the\nmost energetic electrons is formed near the equator. A bright torus of\nsynchrotron radiation develops here. Jet-like regions are formed along the\npulsar rotation axis, where the particle density is almost four orders of\nmagnitude higher than that in the equatorial plane, because the particle energy\nthere is four orders of magnitude lower. The energy of these particles is too\nlow to produce detectable synchrotron radiation. However, these quasi-jets\nbecome comparable in brightness to the torus if additional particle\nacceleration takes place in the plerion. We also present the results of our\nstudy of the hydrodynamic interaction between an anisotropic wind and the\ninterstellar medium. We compare the calculated and observed distributions of\nthe volume intensity of X-ray radiation.",

At a\n$4\\sigma$ detection level 224 sources over a flux of 0.88 Jy are detected with\na mean relative error (in absolute value) of 21% and a systematic bias of\n-7.7%. The position of the sources in the sky is determined with errors\ninferior to the size of the pixel. The catalogue of detected sources is\ncomplete at fluxes $\\geq$ 4.3 Jy. The number of spurious detections is less\nthan a 10% of the true detections. We compared the results with the ones\nobtained by filtering with a Gaussian filter and a Mexican Hat Wavelet of width\nequal to the scale of the sources. The adaptive filter outperforms the other\nfilters in all considered cases. We conclude that optimal adaptive filters are\nwell suited to detect and extract sources with a given profile embedded in a\nbackground of known statistical properties. In the Planck case, they could be\nuseful to obtain a real-time preliminary catalogue of extragalactic sources,\nwhich would have a great scientific interest, e. g. for follow-up observations.",

The local environments, X-ray spectral\nproperties, and X-ray light curves of the sources are presented and discussed\nin the context of prevailing physical models for supersoft sources. It is shown\nthat the sample falls within expectations based on population synthesis models\ntaken from the literature though the high observed luminosities (L~2.0e36 to\n\\~3.0e38 erg/s in the 0.2-2.0 keV band) and equivalent blackbody temperatures\nT~40 to 80 eV) place the brightest detected M81 objects at the high luminosity\nend of the class of supersoft sources defined by previous ROSAT and Einstein\nstudies of nearby galaxies. This is interpreted as a natural consequence of the\nhigher sensitivity of Chandra to hotter and more luminous systems. Most of the\nsources can be explained as canonical \\ssss, accreting white dwarfs powered by\nsteady surface nuclear burning, with X-ray spectra well-fit by hot white dwarf\nlocal thermodynamic equilibrium atmosphere models. An exceptionally bright\nsource is scrutinized in greater detail as its estimated bolometric luminosity,\nL~1.5e39 erg/s, greatly exceeds theoretical estimates for supersoft sources.\nThis source may be beyond the stability limit and undergoing a phase of mass\noutflow under extreme conditions. Alternatively, a model in which the observed\nX-ray spectrum arises from an accretion disk around a blackhole of mass\n\\~1200/sqrt(cos(i)) solar masses (viewed at an inclination angle i) cannot be\nexcluded.",

This scenario accounts\nremarkably well for the observed properties of galactic disks if they have\nretained most of the specific angular momentum they acquired by tidal torques.\nEarly simulations, which included cooling of the gas but not star formation and\nthe associated feedback, indicated instead that most of the angular momentum of\nthe baryons would be transferred to the dark matter. Recent simulations\nindicate that this angular-momentum problem can be solved partially, and in\nsome cases entirely, by feedback and other effects.",

A significant fraction of the HII regions shows H-alpha luminosities\nabove that of 30 Doradus, the prototypical giant HII region. The excess of\nextremely luminous HII regions in LIRGs has been confirmed by comparison with\nnormal galaxies observed at similar spatial resolutions. Despite the large\nnumbers of identified star clusters and HII regions in LIRGs, we only find a\nsmall fraction of coincidences, between 4% and 30%. Using synthesis models we\nhave reproduced the relative fractions of young HII regions, intermediate and\nold star clusters observed in Arp299 and the central region NGC3256 using a\nSalpeter IMF and instantaneous star formation. HII regions with no detected\nnear-infrared cluster counterpart (25-39%) represent the youngest sites of star\nformation, with ages of up to approximately 5Myr and mostly intermediate mass\n(~10^5Msun) ionizing clusters. For these two galaxies, and within the present\ndetection threshold we can only detect coincidences (4-10%) between an HII\nregion and a near-infrared star cluster for the most massive star clusters\n(~10^6Msun) during the first 7Myr of their evolution. The identified\nnear-infrared SSCs with no detectable Pa-alpha emission represent the ``old''\npopulation (53-66% of the detected sources), with ages of between 7 and\n20-40Myr. Older clusters possibly created in this or previous episodes of star\nformation are likely to exist in these systems but cannot be identified with\nthe present detection threshold. (Abridged)",

    "summary": "We use the technique of wavelet analysis to quantitatively investigate the\nrole of solar variability in forcing terrestrial climate change on solar cycle\ntimescales (roughly 11 years). We examine the connection between mean annual\nsolar irradiance, as reconstructed from sunspot and isotope records, and the\nclimate, as proxied by two Northern Hemisphere surface air temperature\nreconstructions. By applying wavelet transforms to these signals, we are able\nto analyze both the frequency content of each signal, and also the time\ndependence of that content. After computing wavelet transforms of the data, we\nperform correlation analyses on the wavelet transforms of irradiance and\ntemperature via two techniques: the Pearson's method and the conditional\nprobability method. We thus track the correlation between individual frequency\ncomponents of both signals as a function of time. A nonzero correlation between\nthe irradiance and temperature wavelet spectra requires a phase lag between the\ntwo data sets (i.e., terrestrial response to solar output is not\ninstantaneous). We search for the optimal phase lag that maximizes the\ncorrelation. By choosing an appropriate phase for each year, we find a\nsignificant, positive sun-climate correlation for most of the period AD\n1720-1950. We find that this phase-optimized correlation varies in time,\noscillating between 0.12 and 0.71 throughout the past 400 years. We find that\nthe phase lag varies from 0-10 years. We also present a test to determine\nwhether terrestrial response to solar output is enhanced via stochastic\nresonance, wherein the weak periodic solar signal is amplified by terrestrial\nnoise.",

    "summary": "We review certain emergent notions on the nature of spacetime from\nnoncommutative geometry and their radical implications. These ideas of\nspacetime are suggested from developments in fuzzy physics, string theory, and\ndeformation quantisation. The review focuses on the ideas coming from fuzzy\nphysics. We find models of quantum spacetime like fuzzy $S^4$ on which states\ncannot be localised, but which fluctuate into other manifolds like $ CP^3$ .\nNew uncertainty principles concerning such lack of localisability on quantum\nspacetimes are formulated.Such investigations show the possibility of\nformulating and answering questions like the probabilty of finding a point of a\nquantum manifold in a state localised on another one. Additional striking\npossibilities indicated by these developments is the (generic) failure of $CPT$\ntheorem and the conventional spin-statistics connection. They even suggest that\nPlanck's `` constant '' may not be a constant, but an operator which does not\ncommute with all observables. All these novel possibilities arise within the\nrules of conventional quantum physics,and with no serious input from gravity\nphysics.",

The estimate of the background due to\nneutrons is based primarily on the observation of multiple-scatter events that\nshould all be neutrons.

Results of CDMS data from 1998 and 1999 with a relaxed\nfiducial-volume cut (resulting in 15.8 kg-days exposure on Ge) are consistent\nwith an earlier analysis with a more restrictive fiducial-volume cut.\nTwenty-three WIMP candidate events are observed, but these events are\nconsistent with a background from neutrons in all ways tested.

Results are compatible with\nsome regions reported as allowed at 3-sigma by the annual-modulation\nmeasurement of the DAMA collaboration.

Our Jacobian rings give an algebraic description of the cohomology of the\nopen complement $X-Z$ and it is a natural generalization of the Poincar\\'e\nresidue representation of the cohomology of a hypersurface originally invented\nby Griffiths. The main results generalize the Macaulay's duality theorem and\nthe Donagi's symmetrizer lemma for usual Jacobian rings for hypersurfaces. A\nfeature that distinguishes our generalized Jacobian rings from usual ones is\nthat there are instances where duality fails to be perfect while the defect can\nbe controlled explicitly by using the defining equations of $Z$ in $X$. Two\napplications of the main results are given: One is the infinitesimal Torelli\nproblem for open complete intersections. Another is an explicit bound for\nNori's connectivity in case of complete intersections. The results have been\napplied also to study of algebraic cycles in several other works.",

    "summary": "We report on the results of deep narrow-band Ly-alpha, U and I imaging of the\nfields of two GRBs at z=2.04 (GRB 000301C and GRB 000926). We find that the\nhost galaxy of GRB 000926 is an extended, strong Ly-alpha emitter with a\nrest-frame equivalent width of 71+20-15 AA. The galaxy consists of two main\ncomponents and several fainter knots. GRB 000926 occurred in the western\ncomponent, whereas most of the Ly-alpha luminosity (about 65%) originates in\nthe eastern component. Using archival HST images of the host galaxy we measure\nthe spectral slopes (f_lambda prop. to lambda^beta) of the two components to\nbeta = -2.4+-0.3 (east) and -1.4+-0.2 (west). This implies that both components\ncontain at most small amounts of dust, consistent with the observed strong\nLy-alpha emission. The western component has a slightly redder V-I colour than\nthe eastern component, suggesting the presence of at least some dust. We do not\ndetect the host galaxy of GRB 000301C in neither Ly-alpha emission nor in U and\nI-band images. We infer a limit of U(AB)>27.7 (2-sigma limit per arcsec^2). The\nupper limits on the Ly-alpha flux implies a Ly-alpha equivalent width upper\nlimit of 150AA. We find 11 and 8 other galaxies with excess emission in the\nnarrow filter in the fields of GRB 000301C and GRB 000926 respectively. Based\non these detections we conclude that GRB 000926 occurred in one of the\nstrongest centres of star formation within several Mpc, whereas GRB 000301C\noccurred in an intrinsically very faint galaxy far from being the strongest\ncentre of star formation in its galactic environment. Under the hypothesis that\nGRBs trace star formation, the wide range of GRB host galaxy luminosities\nimplies a very steep faint end slope of the high redshift galaxy luminosity\nfunction.",

(II) Overall\nconstant coefficient of the fermion generating functional. (III) Fermion\npropagator appearing in external fermion lines and the propagator connected to\nYukawa vertices. The first effect appears from the transformation of the path\nintegral measure and it is absorbed into a suitable definition of the constant\nphase factor for each topological sector; in this sense there appears no ``CP\nanomaly''. The second constant arises from the explicit breaking in the action\nand it is absorbed by the suitable weights with which topological sectors are\nsummed. The last one in the propagator is inherent to this formulation and\ncannot be avoided by a mere modification of the projection operator, for\nexample, in the framework of the Ginsparg-Wilson operator. This breaking\nemerges as an (almost) contact term in the propagator when the Higgs field,\nwhich is treated perturbatively, has no vacuum expectation value. In the\npresence of the vacuum expectation value, however, a completely new situation\narises and the breaking becomes intrinsically non-local, though this breaking\nmay still be removed in a suitable continuum limit. This non-local CP breaking\nis expected to persist for a non-perturbative treatment of the Higgs coupling.",

Although the standard evolutionary scenario\nof cataclysmic variables predicts lower mass-transfer rates in systems with\nshorter orbital periods, we revealed firm evidence of a relatively high\nmass-transfer rate from its large proper motion and bright apparent magnitude.\nIts proximity indicates that we have overlooked a number of objects in this new\nclass.

Using\nthe galaxy overdensity and assuming a bias parameter b = 3 - 5, the mass is\nestimated to be ~10^15 M_sun. The radio galaxy itself is surrounded by an\nuniquely asymmetric Lyman-alpha halo.

Five other objects have absorption\nwhich removes an unprecedented ~90% of all flux shortward of MgII. The\nabsorption in one of them has varied across the ultraviolet with an amplitude\nand rate of change as great as ever seen. This same object may also show broad\nH-beta absorption. Numerous reddened BAL quasars have been found, including at\nleast one reddened mini-BAL quasar with very strong FeII emission. The five\nreddest objects have continuum reddenings of E(B-V)~0.5, and in two of them we\nfind strong evidence that the reddening curve is even steeper than that of the\nSMC. We have found at least one object with absorption from FeIII but not FeII.\nThis may be due to a high column density of moderately high-ionization gas, but\nthe FeIII level populations must also be affected by some sort of resonance.\nFinally, we have found two luminous, probably reddened high-redshift objects\nwhich may be BAL quasars whose troughs partially cover different regions of the\ncontinuum source as a function of velocity.",

To understand such\neffects, we analyse the phase behaviour of thin hard rods with length\npolydispersity. Our treatment is based on a simplified Onsager theory, obtained\nby truncating the series expansion of the angular dependence of the excluded\nvolume. We describe the model and give the full phase equilibrium equations;\nthese are then solved numerically using the moment free energy method which\nreduces the problem from one with an infinite number of conserved densities to\none with a finite number of effective densities that are moments of the full\ndensity distribution. The method yields exactly the onset of nematic ordering.\nBeyond this, results are approximate but we show that they can be made\nessentially arbitrarily precise by adding adaptively chosen extra moments,\nwhile still avoiding the numerical complications of a direct solution of the\nfull phase equilibrium conditions.\n  We investigate in detail the phase behaviour of systems with three different\nlength distributions: a (unimodal) Schulz distribution, a bidisperse\ndistribution and a bimodal mixture of two Schulz distributions which\ninterpolates between these two cases. A three-phase isotropic-nematic-nematic\ncoexistence region is shown to exist for the bimodal and bidisperse length\ndistributions if the ratio of long and short rod lengths is sufficiently large,\nbut not for the unimodal one. We systematically explore the topology of the\nphase diagram as a function of the width of the length distribution and of the\nrod length ratio in the bidisperse and bimodal cases.",

For compactifications of IIB supergravity\non a circle, G=SL(2,R) and there are three distinct gauged supergravities that\nresult, corresponding to monodromies in the three conjugacy classes of SL(2,R).\nThere is one gauging of the compact SO(2) subgroup of the SL(2,R) and two\ndistinct gaugings of non-compact SO(1,1) subgroups, embedded differently in\nSL(2,R). The non-compact gaugings can be obtained from the compact one via an\nanalytic continuation of the kind used in D=4 gauged supergravities.

The experimental part of the work\nconsists of Mossbauer measurements in Fe-C alloys with up to about 12 atomic\npercent C, which are interpreted in terms of two alternative models for the\ndistribution of C atoms in the interstitial sites. The theoretical part\ncombines an analysis of the chemical potential of C based on the quasichemical\napproximation to the statistical mechanics of interstitial solutions, with\nthree-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations. The latter were performed by\nassuming a gas like mixture of C atoms and vacancies (Va) in the octahedral\ninterstitial sites. The number of C-C, C-Va and Va-Va pairs calculated using\nMonte Carlo simulations are compared with those given by the quasichemical\nmodel. Furthermore, the relative fraction of the various Fe environments were\ncalculated and compared with those extracted from the Mossbauer spectra. The\nsimulations reproduce remarkably well the relative fractions obtained assuming\nthe Fe(8)C(1-y) model for Mossbauer spectra, which includes some blocking of\nthe nearest neighbour interstitial sites by a C atom. With the new experimental\nand theoretical information obtained in the present study, a critical\ndiscussion is reported of the extent to which such blocking effect is accounted\nfor in current thermodynamic models of the Fe-C fcc phase.\n  Abstract PACS Codes: 2.70.Uu, 76.",

The procedure consists of assigning\ncosmological initial conditions to the particles of a single halo with a EPSF\ntechnique and following only the dynamical evolution using a serial N-body\ncode. The computational box is fixed with a side of $0.5 h^{-1}$ Mpc. This\nallows to simulate galaxy cluster halos using appropriate scaling relations, to\nensure savings in computing time and code speed. The code can describe the\nproperties of halos composed of collisionless or collisional dark matter. For\ncollisionless Cold Dark Matter (CDM) particles the NFW profile is reproduced\nfor galactic halos as well as galaxy cluster halos. Using this numerical\ntechnique we study some characteristics of halos assumed to be isolated or\nplaced in a cosmological context in presence of weak self-interacting dark\nmatter: the soft core formation and the core collapse. The self-interacting\ndark matter cross section per unit mass is assumed to be inversely proportional\nto the particle collision velocity: $\\sigma/m_{x} \\propto 1/v$.",

We compute limits on WIMP properties for\nvarious models of Draco's dark matter halo. We find that if the halo is nearly\nisothermal, as the new measurements indicate, then current gamma ray flux\nlimits prohibit much of the neutralino parameter space. If Draco has a moderate\nmagnetic field, then current radio limits can rule out more of it. These\nresults are appreciably stronger than other current constraints, and so\nacquiring more detailed data on Draco's density profile becomes one of the most\npromising avenues for identifying dark matter.",

We show that when all lasers are\ntuned to the exact unperturbed resonances, part of the four-wave mixing (FWM)\nfield is strongly absorbed. The part which is not absorbed has the exact\nintensity required to destructively interfere with the excitation pathway\ninvolved in producing the FWM state. We show that with this three-photon\ndestructive interference, the conversion efficiency can still be as high as\n25%. Contrary to common belief,our calculation shows that this process, where\nan ideal one-photon electromagnetically induced transparency is established, is\nnot most suitable for high efficiency conversion. With appropriate\nphase-matching and propagation distance, and when the three-photon destructive\ninterference does not occur, we show that the photon flux conversion efficiency\nis independent of probe intensity and can be close to 100%. In addition, we\nshow clearly that the conversion efficiency is not determined by the maximum\natomic coherence between two lower excited states, as commonly believed. It is\nthe combination of phase-matching and constructive interference involving the\ntwo terms arising in producing the mixing wave that is the key element for the\noptimized FWM generation. Indeed, in this scheme no appreciable excited state\nis produced, so that the atomic coherence between states |0> and |2> is always\nvery small.",

New parameterizations are\nderived for the quark and gluon distributions for the kinematic range $x\n\\epsilon [10^{-9},1], Q^2 \\epsilon [1,10^6] \\GeV^2$. The extrapolation far\noutside the domain of the current measurements is given both to allow for\napplications at higher values of $Q^2$ and to be able to calculate integral\nproperties of the present distributions. The values of $\\Lambda_{\\rm QCD}$ and\n$\\alpha_s(M_z)$ are determined. Emphasis is put on the derivation of the fully\ncorrelated $1\\sigma$ error bands for these distributions, which are also given\nin terms of parameterizations and are directly applicable to determine\nexperimental errors of other polarized observables. The impact of the variation\nof both the renormalization and factorization scales on the value of $\\alpha_s$\nis studied. Finally we perform a factorization--scheme invariant QCD analysis\nbased on the observables $g_1(x,Q^2)$ and $d g_1(x,Q^2)/d \\log(Q^2)$ in\nnext-to-leading order, which is compared to the standard analysis. A series of\nlow moments of parton densities, accounting for error correlation, are given to\nallow for comparison with results from lattice simulations.",

It is\nshown that for jetted GRBs this number is smaller for smaller jet opening angle\n(theta), contrary to naive expectation. For a beaming factor\nf_b^{-1}=(theta^2/2)^{-1} = 500, roughly the value inferred by Frail et al.\n(2001) from analysis of afterglow light curves, we predict that between several\nhundreds to several thousands orphan radio afterglows should be detectable\n(over all sky) above 1 mJy at GHz frequencies at any given time. This orphan\npopulation is dominated by sources lying at distances of a few hundred Mpc, and\nhaving an age of ~1 yr. A search for point-like radio transients with flux\ndensities greater than 6 mJy was conducted using the FIRST and NVSS surveys,\nyielding a list of 25 orphan candidates. We argue that most of the candidates\nare unlikely to be radio supernovae. However, the possibility that they are\nradio loud AGNs cannot be ruled out without further observations. Our analysis\nsets an upper limit for the all sky number of radio orphans, which corresponds\nto a lower limit f_b^{-1}>10 on the beaming factor. Rejection of all candidates\nfound in our search would imply f_b^{-1}>100. This, and the fact that some\ncandidates may indeed be radio afterglows, strongly motivate further\nobservations of these transients.",

The\nresulting X-ray spectrum has the best combination of signal-to-noise and\nresolution ever obtained for an AGN. This spectrum reveals absorption lines\nfrom H-like and He-like ions of N, O, Ne, Mg, Al, Si, and S. There are also\npossible absorption lines from H-like and He-like Ar and Ca. We also identify\ninner-shell absorption from lower-ionization ions such as Si_VII-Si_XII and\nS_XII-S_XIV. The iron absorption spectrum is very rich; L-shell lines of\nFe_XVII-Fe_XXIV are detected, strong complex of M-shell lines, and probable\nresonance lines from Fe_XXV. The absorption lines are blueshifted relative to\nthe systemic velocity by a mean velocity of -590+-150 km/s. We resolve many of\nthe absorption lines, and their mean FWHM is 820+-280 km/s. We do not find\ncorrelations between the velocity shifts or the FWHMs with the ionization\npotentials of the ions. Most absorption lines show asymmetry, having more\nextended blue wings than red wings. In O_VII we have resolved this asymmetry to\nbe from an additional absorption system at ~ -1300 km/s. The two X-ray\nabsorption systems are consistent in velocity shift and FWHM with the ones\nidentified in the UV lines of C IV, N V, and H I. Equivalent width measurements\nfor all lines are given and column densities are calculated for several ions.\nWe resolve the narrow Fe_K\\alpha line at 6398.2+-3.3 eV to have a FWHM of\n1720+-360 km/s, which suggests that this narrow line may be emitted from the\nouter part of the broad line region or the inner part of the torus.

On-shell renormalization conditions\nare applied to determine the counterterms for the gaugino-mass-parameters $M_1,\nM_2$ and the Higgsino-mass parameter $\\mu$. The input is fixed in terms of\nthree pole masses (two charginos and one neutralino); the other pole masses\nreceive a shift with respect to the tree-level masses, which can amount to\nseveral GeV. The detailed evaluation shows that both the fermionic/sfermionic\nloop contributions and the non-(s)fermionic loop contributions are of the same\norder of magnitude and are thus relevant for precision studies at future\ncolliders.",

A detailed\nderivation of this QED$_3$ theory is given and some of its main physical\nconsequences are inferred for the pseudogap state.

Further,\namplitudes are constructed using the invariant parameters which are appropriate\nto use as driving terms in the multi-particle, multichannel non-perturbative,\ncluster decomposable, relativistic scattering equations of the Faddeev-type\nintegral equations recently presented by Alfred, Kwizera, Lindesay and Noyes.\nIt is therefore anticipated that when so employed, the resulting multi-channel\nsolutions will also be unitary. The process preserves the usual\nparticle-antiparticle symmetries. To illustrate this process, we construct a\nJ=0 scattering length model chosen for simplicity. We also exhibit a class of\nphysical models which contain a finite quantum mass parameter and are Lorentz\ninvariant. These are constructed to reduce in the appropriate limits, and with\nthe proper choice of value and sign of the interaction parameter, to the\nasymptotic solution of the non-relativistic Coulomb problem, including the\nforward scattering singularity, the essential singularity in the phase, and the\nBohr bound-state spectrum.",

    "summary": "A mechanism of sympatric speciation is presented based on the\ninteraction-induced developmental plasticity of phenotypes. First, phenotypes\nof individuals with identical genotypes split into a few groups, according to\ninstability in the developmental dynamics that are triggered with the\ncompetitive interaction among individuals. Then, through mutational change of\ngenes, the phenotypic differences are fixed to genes, until the groups are\ncompletely separated in genes as well as phenotypes. It is also demonstrated\nthat the proposed theory leads to hybrid sterility under sexual recombination,\nand thus speciation is completed in the sense of reproductive isolation. As a\nresult of this post-mating isolation, the mating preference evolves later. When\nthere are two alleles, the correlation between alleles is formed, to\nconsolidate the speciation. When individuals are located in space, different\nspecies are later segregated spatially, implying that the speciation so far\nregarded to be allopatric may be a result of sympatric speciation.\nRelationships with previous theories, frequency-dependent selection,\nreinforcement, Baldwin's effect, phenotypic plasticity, and resource\ncompetition are briefly discussed. Relevance of the results to natural\nevolution are discussed, including punctuated equilibrium, incomplete\npenetrance in mutants, and the change in flexibility in genotype-phenotype\ncorrespondence. Finally, it is discussed how our theory is confirmed both in\nfield and in laboratory (in an experiment with the use of E coli.).",

We refer to this phenomenon as the $n$% th-order\ndecoherence. In this paper we show that, just as the first-order coherence can\nbe understood as the interference of the amplitudes for two distinct paths, the\nhigher order coherence may be understood as the interference of multiple\namplitudes corresponding to multiple paths. To see this, we introduce the\nconcept of $n$th-order ``multi-particle wave amplitude''. It turns out that the\n$n$th-order correlation function can be expressed as the square norm of some\n``multi-particle wave amplitude'' for the closed system or as the sum of such\nsquare norms for the open system.

We calculate the visibility correlation function <V_nu(u)\nV_nu'(u)> at two frequencies nu and nu' of the redshifted HI emission for an\ninterferometric observation. In particular we give numerical results for the\ntwo GMRT channels centered around nu =325 and 610 MHz from density\ninhomogeneity and peculiar velocity of the HI distribution. The visibility\ncorrelation is ~10^-9 to 10^-10 Jy^2. We calculate the signal-to-noise for\ndetecting the correlation signal in the presence of system noise and show that\nthe GMRT might detect the signal for integration times ~ 100 hrs. We argue that\nthe measurement of visibility correlation allows optimal use of the\nuncorrelated nature of the system noise across baselines and frequency\nchannels.",

This\nis allowed since, as it happens in every quantum theory for spin-1/2 particles,\nthe momentum operator (that is conserved) and the velocity operator (that is\nnot) are independent operators, which refer to independent quantities. As a\nconsequence, at variance with ordinary Dirac particles, for PT's the average\nvelocity is not equal to the classical velocity, but actually to the velocity\n\"dual\" of the classical velocity. The speed of PT's is therefore smaller than\nthe speed of light. Since a lot of experimental data seems to involve a\nnegative mass squared for neutrinos, we suggest that these particles might be\nPT's, travelling, because of their very small mass, at subluminal speeds very\nclose to c. The present theory is shown to be separately invariant under the C,\nP, T transformations; the covariance under Lorentz transformations is also\nproved. Furthermore, we derive the kinematical constraints linking 4-impulse,\n4-velocity and 4-polarization of free PT's",

The dramatic breakdown of the operator\nproduct expansion at large Bjorken x due to the formation of a narrow jet with\ninvariant mass W (W^2=Q^2(1-x)/x) calls for an alternative approach. Our main\nconjecture is that the dominant contribution at each twist is the one which\nmixes under renormalization with the leading twist (ultraviolet dominance). At\ntwist two the dominant perturbative corrections at large x due to soft and\ncollinear radiation can be factorized into a jet function. From the ultraviolet\ndominance conjecture it follows that the twist two parton distribution as well\nas the jet function actually factorize to any order in the twist expansion.\nThis factorization suggests that non-perturbative corrections ~1/W^{2n}\nexponentiate together with the leading twist. We verify explicitly, at the\nlevel of a single dressed gluon, the cancellation between ambiguities due to\ninfrared renormalons in the twist-two coefficient functions and those due to\nthe ultraviolet divergence of twist-four matrix elements. Independently of the\nrenormalon analysis, we show that the dominant contribution to twist four at\nlarge x is associated with a twist-two like configuration: the final states are\nidentical to those of twist two, whereas the initial states differ just by\nadditional partons carrying small momentum fractions.

The radio data are in excellent agreement with that expected for\nfree-free wind emission. and the ionized mass-loss rate is derived. The X-ray\nemission measure distribution shows a dominant contribution from cool plasma at\nkT$_{cool}$ = 0.5 keV (6 MK) which is only weakly absorbed. We argue that this\ncool emission originates at hundreds of radii if the wind is spherical and\nhomogeneous and derive shock velocities and the X-ray filling factor using\nradiative shock models. A surprising result is the unambiguous detection of a\nhard X-ray component clearly seen in the hard-band images and the spectra. This\nhard component accounts for about half of the observed flux and can be\nacceptably fitted by a hot optically thin thermal plasma or a power-law model.\nIf the emission is thermal, then a temperature kT$_{hot}$ $\\geq$ 3 keV is\nderived. Such high temperatures are not predicted by current instability-driven\nwind shock models. We examine several alternatives and show that the hard\nemission could be accounted for by the WR wind shocking onto a close stellar\ncompanion which has so far escaped detection.

    "summary": "We study the so-called Gray filtration on the set of phantom maps between two\nspaces. Using both its algebraic characterization and the Sullivan completion\napproach to phantom maps, we generalize some of the recent results of Le,\nMcGibbon and Strom. We particularly emphasize on the set of phantom maps with\ninfinite Gray index, describing it in an original algebraic way.\n  We furthermore introduce and study a natural filtration on SNT-sets (that is\nsets of homotopy types of spaces having the same n-type for all n), which\nappears to have the same algebraic characterization of the Gray one on phantom\nmaps. For spaces whose rational homotopy type is that of an H-space or a\nco-H-space, we establish criteria permitting to determinate those subsets of\nthis filtration which are non trivial, generalizing work of McGibbon and\nMoller.\n  We finally describe algebraically the natural connection between phantom maps\nand SNT-theory, associating to a phantom map its homotopy fiber or cofiber. We\nuse this description to show that this connection respect filtrations, and to\nfind generic examples of spaces for which the filtration on the corresponding\nSNT-set consists of infinitely many strict inclusions.",

The first chapter is a pedagogical\nintroduction about supergravity theories. In the second chapter closed strings\nare analyzed, with particular emphasis on type IIB, whose orientifold\nprojection, in order to build type-I models, is the subject of the third\nchapter. Original results are reported in chapters 4 and 5. In chapter 4 we\ndescribe the complete coupling of (1,0) six-dimensional supergravity to tensor,\nvector and hypermultiplets. The generalized Green-Schwarz mechanism implies\nthat the resulting theory embodies factorized gauge and supersymmetry\nanomalies, to be disposed of by fermion loops. Consequently, the low-energy\ntheory is determined by the Wess-Zumino consistency conditions, rather than by\nthe requirement of supersymmetry, and this procedure does not fix a quartic\ncoupling for the gauginos. In chapter 5 we describe the low-energy effective\nactions for type-I models with brane supersymmetry breaking, resulting form the\nsimultaneous presence of supersymmetric bulks, with one or more gravitinos, and\nnon-supersymmetric combinations of BPS branes.The consistency of the resulting\ngravitino couplings implies that local supersymmetry is non-linearly realized\non some branes.

In this paper,\nwe show that G is closely related to the Robinson-Schensted algorithm, and use\nthis connection to give a new proof of the above representation theorem. The\nnew proof is valid for a larger class of random walks and yields additional\ninformation about the joint law of X and G(X). The corresponding results for\nthe Brownian model are recovered by Donsker's theorem. These are connected with\nHermitian Brownian motion and the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble of random matrix\ntheory. The connection we make between the path-transformation G and the RS\nalgorithm also provides a new formula and interpretation for the latter. This\ncan be used to study properties of the RS algorithm and, moreover, extends\neasily to a continuous setting.",

For fixed functional form of the kernel, model selection\namounts to tuning kernel parameters and the slack penalty coefficient $C$. We\nbegin by reviewing a recently developed probabilistic framework for SVM\nclassification. An extension to the case of SVMs with quadratic slack penalties\nis given and a simple approximation for the evidence is derived, which can be\nused as a criterion for model selection. We also derive the exact gradients of\nthe evidence in terms of posterior averages and describe how they can be\nestimated numerically using Hybrid Monte Carlo techniques. Though\ncomputationally demanding, the resulting gradient ascent algorithm is a useful\nbaseline tool for probabilistic SVM model selection, since it can locate maxima\nof the exact (unapproximated) evidence. We then perform extensive experiments\non several benchmark data sets. The aim of these experiments is to compare the\nperformance of probabilistic model selection criteria with alternatives based\non estimates of the test error, namely the so-called ``span estimate'' and\nWahba's Generalized Approximate Cross-Validation (GACV) error. We find that all\nthe ``simple'' model criteria (Laplace evidence approximations, and the Span\nand GACV error estimates) exhibit multiple local optima with respect to the\nhyperparameters. While some of these give performance that is competitive with\nresults from other approaches in the literature, a significant fraction lead to\nrather higher test errors. The results for the evidence gradient ascent method\nshow that also the exact evidence exhibits local optima, but these give test\nerrors which are much less variable and also consistently lower than for the\nsimpler model selection criteria.",

The supergiants were identified in previously\npublished stellar photometry measured from Hubble Space Telescope imaging. The\nhigh resolution imaging and low dust environment provided high photometric\naccuracy such that the main sequence and blue He-burning supergiants are\nclearly separated. This allows us to isolate the He-burning phase at both the\nred and blue ends of the so called ``blue-loops''. The B/R supergiant ratio\nprovides an observational constraint on the relative lifetimes of these two\nphases which is a sensitive test for convection, mass loss, and rotation\nparameters. These parameters have direct implications for the period-luminosity\nrelationship for Cepheid variable stars. Previous studies have used a single\nnumber to represent this ratio. However, since the B/R ratio is a fairly strong\nfunction of mass for a single age stellar population, both changes in recent\nstar formation rate and choice of luminosity cut-off can dramatically affect\nthe result. We have analyzed the ratio as a function of age, or equivalently,\nmass. This method eliminates the confusion of unknown star formation histories\nso that B/R can be a more reliable diagnostic tool. We compare the result with\na model based on stellar evolution tracks of an appropriate metallicity. The\nfunctional form of the observed ratio matches the model extremely well.\nHowever, the observed B/R ratio is lower than the model by a factor of two.\nThis result suggests that stellar rotation is an important effect in the\nevolution of these stars.",

    "summary": "We show that noncommutative gauge theory in two dimensions is an exactly\nsolvable model. A cohomological formulation of gauge theory defined on the\nnoncommutative torus is used to show that its quantum partition function can be\nwritten as a sum over contributions from classical solutions. We derive an\nexplicit formula for the partition function of Yang-Mills theory defined on a\nprojective module for arbitrary noncommutativity parameter \\theta which is\nmanifestly invariant under gauge Morita equivalence. The energy observables are\nshown to be smooth functions of \\theta. The construction of noncommutative\ninstanton contributions to the path integral is described in some detail. In\ngeneral, there are infinitely many gauge inequivalent contributions of fixed\ntopological charge, along with a finite number of quantum fluctuations about\neach instanton. The associated moduli spaces are combinations of symmetric\nproducts of an ordinary two-torus whose orbifold singularities are not resolved\nby noncommutativity. In particular, the weak coupling limit of the gauge theory\nis independent of \\theta and computes the symplectic volume of the moduli space\nof constant curvature connections on the noncommutative torus.",

All these edges are dependent on the accretion rate and are\nnon-axisymmetric and time-variable. Although all are generally located in the\nvicinity of the marginally stable orbit, significant displacements can occur,\nand data interpretations placing the disk edge precisely at this point can be\nmisleading.

This spectrum was obtained with the XMM-Newton\nReflection Grating Spectrometer. Emission lines from H-like and He-like low-Z\nions (from C to Si) and Fe-L-shell ions dominate the spectrum. Strong, narrow\nradiative recombination continua (RRC) for several ions are also present,\nimplying that most of the observed soft-X-ray emission arises in\nlow-temperature (few eV) plasma. This plasma is photoionized by the inferred\nnuclear continuum (obscured along our line of sight), as in the unified model\nof active galactic nuclei (AGN). We find excess emission (compared with pure\nrecombination) in all resonance lines (np to 1s) up to the photoelectric edge,\ndemonstrating the importance of photoexcitation as well. We introduce a simple\nmodel of a cone of plasma irradiated by the nuclear continuum; the line\nemission we observe along our line of sight perpendicular to the cone is\nproduced through recombination/radiative cascade following photoionization and\nradiative decay following photoexcitation. A remarkably good fit is obtained to\nthe H-like/He-like ionic line series, with inferred radial ionic column\ndensities consistent with recent observations of warm absorbers in Seyfert 1\ngalaxies. Previous Chandra imaging revealed a large (extending out to 500 pc)\nionization cone containing most of the X-ray flux, implying that the warm\nabsorber in NGC 1068 is a large-scale outflow. To explain the ionic column\ndensities, a broad, flat distribution in the logarithm of the ionization\nparameter ($\\xi=L_X/n_e r^2$) is necessary, spanning $\\log\\xi=0$--3. This\nsuggests either radially-stratified ionization zones or the existence of a\nbroad density distribution (spanning a few orders of magnitude) at each radius.",

Consistent\nresults were obtained when the expanse of the analysis was truncated by\nexcluding the low surface brightness galaxies. Previous claims that M/L_B\nvaries with I_0^{-1/2} are shown to be misleading and/or due to galaxy\nselection effects. Not all low-surface-brightness disk galaxies are dark matter\ndominated.

    "summary": "We studied the stellar population and star clusters around six regions in the\nLarge Magellanic Cloud (LMC) in order to understand the correlation between\nstar formation and cluster formation episodes. We used the stellar data base of\nOGLE II LMC survey and the star cluster catalogues. The analysis of the\ncolour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) were used to estimate the ages of the stellar\npopulation. It is found that most of the regions have undergone three major\nstar formation episodes. The star formation which began about 4 Gyr ago,\ncontinued upto 1 Gyr, or continued further. The other two events have taken\nplace around 300 Myr, and 100 Myr. A few star clusters were formed during the\nfirst of the three star formation events in 5 regions. On all the six regions,\na good correlation is seen between the star and cluster formation events which\noccurred at 300 Myr and 100 Myr. The cluster formation events and the fraction\nof star clusters formed were found to be very similar for two regions located\nto the south-east of the Bar, suggesting similar cluster formation triggers at\nalmost similar instances. The two recent star formation events seem to\ncorrelate with the interaction of LMC with Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and\nGalaxy. Hence it is quite likely that the young populous star clusters in the\nLMC are formed as a result of the star formation events started due to\ngalaxy-galaxy interactions and the further propagation of such star formation.",

The shape of the nuclear\nrecoil energy spectrum from pointlike dark-matter particles, e.g., neutralinos,\nis determined by the velocity distribution of dark matter in the galactic halo\nand by nuclear form factors. In contrast, typical cross sections of\nnon-pointlike dark matter, for example, Q-balls, have a new form factor, which\ndecreases rapidly with the recoil energy. Therefore, a signal from\nnon-pointlike dark matter is expected to peak near the experimental threshold\nand to fall off rapidly at higher energies. Although the width of the signal is\npractically independent of the dark matter velocity dispersion, its height is\nexpected to exhibit an annual modulation due to the changes in the dark matter\nflux.",

In the present study, the nature of the magnetic excitations at low\ntemperature has been investigated by specific heat measurements on a\nPr0.8Ca0.2MnO3 single crystal. The decrease of the specific heat under magnetic\nfield is qualitatively consistent with a suppression of ferromagnetic spin\nwaves in a magnetic field. However, at low temperature, the qualitative\nagreement with the ferromagnetic spin waves picture is poor. It appears that\nthe large reduction of the specific heat due to the spin waves is compensated\nby a Schottky-like contribution possibly arising from a Zeeman splitting of the\nground state multiplet of the Pr{3+} ions.",

The required hierarchy among the solar and atmospheric neutrino\nmass scales follows in this framework in the presence of an approximate Higgs -\nslepton universality at the weak scale. The solar mixing angle is shown to be\nrelated to non-universality in slepton mass terms specifically to differences\nin soft parameters of the first two leptonic generations. It is shown that this\nflavour universality violation should be as strong as the Higgs-slepton\nuniversality violation if solar neutrino mixing angle is to be large. The\nstandard supergravity models with universal boundary conditions at a high scale\nlead to the required Higgs-slepton universality violations but the predicted\nviolation of flavour universality among the first two generations is much\nsmaller than required. This model therefore cannot provide an explanation of\nlarge solar neutrino mixing angle unless some universality violations in soft\nsupersymmetry breaking parameters are introduced at a high scale itself.",

With increasing redshift the\nfraction of this S0 galaxy population is observed to strongly decrease (e.g. by\na factor ~2-3 to z = 0.5) in favor of the spiral galaxy fraction while the\nnumber of bright ellipticals does not seem to change. The infalling field\ngalaxy population that successively builds up the cluster also is spiral rich\nand S0 poor. It has hence been suspected that galaxy transformation processes,\neither due to galaxy -- galaxy or to galaxy -- ICM interactions, are\nresponsible for this change. Complementing dynamical and morphological studies,\nwe use evolutionary synthesis models describing various possible effects of\nthose interactions on the star formation rates of the infalling spirals. We\nstudy the effects of starbursts of various strengths as well as of the\ntruncation of star formation on the color and luminosity evolution of model\ngalaxies of various spectral types. Comparison with observed properties of the\nlocal S0 galaxy population is used to constrain possible S0 formation\nmechanisms. We find that star formation truncation in spiral galaxies earlier\nthan Sd-type, if occurring not too long ago, as well as starbursts more than 3\nGyr ago and followed by complete star formation extinction in spirals -- again\nearlier than Sd-- may well account for the observed average S0 luminosities and\ncolors. Late-type galaxies (Sd), even after a strong burst, remain either too\nblue or too faint. Our results are in agreement with studies of spectral\nfeatures of cluster S0s but allow for stronger constraints.",

The analysis uses\nwide field photometry, encompassing about 1deg x 1deg (the total covered area\nbeing 0.75 deg^2), which samples the galaxy out to its tidal radius. Derivation\nof the SFH has been performed using the synthetic partial model technique.\n  The resulting SFH shows that Ursa Minor hosts a predominantly old stellar\npopulation, with virtually all the stars formed earlier than 10 Gyr ago and 90%\nof them formed earlier than 13 Gyr ago. Nevertheless, Ursa Minor\ncolor-magnitude diagram shows several stars above the main, old turn-off\nforming a blue-plume (BP). If these stars were genuine, main-sequence stars,\nUrsa Minor would have maintained a low star formation rate extending up to 2\nGyr ago. However, several indications (relative amount and spatial distribution\nof BP stars and difficulty to retain processed gas) play against this\npossibility. In such context, the most reliable hypothesis is that BP stars are\nblue-stragglers originating in the old population, Ursa Minor hence remaining\nthe only Milky Way dSph satellite to host a pure old stellar population. A\nmarginally significant age gradient is detected, in the sense that stars in\nouter regions are slightly younger, in average.\n  The distance of Ursa Minor, has been calculated using the magnitude of the\nhorizontal-branch and a calibration based on Hipparcos data of main sequence\nsub-dwarfs. We estimated a distance d=76+/-4 Kpc, which is slightly larger than\nprevious estimates. From the RGB color, we estimate a metallicity\n[Fe/H]=-1.9+/-0.2, in agreement with a previous spectroscopic determination. No\nmetallicity gradients have been detected across the galaxy.",

From a comparison with spectroscopic element\nabundances, we find the best correlation with the sum C+N. The high Stroemgren\nmetallicities, if interpreted by strong CN-bands, result from progressively\nhigher N and perhaps C abundances in comparison to iron. We see an enrichment\nalready among the metal-poor population, which is difficult to explain by\nself-enrichment alone. An attractive speculation (done before) is that omega\nCen was the nucleus of a dwarf galaxy. We propose a scenario in which omega Cen\nexperienced mass inflow over a long period of time, until the gas content of\nits host galaxy was so low that star formation in omega Cen stopped, or\nalternatively the gas was stripped off during its infall in the Milky Way\npotential.

Were this possible, however, it\nwould provide a form of black hole hair, and contradict the idea that global\nquantum numbers are violated in black hole evaporation. We demonstrate\ndynamical mechanisms that negate the formal procedure, both for topological\ncharge (Skyrmions) and complex scalar-field charge. Skyrmions collapse to the\nhorizon; scalar-field charge fluctuates uncontrollably.",

We also show that\npseudo-Anosov flows induce actions on circles. In all cases, these actions can\nbe made into faithful ones, so pi_1(M) is isomorphic to a subgroup of\nHomeo(S^1). In addition, we show that the fundamental group of the Weeks\nmanifold has no faithful action on S^1. As a corollary, the Weeks manifold does\nnot admit a tight essential lamination, a pseudo-Anosov flow, or a taut\nfoliation. Finally, we give a proof of Thurston's universal circle theorem for\ntaut foliations based on a new, purely topological, proof of the Leaf Pocket\nTheorem.",

We used a simple, pure\nhydrogen LTE model to derive the temperature and surface density distribution\nin the accretion disc. The reconstructed effective temperatures in the disc\nrange between 9000K and 15000K in the inner part of the disc and below 7000K in\nthe outer parts. In the higher states it shows a more or less prominent bright\nspot with T_eff between about 7000K and 8000K.\n  The inner part of the disc (R < 0.3R_L1) is optically thick at all times,\nwhile the outer parts of the disc up to the disc edge (0.51+-0.04R_L1 in the\nhigh state and 0.40+-0.03R_L1 in the low state) deviate from a simple black\nbody spectrum indicating that either the outer disc is optically thin or it\nshows a temperature inversion in the vertical direction.\n  While during high state the disc is variable, it appears rather stable in low\nstate. The variation during high state affects the size of the optically thick\npart of the disc, the white dwarf or boundary layer temperature and the\nuneclipsed component (originating in a disc chromosphere and/or cool disc\nwind), while the actual size of the disc remains constant. The difference\nbetween high and low state is expressed as a change in disc size that also\naffects the size of the optically thick part of the disc and the presence of\nthe bright spot.\n  Using the PPEM method we retrieve a distance for UU Aqr of 207+-10pc,\ncompatible with previous estimates.",

While the\nglobal atmospheric parameters may be determined with good accuracy from the\nStromgren indices, careful abundance analysis must be made for the proposed\nmain targets. This is a time consuming process considering the long list of\nprimary and secondary targets. We have therefore developed new software called\nVWA for this task. The VWA automatically selects the least blended lines from\nthe atomic line database VALD, and consequently adjusts the abundance in order\nto find the best match between the calculated and observed spectra. The\nvariability of HD 49434 was discovered as part of COROT ground-based support\nobservations. Here we present a detailed abundance analysis of HD 49434 using\nVWA. For most elements we find abundances somewhat below the Solar values, in\nparticular we find [Fe/H] = -0.13(14). We also present the results from the\nstudy of the variability that is seen in spectroscopic and photometric time\nseries observations. From the characteristics of the variation seen in\nphotometry and in the line profiles we propose that HD 49434 is a variable star\nof the gamma Doradus type.",

The average impulse delivered to the wall is much\nlarger than the momentum acquired by a single particle under gravity between\ncollisions, reflecting the fact that momentum is transferred to the walls from\nthe bulk of the flow by collisions. At values larger than the average impulse,\nthe probability distribution of impulses is broad and decays exponentially on\nthe scale of the average impulse, just as it does in static granular media. At\nsmall impulse values, the probability distribution evolves continuously with\nflow velocity but does not show a clear signature of the transition from purely\ncollisional flow to intermittently jamming flows.

At intermediate\ndensities, the distribution of local orientational order is bimodal. At fixed\ntemperature, order parameter extrema occur upon compression: a maximum in\norientational order followed by a minimum in translational order. Unlike water,\nhowever, silica's translational order parameter minimum is broad, and there is\nno range of thermodynamic conditions where both parameters are strictly\ncoupled. Furthermore, the temperature-density regime where both structural\norder parameters decrease upon isothermal compression (the structurally\nanomalous regime) does not encompass the region of diffusivity anomalies, as\nwas the case for water.",

In the\nharmonic approximation and neglecting thermal fluctuations we find the\neigenmodes of the system.

The\ncrossover between these two regions is analyzed numerically and the dynamical\nstructure factor is calculated.

The second beam is then\namplitude-modulated according to the outcome of the measurement, and finally\nsqueezed according to the transmittivity of the interferometer. Using strongly\nsqueezed or anti-squeezed probes respectively, one achieves either a projective\nmeasurement, i.e. homodyne statistics arbitrarily close to the intrinsic\nquadrature distribution of the signal, and conditional outputs approaching the\ncorresponding eigenstates, or fully non-destructive one, characterized by an\nalmost uniform homodyne statistics, and by an output state arbitrarily close to\nthe input signal. By varying the squeezing between these two extremes, or\nsimply by tuning the internal phase-shift of the interferometer, the whole set\nof intermediate cases can also be obtained. In particular, an optimal quantum\nnondemolition measurement of quadrature can be achieved, which minimizes the\ninformation gain versus state disturbance trade-off.",

    "summary": "This paper presents a ``man on the street'' view of the current status of the\nspectral cross calibration between the XMM-Newton EPIC, Chandra ACIS-S3, ASCA\nSIS and GIS, and ROSAT PSPC instruments. Using publicly released software for\nthe extraction of spectra and the production of spectral redistribution\nresponse matrices and effective areas, the spectral fits of data from three\nastronomical objects are compared. The three sources are G21.5-0.9 (a heavily\nabsorbed Galactic SNR with a power law spectrum), 1E0102.2-7219 (a SNR in the\nSMC with a line-dominated spectrum), and MS1054.4-0321 (a high redshift cluster\nwith a thermal spectrum). The agreement between the measured fluxes of the\nvarious instruments is within the 10% range, and is better when just XMM-Newton\nand Chandra are compared. Fitted spectral parameters are also in relatively\ngood agreement although the results are more limited.",

    "summary": "Chandra and XMM-Newton observations have confirmed the presence of large\ntemperature gradients within the cores of many relaxed clusters of galaxies.\nHere we investigate whether thermal conduction operating over those gradients\ncan supply sufficient heat to offset radiative cooling. Narayan & Medvedev\n(2001) and Gruzinov (2002) have noted, using published results on cluster\ntemperatures, that conduction within a factor of a few of the Spitzer rate is\nsufficient to balance bremsstrahlung cooling. From a detailed study of the\ntemperature and emission measure profiles of Abell 2199 and Abell 1835, we find\nthat the heat flux required by conduction is consistent with or below the rate\npredicted by Spitzer in the outer regions of the core. Conduction may therefore\nexplain the lack of observational evidence for large mass cooling rates\ninferred from arguments based simply on radiative cooling, provided that\nconductivity is suppressed by no more than a factor of three below the full\nSpitzer rate. To stem cooling in the cluster centre, however, would necessitate\nconductivity values at least a factor of two larger than the Spitzer values,\nwhich we consider implausible. This may provide an explanation for the observed\nstar formation and optical nebulosities in cluster cores. The solution is\nlikely to be time dependent. We briefly discuss the possible origin of the\ncooler gas and the implications for massive galaxies.",

Thus, uniquely, binary\nlenses can be completely solved with only the addition of a measurement of the\nmicrolensing parallax. This solution will yield the mass, distance, and\ntransverse velocity of the lens relative to the source. To date, only one of\nthe $\\sim 1000$ observed microlensing events has been so solved.\n  We examine the ability of a parallax satellite combined with ground-based\nobservations to solve these events. To measure both components of the vector\nparallax, the lens must be observed near two different caustics. Thus, the\nfinal accuracy is determined mostly by whether one can intensively monitor part\nof the first caustic crossing, by the magnification pattern, and by the path of\nthe source with respect to the lens geometry. We find that vector parallaxes\ncan be measured far more easily for binary lenses than single lenses, requiring\n1-3 orders of magnitude fewer photons. They may thus yield a large number of\ncompletely solved lenses relatively cheaply.",

Our scheme is based on the\nhypothesis that, when the Earth's surface is divided up into local regions of\nmoderate size, vectors of the forecast uncertainties in such regions tend to\nlie in a subspace of much lower dimension than that of the full atmospheric\nstate vector of such a region. Ensemble Kalman Filters, in general, assume that\nthe analysis resulting from the data assimilation lies in the same subspace as\nthe expected forecast error. Under our hypothesis the dimension of this\nsubspace is low. This implies that operations only on relatively low\ndimensional matrices are required. Thus, the data analysis is done locally in a\nmanner allowing massively parallel computation to be exploited. The local\nanalyses are then used to construct global states for advancement to the next\nforecast time. The method, its potential advantages, properties, and\nimplementation requirements are illustrated by numerical experiments on the\nLorenz-96 model. It is found that accurate analysis can be achieved at a cost\nwhich is very modest compared to that of a full global ensemble Kalman Filter.",

We show that many of the problems associated with cosmology and\nquantum gravity follow directly from this assumption. An alternative scale\ninvariant paradigm is proposed, in which the appropriate scale for General\nRelativity takes the Universe as its baseline, and the gravitational force does\nnot have any fixed relationship to forces that apply on the atomic scale. It is\nshown that this gives rise to a quasi-static universe, and that the predicted\nbehaviour of this model can resolve most of the problems associated with the\nstandard Big Bang model. The replacement of Newton's gravitational constant in\nthe quasi-static model by a scale-dependent re-normalisation factor is also\nable to account for a number of astronomical observations that would otherwise\nrequire ad-hoc explanations. Some of the implications of scale invariant\ngravity for Planck scale physics, quantum cosmology, and the nature of time are\ndiscussed.",

The protocol is characterized by a high efficiency, reduced exposure\nto an attack by an eavesdropper, and higher sensitivity to such an attack when\ncompared to other QKD schemes. For example, the efficiency with which\ntransmitted data contribute to the private key is 3/4 compared with 1/4 for\nBB84 [2]. Moreover, an eavesdropper can aquire a maximum of 1/3 of the key\nwhich leads to an error probability in the private key of 1/3. This can be\ncompared to 1/2 and 1/4 for these same parameters in both BB84 and IWY. The\ncombination of these considerations should lead to increased range and key\ndistribution rate over present fiber-based QKD schemes.",

In agreement with previous studies, we\nfind that OVII and OVIII produce the strongest absorption features. The strong\noxygen absorbers that might be detectable with Chandra or XMM-Newton arise in\ngas with T ~ 10^6 K and overdensities delta >~ 100 that are characteristic of\ngalaxy groups. Future X-ray missions could detect weaker oxygen absorption\nproduced by gas with a wider range of temperatures and the lower densities of\nunvirialized structures; they could also detect X-ray forest absorption by C,\nN, Ne, Fe, and possibly Si. If the IGM metallicity is 0.1 solar, then the\npredicted number of systems strong enough for a ~5\\sigma detection with Chandra\nor XMM-Newton is extremely low, though scatter in metallicity would increase\nthe number of strong absorbers even if the mean metallicity remained the same.\nOur simulation reproduces the high observed incidence of OVI absorbers (in the\nUV), and the most promising strategy for finding the X-ray forest is to search\nat the redshifts of known OVI systems, thus reducing the signal-to-noise\nthreshold required for a significant detection. However, while many OVI\nabsorbers have associated OVII or OVIII absorption, the OVI systems trace only\nthe low temperature phases of the X-ray forest, and a full accounting of the\nstrong OVII and OVIII systems will require a mission with the anticipated\ncapabilities of Constellation-X. The large effective area of the XEUS satellite\nwould make it an extremely powerful instrument for studying the IGM, measuring\nX-ray forest absorption by a variety of elements and revealing the shock-heated\nfilaments that may be an important reservoir of cosmic baryons.",

We propose that a topic taxonomy such as\nYahoo! or the Open Directory provides a useful framework for understanding the\nstructure of content-based clusters and communities.

In\naddition, we can measure the probability that a page about one broad topic will\nlink to another broad topic. Extending this experiment, we can measure how\nquickly topic context is lost while walking randomly on the Web graph.\nEstimates of this topic mixing distance may explain why a global PageRank is\nstill meaningful in the context of broad queries.

The presence of strong\nP Cyg feature in the ultraviolet and the unusual presence of high-excitation\noptical lines could be interpreted as an emerging signature of strong\nirradiation field. Since the object is still in this unusual state in 2002\nMarch, we encourage X-ray and spectroscopic observations to detect further\nsignatures of high-energy photons and irradiation.",

In a companion paper (Varniere et al., 2002, hereafter\nPaper II) we will show that these opposite behaviors can be explained in the\ncontext of the Accretion-Ejection Instability recently presented by Tagger and\nPellat (1999).\n  We thus propose that the difference between GRO J1655 and other sources comes\nfrom the fact that in the former, observed in a very high state, the disk inner\nradius always stays close to the Last Stable Orbit.\n  In the course of this analysis, we also indicate interesting differences\nbetween the source properties, when the spectral fits give an anomalously low\ninner disk radius.

Real ER fluids must be polydisperse in\nnature, i.e., the suspended particles can have various sizes and/or different\ndielectric constants. An initial approach for these studies would be the\npoint-dipole (PD) approximation, which is known to err considerably when the\nparticles approach and finally touch due to multipolar interactions. In a\nrecent work, we proposed a dipole-induced-dipole (DID) model for computer\nsimulation of ER fluids, which was shown to be both more accurate than the PD\nmodel and easy to use. The DID model was applied to simulate the athermal\naggregation of particles in ER fluids and the aggregation time was found to be\nsignificantly reduced as compared to the PD model. In this work, we will report\nresults for the case when the dielectric contrasts of some particles can be\nnegative. In which case, the direction of the force is reversed. Moreover, the\ninclusion of DID force further complicates the results because the symmetry\nbetween positive and negative contrasts will be broken by the presence of\ndipole-induced interactions.",

    "summary": "The Accretion-Ejection Instability has been proposed to explain the low\nfrequency Quasi-Periodic Oscillation (QPO) observed in low-mass X-Ray Binaries,\nin particular Black-Hole candidates. Its frequency, typically a fraction of the\nKeplerian frequency at the disk inner radius, is exactly in the range indicated\nby observations. The variations of the frequency with the disk inner radius\n(extracted from spectral fits of the X-ray emission) might thus be a useful\ntest. In this paper we discuss how changes in the rotation curve, due to\nrelativistic effects when the disk approaches the central object, affect the\nphysics of the instability, and thus this frequency-inner radius relation. We\nfind that the relationship between the frequency of the mode and the Keplerian\nfrequency at the inner disk radius ($r_{int}$) departs from the one obtained in\na Keplerian disk, when $r_{int}$ approaches the last stable orbit. This might\nagree with the recently published results, showing a discrepancy between the\nbehavior of the QPO in the micro quasar GRO J1655, compared to other sources\nsuch as XTE J1550 and GRS 1915.\n  In a companion paper (Rodriguez et al., 2002, hereafter Paper I) we have\npresented detailed observational results for GRO J1655 and GRS 1915. We show\nhow the opposite correlations found in these sources between the disk color\nradius (assumed to be close to its inner radius) and the QPO frequency could\nindeed be explained by our theoretical result.",

Here we\ninvestigate the long-term period evolution, covering 340 years, going back to\nits discovery in AD 1662. Wavelets are used to determine both the period and\nsemi-amplitude. We show that the period decreased linearly between 1770 and\n1950; since 1950 the period has stabilized at 385 days. The semi-amplitude\nclosely follows the period evolution. Detailed analysis of the oldest data\nshows that before 1770 the period was about 495 days. We find no evidence for\nan increasing period during this time as found by Wood & Zarro. IRAS data shows\nthat the mass loss dropped dramatically around AD 1750. The decline agrees with\nthe mass-loss formalism from Vassiliadis & Wood, but is much larger than\npredicted by the Bloecker mass-loss law. An outer detached IRAS shell suggests\nthat R Hya has experienced such mass-loss interruptions before. The period\nevolution can be explained by a thermal pulse occuring around AD 1600, or by an\nnon-linear instability leading to an internal relaxation of the stellar\nstructure. The elapsed time between the mass-loss decline giving rise to the\nouter detached shell, and the recent event, of approximately 5000 yr suggests\nthat only one of these events could be due to a thermal pulse. Further\nmonitoring of R Hya is recommended, as both models make strong predictions for\nthe future period evolution. R Hya-type events, on time scales of 10^2-10^3 yr,\ncould provide part of the explanation for the rings seen around some AGB and\npost-AGB stars.",

The deviation of the velocity\ndistribution function from the Maxwellian distribution is quantified by a\nSonine polynomials expansion. The first non-vanishing Sonine coefficient\na_2(t), reveals a complex time dependence which allows to assign the granular\ngas the property of an age.

The disk is divided into an underlying disk and a\ncorona, where the latter is defined as the upper surface layers for which the\neffective optical depth is unity. It is found that a significant part of the\naccretion flow (or dissipation rate) can take place in the corona if the scale\nheight of the magnetic field is larger than that of the disk. The presence of\nsuch a dissipative corona leads to a modification in the topology of local disk\nsolutions. For example, these solutions are found from local stability analysis\nto be both secularly and thermally stable, for accretion rates which are a\nfactor $\\approx$ four higher than those inferred from the stability of standard\ndisk solutions. Thus, the applicability of optically thick disks with\ndissipative coronas are not as restrictive as disks without such coronas and\ncan provide an attractive explanation for the origin of the soft spectral\ncomponent observed in black hole X-ray binary systems.",

As a special case, we reprove the classical Tannaka-Krein\nresult for compact groups. It is only here that analytic aspects enter,\notherwise we proceed in a purely algebraic way.

    "summary": "Here we describe model calculations to follow the spatio-temporal evolution\nof secondary electron cascades in diamond. The band structure of the insulator\nhas been explicitly incorporated into the calculations as it affects\nionizations from the valence band. A Monte-Carlo model was constructed to\ndescribe the path of electrons following the impact of a single electron of\nenergy E 250 eV. The results show the evolution of the secondary electron\ncascades in terms of the number of electrons liberated, the spatial\ndistribution of these electrons, and the energy distribution among the\nelectrons as a function of time. The predicted ionization rates (5-13 electrons\nin 100 fs) lie within the limits given by experiments and phenomenological\nmodels. Calculation of the local electron density and the corresponding Debye\nlength shows that the latter is systematically larger than the radius of the\nelectron cloud. This means that the electron gas generated does not represent a\nplasma in a single impact cascade triggered by an electron of E 250 eV energy.\nThis is important as it justifies the independent-electron approximation used\nin the model. At 1 fs, the (average) spatial distribution of secondary\nelectrons is anisotropic with the electron cloud elongated in the direction of\nthe primary impact. The maximal radius of the cascade is about 50 A at this\ntime. As the system cools, energy is distributed more equally, and the spatial\ndistribution of the electron cloud becomes isotropic. At 90 fs maximal radius\nis about 150 A. The Monte-Carlo model described here could be adopted for the\ninvestigation of radiation damage in other insulators and has implications for\nplanned experiments with intense femtosecond X-ray sources.",

We obtained spectra\ncovering redshifted H-alpha for 522 galaxies brighter than I=22.5, covering a\nfield of 8.7'X8.7'. We detect H-alpha emission in 46 of these galaxies;\naccounting for selection effects due to sampling and cluster membership, we\ndetermine that 24% of cluster members brighter than M_R=-16.5+5log(h) are\ndetected with H-alpha flux greater than 4h^{-2}X 10^{38} ergs/s. This\ncorresponds to a limiting star formation rate of 0.008 h^{-2} Msun/yr, assuming\n1 magnitude of dust extinction. From a Hubble Space Telescope mosaic covering\n7.5' X 10.0', we determine morphologies for 199 galaxies brighter than I=21,\nand find that 20% of the cluster members are of type Sa or later. More than 90%\nof cluster spirals show H-alpha emission, compared with less than 10% of E and\nS0 galaxies. The cluster H-alpha luminosity function has a low normalisation\nrelative to the z~0.2 field, by ~50%, after accounting for the different\nfraction of spiral galaxies in the two environments. When compared with local\nfield galaxies, this suggests that star formation activity is suppressed in\nearly-type cluster galaxies, relative to their field counterparts. Our sample\nincludes 29 galaxies previously observed with ISOCAM at 6 and 15 microns. We\ndetect all 15-micron sources at H-alpha, so there is no evidence for any star\nformation completely hidden at H-alpha. Comparing the 15-micron and H-alpha\nfluxes, we find evidence that some mid-infrared-detected galaxies could be\nobscured by as much as 3 magnitudes of extinction at H-alpha, although this\ndepends on the largely unknown contribution from any AGN-heated dust to the\nmid-infrared flux.",

The observations include 31 short pointings made by the Unconventional\nStellar Aspect (USA) Experiment on board the Advanced Research and Global\nObservation Satellite (ARGOS), and 17 pointings by the PCA on board the Rossi\nX-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). Most of these observations were spaced by less\nthan 1 day. \\es was detected by the ARGOS USA detector in the range 1-16 keV,\nand by the PCA in the 2-16 keV range but at different times. During the closely\nspaced RXTE observations beginning on 2000 July 28, an ending of one flare and\na start of another are visible, associated with spectral changes, where the\nphoton index Gamma ranges between ~ 1.4 and 1.7, and the spectrum is harder\nwhen the source is brighter. This implies that 1ES1959 is an XBL-type blazar,\nwith the X-ray emission likely to originate via the synchrotron process. The\nUSA observations reveal another flare that peaked on 2000 November 14 and\ndoubled the flux within a few days, again associated with spectral changes of\nthe same form. The spectral variability correlated with the flux and timing\ncharacteristics of this object that are similar to those of other nearby BL\nLacs, and suggest relativistic beaming with a Doppler factor delta > 1.6 and\nmagnetic fields of the order of a few mG. We also suggest that the steady\ncomponent of the X-ray emission -- present in this object as well as in other\nXBLs -- may be due to the large-scale relativistic jet (such as measured by\nChandra in many radio-loud AGN), but pointing very closely to our line of\nsight.",

    "summary": "We have compared the results from a model for the chemical evolution of an\nelliptical galaxy with initial luminous mass of 2x10^10 M_sun and effective\nradius of 2 kpc with the recent abundance determinations for the Lyman-break\ngalaxy MS 1512-cB58 at a redshift z=2.7276. After correcting the iron abundance\ndetermination for the presence of dust we concluded that the observed [Si/Fe],\n[Mg/Fe], [N/Fe] are consistent with our model when a galactic age between 20\nand 35 Myr is assumed. Moreover, the [N/O] ratio also suggests the same age.\nThis age is in very good agreement with other independent studies based on the\nanalysis of the spectral energy distribution suggesting that this object is\nyounger than 35 Myr. Therefore, we suggest that MS 1512-cB58 is a truly young\nnormal elliptical galaxy experiencing its main episode of star formation and\ngalactic wind.",

    "summary": "We have measured the equivalent width of the H-alpha emission line for 11006\ngalaxies brighter than M_b=-19 (LCDM) at 0.05<z<0.1 in the 2dF Galaxy Redshift\nSurvey (2dF), in the fields of seventeen known galaxy clusters. The limited\nredshift range ensures that our results are insensitive to aperture bias, and\nto residuals from night sky emission lines. We use these measurements to trace\nmustar, the star formation rate normalized to Lstar, as a function of distance\nfrom the cluster centre, and local projected galaxy density. We find that the\ndistribution of mustar steadily skews toward larger values with increasing\ndistance from the cluster centre, converging to the field distribution at\ndistances greater than ~3 times the virial radius. A correlation between star\nformation rate and local projected density is also found, which is independent\nof cluster velocity dispersion and disappears at projected densities below ~1\ngalaxy (brighter than M_b=-19) per Mpc^2. This characteristic scale corresponds\napproximately to the mean density at the cluster virial radius. The same\ncorrelation holds for galaxies more than two virial radii from the cluster\ncentre. We conclude that environmental influences on galaxy properties are not\nrestricted to cluster cores, but are effective in all groups where the density\nexceeds this critical value. The present day abundance of such systems, and the\nstrong evolution of this abundance, makes it likely that hierarchical growth of\nstructure plays a significant role in decreasing the global average star\nformation rate. Finally, the low star formation rates well beyond the\nvirialised cluster rule out severe physical processes, such as ram pressure\nstripping of disk gas, as being completely responsible for the variations in\ngalaxy properties with environment.",

We show that the value of the\nneutrino mass obtained in this way is fairly robust against variations in\npresently unknown quantities, like the amount of neutrino clustering, the\nuniversal radio background, and the extragalactic magnetic field, within their\nanticipated uncertainties. Much stronger systematics arises from different\npossible assumptions about the diffuse background of ordinary cosmic rays from\nunresolved astrophysical sources. In the most plausible case that these\nordinary cosmic rays are protons of extragalactic origin, one is lead to a\nrequired neutrino mass in the range 0.08 eV - 1.3 eV at the 68 % confidence\nlevel. This range narrows down considerably if a particular universal radio\nbackground is assumed, e.g. to 0.08 eV - 0.40 eV for a large one.

Magnetic and electronic key-quantities as the\nCurie-temperature and the quasiparticle density of states are derived with\npreviously tested many-body procedures. It is shown that the magnetic\nproperties can be interpreted exclusively in terms of the temperature-dependent\nelectronic quasiparticle structure. An extended RKKY theory leads to effective\nHeisenberg exchange integrals, which turn out to be functionals of the\nconduction electron selfenergy, getting therewith a remarkable temperature and\nband occupation dependence.\n  In a second step the model studies are combined with tight binding-LMTO\nbandstructure calculations in order to get for real ferromagnetic films\nquasiparticle densities of states and quasiparticle bandstructures. The\nproposed method avoids the double-counting of relevant interactions and takes\ninto account the correct symmetry of the atomic orbitals. Special results are\ngiven for thin ferromagnetic EuO (100) films. The Curie temperature\n$T_{\\textrm{C}}$ of the EuO film turns out to be strongly thickness-dependent,\nstarting from a very low value ($\\simeq 15K$) for the monolayer and reaching\nthe bulk value at about 30 layers.

This is essential because\nsuch binaries could play a critical role in calibrating the single-star stellar\nevolution theory. While they derived the effective temperature from their\nestimated spectral type, we infer metallicity-dependent Teffs from a minimizing\nmethod fitting the B-V, V-R and V-I colours. For this purpose, a grid of\n621,600 flux distributions were computed from the Basel Stellar Library (BaSeL\n2.2) of model-atmosphere spectra, and their theoretical colours compared with\nthe observed photometry. As a matter of fact, the BaSeL colours show a very\ngood agreement with the BVRI metallicity-dependent empirical calibrations of\nAlonso et al. (1996), temperatures being different by 3+-3 % in the range\n4000-8000 K for dwarf stars. Before deriving the metallicity-dependent Teff\nfrom the BaSeL models, we paid particular attention to the influence of\nreddening and stellar rotation. A comparison between the MExcess code and\nneutral hydrogen column density data shows a good agreement for the sample but\nwe point out a few directions where the MExcess model overestimates the E(B-V)\ncolour excess. Influence of stellar rotation on the BVRI colours can be\nneglected except for 5 stars with large vsini, the maximum effect on\ntemperature being less than 5%. Our final results are in good agreement with\nprevious spectroscopic determinations available for a few primary components,\nand with ten Brummelaar et al. below ~10,000 K. Nevertheless, we obtain an\nincreasing disagreement with their Teffs beyond 10,000 K.

The long exposure provided a very high quality\nspectrum that exhibits all the typical features of Seyfert 1s. The high energy\ncut-off of the intrinsic continuum, at E_c=340+560/-107 keV, was detected for\nthe first time in this object. During the observation the source showed modest\nflux variations (~ 20% in 2-10 keV) and spectral variability that can be\ncompletely explained by a change of the intrinsic slope \\Delta\\Gamma ~ 0.1. NGC\n3783 is one of the few Seyfert 1s that exhibits a soft emission component in\nthe BeppoSAX spectrum. This soft excess is well reproduced by a black body\ncomponent with temperature kT ~ 0.2 keV. A warm absorber is also required to\nfit the soft X-ray spectrum. Both reprocessing features, the Compton reflection\nhump and the Fe emission line, were detected in our observation. In addition to\na narrow iron line (as observed by Chandra) a broad component with sigma=0.72\n+1.28/-0.27 keV and EW=115+/-76 eV, is required to fit the line. The observed\nCompton hump and the Fe line are well reproduced with the ionized\n(lg(xi)=2.73+0.04/-0.05) disc reflection model of Ross & Fabian. In this case\nthe soft excess observed below 2 keV can be accounted for by the disc\nemissivity and no additional soft X-rays component is required to fit the\nspectrum.",

The emission is caused by\nradiative shocks created where the supernova blast wave strikes dense gas\nprotruding inward from the equatorial ring. We measure and tabulate line\nidentifications, fluxes and, in some cases, line widths and shifts. We compute\nflux correction factors to account for substantial interstellar line absorption\nof several emission lines. Nebular analysis shows that optical emission lines\ncome from a region of cool (T_e ~ 10^4 K) and dense (n_e ~ 10^6 cm^-3) gas in\nthe compressed photoionized layer behind the radiative shock. The observed line\nwidths indicate that only shocks with shock velocities V_s < 250 km/s have\nbecome radiative, while line ratios indicate that much of the emission must\nhave come from yet slower (V_s < 135 k/ms) shocks. We are able to fit the UV\nfluxes with an idealized radiative shock model consisting of two shocks (V_s =\n135 and 250 km/s). The observed UV flux increase with time can be explained by\nthe increase in shock surface areas as the blast wave overtakes more of the\nprotrusion. The observed flux ratios of optical to highly-ionized UV lines are\ngreater by a factor of ~ 2 -- 3 than predictions from the radiative shock\nmodels and we discuss the possible causes. We also present models for the\nobserved H-alpha line widths and profiles, which suggests that a chaotic flow\nexists in the photoionized regions of these shocks. We discuss what can be\nlearned with future observations of all the spots present on the equatorial\nring.",

They are based on the group\n$SU(4)_C \\times SU(2)_L \\times SU(2)_R$. The models are non-supersymmetric,\neven though SUSY is unbroken in the bulk. Baryon number is gauged and its\nanomalies are cancelled through a generalized Green-Schwarz mechanism. We also\ndiscuss models (PS-B class) which at low energy have the standard model\naugmented by an anomaly free U(1) symmetry and show that multibrane wrappings\ncorrespond to a trivial redefinition of the surviving global U(1) at low\nenergies. There are no colour triplet couplings to mediate proton decay and\nproton is stable. The models are compatible with a low string scale of energy\nless that 650 GeV and are directly testable at present or future accelerators\nas they predict the existence of light left handed weak fermion doublets at\nenergies between 90 and 246 GeV. The neutrinos get a mass through an\nunconventional see-saw mechanism. The mass relation $m_e = m_d$ at the GUT\nscale is recovered. Imposing supersymmetry at particular intersections\ngenerates non-zero Majorana masses for right handed neutrinos as well providing\nthe necessary singlets needed to break the surviving anomaly free U(1), thus\nsuggesting a gauge symmetry breaking method that can be applied in general\nleft-right symmetric models.",

In this way\nwe show that the self-repellent random walk large deviation rate function for\nthe empirical drift of the path converges to the self-repellent Brownian motion\nlarge deviation rate function after appropriate scaling with the interaction\nparameters. The method is considerably simpler than the approach followed in\nour earlier work, which was based on functional analytic arguments applied to\nvariational representations and only worked in a very limited number of\nsituations.\n  We consider two examples of a weak interaction limit: (1) vanishing\nself-repellence, (2) diverging step variance. In example (1), we recover our\nearlier scaling results for simple random walk with vanishing self-repellence\nand show how these can be extended to random walk with steps that have zero\nmean and a finite exponential moment. Moreover, we show that these scaling\nresults are stable against adding self-attraction, provided the self-repellence\ndominates. In example (2), we prove a conjecture by Aldous for the scaling of\nself-avoiding walk with diverging step variance.

Our results extend earlier work in which a law of large numbers,\nrespectively, a central limit theorem were derived. In the Edwards model a path\nof length $T$ receives a penalty $e^{-\\beta H_T}$, where $ H_T$ is the\nself-intersection local time of the path and $\\beta\\in(0,\\infty)$ is a\nparameter called the strength of self-repellence. We identify the rate function\nin the large deviation principle for the endpoint of the path as $\\beta^{\\frac\n23} I(\\beta^{-\\frac 13}\\cdot)$, with $I(\\cdot)$ given in terms of the principal\neigenvalues of a one-parameter family of Sturm-Liouville operators. We show\nthat there exist numbers $0<b^{**}<b^*<\\infty$ such that: (1) $I$ is linearly\ndecreasing on $[0,b^{**}]$; (2) $I$ is real-analytic and strictly convex on\n$(b^{**},\\infty)$; (3) $I$ is continuously differentiable at $b^{**}$; (4) $I$\nhas a unique zero at $b^*$. (The latter fact identifies $b^*$ as the asymptotic\ndrift of the endpoint.) The critical drift $b^{**}$ is associated with a\ncrossover in the optimal strategy of the path: for $b\\geq b^{**}$ the path\nassumes local drift $b$ during the full time $T$, while for $0\\leq b<b^{**}$ it\nassumes local drift $b^{**}$ during time $\\frac{b^{**}+b}{2b^{**}}T$ and local\ndrift $-b^{**}$ during the remaining time $\\frac{b^{**}-b}{2b^{**}}T$.

In this model heated neutron stars in a close binary\nsystem near their last stable orbit emit neutrinos at large luminosities (~\n10^53 ergs/sec). A fraction of these neutrinos will annihilate to form an\nelectron-positron pair plasma wind which will, in turn, expand and recombine to\nphotons which make the gamma-ray burst. We study neutrino annihilation and show\nthat a substantial fraction (~ 50%) of energy deposited comes from inter-star\nneutrinos, where each member of the neutrino pair originates from each neutron\nstar. Thus, in addition to the annihilation of neutrinos blowing off of a\nsingle star, we have a new source of baryon free energy that is deposited\nbetween the stars. To model the pair plasma wind between stars, we do\nthree-dimensional relativistic numerical hydrodynamic calculations.\n  Preliminary results are also presented of new, fully general relativistic\ncalculations of gravitationally attracting stars falling from infinity with no\nangular momentum.

    "summary": "Synchrotron x-ray powder diffraction measurements have been performed on\nunpoled ceramic samples of (1-x)PbMg(1/3)Nb(2/3)O3-xPbTiO3 (PMN-xPT) with 30%<=\nx<= 39% as a function of temperature around the morphotropic phase boundary\n(MPB), which is the line separating the rhombohedral and tetragonal phases in\nthe phase diagram. The experiments have revealed very interesting features\npreviously unknown in this or related systems. The sharp and well-defined\ndiffraction profiles observed at high and intermediate temperatures in the\ncubic and tetragonal phases, respectively, are in contrast to the broad\nfeatures encountered at low temperatures. These peculiar characteristics, which\nare associated with the monoclinic phase of MC-type previously reported by Kiat\net al and Singh et al., can only be interpreted as multiple coexisting\nstructures with MC as the major component. An analysis of the diffraction\nprofiles has allowed us to properly characterize the PMN-xPT phase diagram and\nto determine the stability region of the monoclinic phase, which extends from\nx= 31% to x= 37% at 20 K. The complex lansdcape of observed phases points to an\nenergy balance between the different PMN-xPT phases which is intrinsically much\nmore delicate than that of related systems such as PbZr(1-x)TixO3 or\n(1-x)PbZn(1/3)Nb(1/3)O3-xPbTiO3. These observations are in good accord with an\noptical study of x= 33% by Xu et al., who observed monoclinic domains with\nseveral different polar directions coexisting with rhombohedral domains, in the\nsame single crystal.",

    "summary": "Using the IRAM interferometer we have detected J=4-3 and 5-4 CO line emission\ntoward the radio quiet quasar PSS2322+1944. At a redshift of z_CO=4.1199 this\nis the fourth and strongest detection of CO at z>4. The velocity-integrated CO\nJ=4-3 and J=5-4 line fluxes are 4.21+-0.40 and 3.74+-0.56 Jy km/s, and the\nlinewidth is ~300 km/s. The CO J=10-9 line was searched for but not detected\nwith an upper intensity limit of 30 mJy. The 1.35 mm (250 mum rest wavelength)\ncontinuum flux density is 7.5+-1.3 mJy, in agreement with previous bolometer\nmeasurements at 1.2 mm with the 30-m IRAM telescope. The 3mm (580 mum rest\nwavelength) continuum is not detected with a 3 sigma upper limit of 0.7mJy. We\nalso report observations of the 450 mum continuum in PSS2322+1944 using the\nSCUBA array at the JCMT. The quasar was detected with a 450 mum flux density of\n79+-19mJy. At the angular resolution of 4.8\" x 2.1\" at 1.3mm and 6.2\" x 4.9\" at\n3.2 mm, the interferometer observations do not show evidence of spatial\nextension in the continuum or CO line emission. Assuming no gravitational\nmagnification, we estimate a molecular gas mass of ~2.5x10^11 M_sun. The\nmolecular gas is warm (40-100 K) and dense (10^3.5-10^4.1 cm^-3). The\ninfrared-to-CO luminosity ratio is ~185 L_sun/(K km/s pc^2), comparable to the\nvalues found for ultraluminous infrared galaxies. The detection of CO emission\nin this high redshift QSO provides further evidence that the radio emission and\nthe millimeter to submillimeter continuum emission are predominantly powered by\na starburst which is coeval with the AGN activity.",

    "summary": "We present a statistical system that can be used in the study of cluster\npopulations. The basis of our approach is the construction of synthetic cluster\ncolor-magnitude-radius diagrams (CMRDs), which we compare with the observed\ndata using a maximum likelihood calculation. This approach permits a relatively\neasy incorporation of incompleteness (a function of not only magnitude and\ncolor, but also radius), photometry errors and biases, and a variety of other\ncomplex effects into the calculation, instead of the more common procedure of\nattempting to correct for those effects.\n  We then apply this procedure to our NGC 3627 data from Paper I. We find that\nwe are able to successfully model the observed CMRD and constrain a number of\nparameters of the cluster population. We measure a power law mass function\nslope of alpha = -1.50 +/- 0.07, and a distribution of core radii centered at\nr_c = 1.53 +/- 0.15 pc. Although the extinction distribution is less\nconstrained, we measured a value for the mean extinction consistent with that\ndetermined in Paper I from the Cepheids.",

    "summary": "We present the results of recent multicolor photometric and high-resolution\nspectroscopic observations of the bright Be star Pi Aquarii. Observational data\ncollected from the literature were used to study the star's variations over the\nlast four decades. The star is identified with the IR sources F22227+0107 in\nthe IRAS Faint Point Source catalog and MSX5_G066.0066-44.7392 in the MSX\ncatalog. The variations in near-IR brightness of Pi Aqr are found to be among\nthe largest reported for Be stars. Since 1996, the star has shown only weak\nsigns of circumstellar emission, which has allowed us to refine the fundamental\nstellar parameters: A_V=0.15 mag., T_eff=24000K, log g=3.9, and M_V=-2.95 mag.\nA weak emission component of the H-alpha line has been detected during the\nrecent quasi-normal star phase. From analysis of the H-alpha line profiles, we\nfind anti-phased radial velocity variations of the emission component and the\nphotospheric absorption, with a period of 84.1 days and semi-amplitudes of\n101.4 and 16.7 km/s, respectively. This result suggests that Pi Aqr may be a\nbinary system consisting of stars with masses of M_1 sin^{3}i = 12.4 M_sun, M_2\nsin^{3}i = 2.0 M_sun. We also estimate the orbital inclination angle to be\nbetween 50 and 75 degrees. We suggest that the photometric, spectroscopic, and\npolarimetric variations observed during the second half of the 20th century may\nbe due to variable mass transfer between the binary components.",

The Fisher\ninformation matrix is evaluated numerically to show the bounds derived from a\ngiven redshift sample. We find that intermediate-redshift galaxies, such as the\nLuminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, can constrain\ncosmological parameters, including the cosmological constant, unexpectedly\nwell. The importance of the dense as well as deep sampling in designing\nredshift surveys is emphasized.",
