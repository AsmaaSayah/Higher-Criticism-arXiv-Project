The geometry of the Universe\nmay be determined robustly, and the classical cosmological parameters, such as\nthe cosmological constant, baryon density, and Hubble constant, may be\ndetermined as well. In addition, the ``inflationary observables,'' which\nparameterize the shapes and amplitudes of the primordial spectra of density\nperturbations and long-wavelength gravitational waves produced by inflation,\nmay also be measured and thus provide several new tests of inflation. Although\nmost attention has focussed on the more easily observed temperature\nanisotropies, recent work has shown that the CMB polarization provides a wealth\nof unique information that may be especially important for determination of the\ninflationary observables. Secondary anisotropies at small angular scales\nproduced by re-scattering of photons from partial reionization may be used to\nconstrain the ionization history of the Universe.",

The off-nuclear CO\nspectra also show the single-peaked broad component (FWHM $\\simeq$ 100 km\ns$^{-1}$). The single-peaked CO profiles of both the nuclear and off-nuclear\nregions may be explained if we introduce a CO gas disk with a velocity\ndispersion of $\\sim 100$ km s$^{-1}$. If this gas disk would be extended up to\na few kpc in radius, we may explain the wide line widths of the off-nuclear CO\nemission. Alternatively, we may attribute the off-nuclear CO emission to the\ngas associated with the superwind. However, if all the CO gas moves along the\nbiconical surface of the superwind, the CO spectra would show double-peaked\nprofiles. Hence, the single-peaked CO profiles of the off-nuclear regions may\nbe explained by an idea that the morphology and/or velocity field of the\nmolecular-gas superwind are more complex as suggested by hydrodynamical\nsimulations.",

    "summary": "We derive the implications for anisotropies in the cosmic microwave\nbackground following from a model of inflation in which a bare cosmological\nconstant is gradually screened by an infrared process in quantum gravity. The\nmodel predicts that the amplitude of scalar perturbations is $A_S = (2.0 \\pm\n.2) \\times 10^{-5}$, that the tensor-to-scalar ratio is $r \\approx 1.7 \\times\n10^{-3}$, and that the scalar and tensor spectral indices are $n \\approx .97$\nand $n_T \\approx -2.8 \\times 10^{-4}$, respectively. By comparing the model's\npower spectrum with the COBE 4-year RMS quadrupole, the mass scale of inflation\nis determined to be $M = (.72 \\pm .03) \\times 10^{16}~{\\rm GeV}$. At this scale\nthe model produces about $10^8$ e-foldings of inflation, so another prediction\nis $\\Omega = 1$.",

Our numerical\nresults, obtained by density-matrix renormalization techniques for systems of\nwidths up to L = 144, are in agreement with a $1/L^2$ correction in the partial\nwet regime. However at complete wetting we find a large range of surface fields\nand temperatures with a correction to scaling of type $1/L^{4/3}$. We show that\nthis term is generated by a {\\it thin} wetting layer whose free energy is\ndominated by the contacts with the wall.

Our focus here is on minimum matching problems, because\nthey are computationally tractable while both frustrated and disordered. We\nfirst study a mean field model taking the link lengths between points to be\nindependent random variables. For this model we find perfect agreement with the\nresults of a replica calculation. Then we study the case where the points to be\nmatched are placed at random in a d-dimensional Euclidean space. Using the mean\nfield model as an approximation to the Euclidean case, we show numerically that\nthe mean field predictions are very accurate even at low dimension, and that\nthe error due to the approximation is O(1/d^2). Furthermore, it is possible to\nimprove upon this approximation by including the effects of Euclidean\ncorrelations among k link lengths. Using k=3 (3-link correlations such as the\ntriangle inequality), the resulting errors in the energy density are already\nless than 0.5% at d>=2. However, we argue that the Euclidean model's 1/d series\nexpansion is beyond all orders in k of the expansion in k-link correlations.",

We estimate\nthat (a) the radio beaming fraction of young pulsars is roughly 50%, certainly\nmuch less than 100%, and (b) one neutron star is born in the Galaxy every ~90\nyears.

A timing solution including a (non-precessing)\nKeplerian orbit and timing noise (represented as a polynomial of fifth order in\ntime) provide a satisfactory fit to the data.

Likewise, the radio sizes of the lobe-dominated radio sources are\nbelieved to provide a useful statistical indicator of their ages. Using two\nhomogeneously observed (and processed) sets of lobe-dominated radio-loud\nquasars, taken from literature, we show that a positive correlation exists\nbetween the radio sizes of the quasars and the widths of their broad $H\\beta$\nemission lines, and this correlation is found to be significantly stronger than\nthe other well known correlations involving radio size. This statistical\ncorrelation is shown to be consistent with the largest (and, hence, very\npossibly the oldest) radio sources harboring typically an order-of-magnitude\nmore massive central engines, as compared to the physically smaller and, hence,\nprobably much younger radio sources.

These\nfeatures are thought to provide evidence for the presence of highly collimated\njets in these systems. No similar spectral signatures have been detected in the\nspectra of other short-period CVs. Here, we ask if this apparent absence of\n``jet lines'' in the spectra of most CVs already implies the absence of jets of\nthe kind that appear to be present in the SSSs and perhaps T Pyx, or whether\nthe current lack of jet detections in CVs can still be ascribed to\nobservational difficulties.\n  To answer this question, we derive a simple, approximate scaling relation\nbetween the expected equivalent widths (EWs) of the jet lines in both types of\nsystems and the accretion rate through the disk. We then use this relation to\npredict the strength of jet lines in the spectra of ``ordinary'' CVs, i.e.\nsystems characterized by somewhat lower accretion rates than T Pyx. Making the\nassumption that the features seen in T Pyx are indeed jet lines and using this\nsystem as a reference point, we find that if jets are present in many CVs, they\nmay be expected to produce satellite recombination lines with EWs of a few\nhundredths to a few tenths of Angstroms in suitably selected systems. A similar\nprediction is obtained if the SSS RX J0513-069 is used as a reference point.\nSuch EWs are small enough to account for the non-detection of jet features in\nCVs to date, but large enough to allow them to be detected in data of\nsufficiently high quality, if they exist.",

In the very low metallicity\n(i.e. [Fe/H] $<$ --2.0) stars, the abundance pattern of the elements from Ba\nthrough the third neutron-capture peak (Os-Pt) is consistent with a scaled\nsolar {\\it r}-process distribution. These results support previous observations\nthat demonstrate the operation of the {\\it r}-process, including the synthesis\nof the heaviest such elements, early in the history of the Galaxy. New\nground-based observations further confirm that the {\\it s}-process element Ba\nand the {\\it r}-process element Eu were both synthesized solely by the\nr-process at low metallicities, and indicate the onset of the {\\it s}-process\noccurred near [Fe/H] = --2. Over a range of metallicity (--2.90 $<$ [Fe/H] $<$\n--0.86) the data indicate that there exist real star-to-star differences in the\nratios of the [n-capture/Fe] abundances as well as in the actual spectra of the\nstars.",

Furthermore, the region of correlated\nseismicity predicted by this model is much greater than would be predicted from\nsimple elasto-dynamic interactions. We present a systematic procedure to test\nfor the accelerating seismicity predicted by the critical point model and to\nidentify the region approaching criticality, based on a comparison between the\nobserved cumulative energy (Benioff strain) release and the power-law behavior\npredicted by theory. This method is used to find the critical region before all\nearthquakes along the San Andreas system since 1950 with M 6.5. The statistical\nsignificance of our results is assessed by performing the same procedure on a\nlarge number of randomly generated synthetic catalogs. The null hypothesis,\nthat the observed acceleration in all these earthquakes could result from\nspurious patterns generated by our procedure in purely random catalogs, is\nrejected with 99.5% confidence. An empirical relation between the logarithm of\nthe critical region radius (R) and the magnitude of the final event (M) is\nfound, such that log R \\mu 0.5 M, suggesting that the largest probable event in\na given region scales with the size of the regional fault network.",

The topological quantum field theory\npart of the four-dimensional U(1) gauge theory is exactly equivalent to the\ntwo-dimensional O(2) nonlinear sigma model. The confining (resp.

Strong emission can be traced out to a radius of 20 arcsec and weaker\nemission extends out to 50 arcsec. With a luminosity of at least 10^{42} erg/s\nthis makes NGC 6240 one of the most luminous X-ray emitters in extended\nemission known. Evidence for a nuclear compact variable component is indicated\nby a drop of 32% in the HRI count rate as compared to the PSPC data taken one\nyear earlier. No short-timescale variability is detected. The HRI data, which\nrepresent the first high-resolution study of the X-ray emission from NGC 6240,\ncomplement previous spectral fits to ROSAT PSPC data (astro-ph/9710098; A&A\n330, 823) that suggested a two-component model consisting of thermal emission\nfrom shocked gas immersed in a starburst wind plus a powerlaw source attributed\nto scattered light from an obscured AGN.

The periods of the Cepheids are determined using\ntwo independent methods and the reasons for varying estimates are analyzed. The\nlog(period) vs V-magnitude relation is re-calibrated using LMC data as well as\navailable HST observations for three galaxies and the slope is found to be\n-3.45 +/- 0.15. A prescription to compute correction for the flux-limited\nincompleteness of the sample is given and a correction of 0 to 0.28 magnitude\nin V-magnitude for Cepheids in the period range of 35 to 45 days is applied.\nThe extinction correction is carried out using period vs mean (V-I) color and\nV-amplitude vs (V-I) color at the brightest phase relations.

Our study uses new polarimetric, optical, and spectral classification\ndata for 36 stars to carefully study the relation between polarization\npercentage (p) and extinction (A_V) in the Taurus dark cloud complex. We find\ntwo trends in our p-A_V study: (1) stars background to the warm ISM show an\nincrease in p with A_V; and (2) the percentage of polarization of stars\nbackground to cold dark clouds does not increase with extinction. We detect a\nbreak in the p-A_V relation at an extinction 1.3 +/- 0.2 mag, which we expect\ncorresponds to a set of conditions where the polarizing power of the dust\nassociated with the Taurus dark clouds drops precipitously. This breakpoint\nplaces important restrictions on the use of polarimetry in studying\ninterstellar magnetic fields.",

The average space velocity of a normal star\nin the Milky Way is only 30 km/s, which means that pulsars must receive a\nsubstantial 'kick' at birth. Here we propose that the birth characteristics of\npulsars have a simple physical connection with each other. Magnetic fields\nmaintained by differential rotation between the core and envelope of the\nprogenitor would keep the whole star in a state of approximately uniform\nrotation until 10 years before the explosion. Such a slowly rotating core has\n1000 times less angular momentum than required to explain the rotation of\npulsars. Although the specific physical process that 'kicks' the neutron star\nat birth has not been identified, unless its force is exerted exactly head-on,\nit will also cause the neutron star to rotate. We identify this process as the\norigin of the spin of pulsars. Such kicks will cause a correlation between the\nvelocity and spin vectors of pulsars. We predict that many neutron stars are\nborn with periods longer than 2 s, and never become radio pulsars.",

We define these to be AGN for which the direct line-of-sight to\nthe continuum source is obscured by Compton-thick material. The aim is to\nconstruct, for the first time, a model consistent with X-ray line luminosities,\nline ratios and various luminosity indicators. The ASCA spectra of six such\nsources show several X-ray lines that can be reliably measured, mostly due to\nhighly ionized magnesium, silicon sulphur and iron. These enable us to\ninvestigate the physical conditions of the scattering material. The sources\nshow evidence of He-like and H-like iron lines that are likely to be produced\nin hot (T approx 10^6 K) photoionized gas. By measuring the EW of the lines,\nand by constructing a diagnostic line-ratio diagram, we demonstrate that the\nsilicon and magnesium lines are produced by the same gas emitting the highly\nionized iron lines. The properties of this gas are rather different from the\nproperties of warm absorbers in type I AGN. Neutral 6.4 keV iron lines are also\ndetected, originating in a different component which can be either Compton-thin\nor Compton-thick. The best measured iron lines suggest an enhancement of\nn_{Fe}/n_H by a factor approx 2 compared to solar, in both the hot and cool\nCompton-thin components. We further show that in four of the sources, the Fe\nKalpha(6.4keV)/Hbeta (lambda 4861Ang) line ratio is consistent with that\npredicted for typical narrow line region clouds, and the reddening corrected\nHbeta is known, provided the column density is larger than approx\n10^{22.5}/cm^2, alpha_{ox} is smaller than 1.3. For some sources, this is a\nviable alternative to the commonly assumed Compton thick medium as the origin\nof the 6.4 keV iron line.",

Separating the influence into effects on the mean model and\neffects on the physics of the modes, we find that the main model effects are\ndue to the turbulent pressure that provides additional support against gravity,\nand thermal differences between average 3-D models and 1-D models. Surfaces of\nconstant pressure in the visible photosphere are elevated by about 150 km,\nrelative to a standard envelope model.\n  As a result, the turning points of high-frequency modes are raised, while\nthose of the low-frequency modes remain essentially unaffected. The\ncorresponding gradual lowering of the mode frequencies accounts for most of the\nfrequency difference between observations and standard solar models. Additional\neffects are expected to come primarily from changes in the physics of the\nmodes, in particular from the modulation of the turbulent pressure by the\noscillations.",

For weak, slowly varying electric fields\nthis particle number can be identified with the single particle distribution\nfunction in phase space, and its time rate of change is the appropriate\neffective source term for the Boltzmann-Vlasov equation. By analyzing the\nevolution of the particle number we exhibit the time structure of the particle\ncreation process in a constant electric field, and derive the local form of the\nsource term due to pair creation. In order to capture the secular Schwinger\ncreation rate, the source term requires an asymptotic expansion which is\nuniform in time, and whose longitudinal momentum dependence can be approximated\nby a delta function only on long time scales. The local Vlasov source term\namounts to a kind of Markov limit of field theory, where information about\nquantum phase correlations in the created pairs is ignored and a reversible\nHamiltonian evolution is replaced by an irreversible kinetic one. This\nreplacement has a precise counterpart in the density matrix description, where\nit corresponds to disregarding the rapidly varying off-diagonal terms in the\nadiabatic number basis and treating the more slowly varying diagonal elements\nas the probabilities of creating pairs in a stochastic process.

Applying the Geometric Test for dark matter, which is\nindependent of the gas temperature profile, we find that the ellipticities of\nthe PSPC isophotes exceed those predicted if M propto L at a marginal\nsignificance level of 85% (80%) for oblate (prolate) symmetry. Detailed\nhydrostatic models of an isothermal gas yield ellipticities for the gravitating\nmatter, e_mass=0.35-0.66 (90% confidence), which exceed the intensity weighted\nellipticity of the R-band optical light, <e_R> = 0.30 (e_R^max=0.39).\n  We conclude that mass density profiles with rho\\sim r^{-2} are favored over\nsteeper profiles if the gas is essentially isothermal (which is suggested by\nthe PSPC spectrum) and the surface brightness in the central regions (r<~15\")\nis not modified substantially by a multi-phase cooling flow, magnetic fields,\nor discrete sources. We argue that these effects are unlikely to be important\nfor NGC 3923. (The derived e_{mass} range is very insensitive to these issues.)\nOur spatial analysis also indicates that the allowed contribution to the ROSAT\nemission from a population of discrete sources with Sigma_x propto Sigma_R is\nsignificantly less than that indicated by the hard spectral component measured\nby ASCA.",

From the theoretical point of\nview, it would be interesting to study the consequence of conflicting effects:\nthe parameter p, which increases the first-order phase-transition region, and\ndisorder in the crystal field, which tends to diminish this region in three\ndimensions. In order to study this competition in high-dimensional systems, we\napply a mean-field approximation: it is then possible to determine the critical\nbehavior of the random DBEG model for any value of the interaction parameters.\nFinally, we comment on (preliminary) results obtained for a two-dimensional\nsystem, where the randomness in the crystal-field has a more drastic effect,\nwhen compared to the three-dimensional model.",

The approach is a development of that adopted by Braginsky and\nKhalili in the case of a single measurement of position only. A distinction is\nmade between the errors of retrodiction and the errors of prediction. Two\nerror-error relationships and four error-disturbance relationships are derived,\nsupplementing the Uncertainty Principle usually so-called.

We show, both with analytic arguments and numerically, that there is a sharp\ntransition, at a critical symmetry $\\e_c=0.33$, between a phase where the\ntypical cycles have length 2 and basins of attraction of vanishing weight and a\nphase where the typical cycles are exponentially long with system size, and the\nweights of their attraction basins are distributed as in a Random Map with\nreversal symmetry. The time-scale after which cycles are reached grows\nexponentially with system size $N$, and the exponent vanishes in the symmetric\nlimit, where $T\\propto N^{2/3}$. The transition can be related to the dynamics\nof the infinite system (where cycles are never reached), using the closing\nprobabilities as a tool.\n  We also study the relaxation of the function $E(t)=-1/N\\sum_i |h_i(t)|$,\nwhere $h_i$ is the local field experienced by the neuron $i$. In the symmetric\nsystem, it plays the role of a Ljapunov function which drives the system\ntowards its minima through steepest descent. This interpretation survives, even\nif only on the average, also for small asymmetry. This acts like an effective\ntemperature: the larger is the asymmetry, the faster is the relaxation of $E$,\nand the higher is the asymptotic value reached. $E$ reachs very deep minima in\nthe fixed points of the dynamics, which are reached with vanishing probability,\nand attains a larger value on the typical attractors, which are cycles of\nlength 2.",

It is shown that a high precision in the description\nof the charge density variations over the interstitial region in perovskite\nmaterials is essential; the technical limitations of the accuracy of\ncharge-density description apparently accounted for previously reported slight\ndisagreement with the LAPW results. With more accurate description of the\ncharge density by sufficiently fine real-space grid, the results obtained by\nboth methods became almost identical.\n  In order to extract additional information (beyond the harmonic\napproximation) from the total energy fit obtainable in total-energy\ncalculations, a scheme is proposed to solve the multidimensional vibrational\nSchroedinger equation in the model of non-interacting anharmonic oscillators\nvia the expansion in hyperspherical harmonics.",

The models\npredict how the power law slope should depend on the maximum age of the stellar\nsample and the average star formation rate, although a number of effects\npreclude a comparison with currently-available data. We also show how stellar\nmigration flattens the power law slope below a scale that depends on the\nvelocity dispersion and age of the sample, an effect which may explain the\nsecondary breaks in the observed correlation functions of some regions at large\nseparations. Problems with using the correlation function as a descriptor of\nclustering structure for statistically inhomogeneous data sets are discussed.",

The\nprediction is quantitative, depending on the mass and the depth of the troughs,\nwhich can be tested in large N-body simulations. As an illustration of the\nmagnitude of the effect we calculate the constrained mass function for the CDM\nmodel with Gamma = Omega h = 0.25 normalized to sigma_{8} = 1. In particular,\nwe show that the probability of finding a clump of mass 10^{14} -\n10^{15}h^{-1}M_{odot} in the region of negative initial potential is 1.3 - 3\ntimes greater (depending on the mass) than that in the region of\npositiveinitial potential. The scale of the potential fluctuations\nR_{varphi}=sqrt{3} sigma_{varphi}/sigma_{varphi'} is shown to be approx 120\nh^{-1} Mpc for the spectrum in question.

We also investigate the metallicity distributions of these\nstars, and show that there are distinct trends according to the chromospheric\nactivity level. Inactive stars have a metallicity distribution which resembles\nthe metallicity distribution of solar neighbourhood stars (Rocha-Pinto & Maciel\n1996), while active stars appear to be concentrated in an activity strip on the\nlog R'HK - [Fe/H] diagram.

The analysis\nand interpretation of the results is complicated by the fact that 4 of these\nobservations were used for on-board calibration of the CCDs spectral response.\n  The present analysis shows that, in agreement with official recommendations,\na conservative systematic error (at low energies) of about 2-3 x 10**20cm-2\nmust be assumed when analyzing ASCA SIS data. A soft-excess, with variable flux\nand/or shape, has been clearly detected as well as flux and spectral\nvariability. An anti-correlation is found between the spectral index and the\nflux in the 2-10 keV energy range. Fitting the data with the latest available\ncalibration matrices, we also detect an emission line at ~5.4-5.7 keV (~6.3-6.6\nkeV in the quasar frame) in (only) the two observations with lowest fluxes\nwhere it is weak (EW ~ 20-30 eV), narrow and consistent with being produced by\nFe K emission from neutral matter.\n  Overall, the observations are qualitatively consistent with a variable,\nnon-thermal X-ray continuum emission, i.e., a power law with Gamma~1.6\n(possibly produced in the innermost regions of the radio-optical jet), plus\nunderlying ``Seyfert-like'' features, i.e., a soft-excess and Fe K line\nemission due to a reflection component. When the continuum (jet) emission is in\na low state, the spectral features produced by the Seyfert-like spectrum\n(soft-excess, iron line and possibly a steep power law plus reflection\ncontinuum) are more easily seen.",

The time average of the\nstructure, which is defined with respect to the active spot of growth, defines\nan activity-centered pattern. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations show that the\npattern has a tail which decays slowly, as a power law. To understand this sort\nof pattern formation, we write down an approximate integral equation involving\nthe local interface dynamics and long-ranged jumps of the growth spot.

The pattern, which defines a\none-point correlation function, is shown to have a strong effect on ordinary\nspace-fixed two-point correlation functions. Finally we present evidence that\nthis sort of pattern formation is not confined to the interface problem, but is\ngeneric to situations in which the activity at succesive time steps is\ncorrelated, as for instance in several other extremal models.

Convincing identification of\nblack holes must necessarily depend on the identification of a very specially\nbehaving matter and radiation which surround them. A major problem in this\nsubject of black hole astrophysics is to quantify the behaviour of matter and\nradiation close to the horizon. In this review, the subject of black hole\naccretion and outflow is systematically developed.

It is suggested that the\nsolutions of radiative hydrodynamic equations may produce clear spectral\nsignatures of black holes.

We obtain, as result, that the free self-dual model is\na relativistically invariant quantum field theory whose excitations are\nidentical to the physical (gauge invariant) excitations of the free\nMaxwell-Chern-Simons theory. The model describing the interaction of the\nself-dual field minimally coupled to fermions is also quantized through the\nDirac bracket quantization procedure. One of the self-dual field components is\nfound not to commute, at equal times, with the fermionic fields. Hence, the\nformulation of the interaction picture dynamics is only possible after the\nelimination of the just mentioned component. This procedure brings, in turns,\ntwo new interaction terms, which are local in space and time while\nnon-renormalizable by power counting. Relativistic invariance is tested in\nconnection with the elastic fermion-fermion scattering amplitude. We prove that\nall the non-covariant pieces in the interaction Hamiltonian are equivalent to\nthe covariant minimal interaction of the self-dual field with the fermions. The\nhigh energy behavior of the self-dual field propagator corroborates that the\ncoupled theory is non-renormalizable. Certainly, the self-dual field minimally\ncoupled to fermions bears no resemblance with the renormalizable model defined\nby the Maxwell-Chern-Simons field minimally coupled to fermions.",

    "summary": "We show that fermion systems with random interactions lead to strong coupling\nof glassy order and fermionic correlations, which culminates in the\nimplementation of Parisi replica permutation symmetry breaking (RPSB) in their\nT=0 quantum field theories. Precursor effects below fermionic AT-lines become\nstronger as the temperature decreases and play a crucial role within the entire\nlow T regime. The Parisi ultrametric structure is shown to determine low energy\nexcitations and the dynamic behaviour of fermionic correlations for large\ntimes, which is predicted to affect transport properties in metallic (and\nsuperconducting) spin glasses. Thus we reveal quantum dynamical fingerprints of\nthe Parisi scheme. These effects, being strongest as T->0, are contrasted with\nquantum spin glass transitions at T=0 displaying only small RPSB corrections at\nlow T. RPSB-effects moreover appear to influence the loci of the ground state\ntransitions at O(T^0) and hence the phase diagrams. We derive a new\nrepresentation of the T=0 Green's function which leads to a map of the\nfermionic (insulating) spin glass solution to the local limit solution of a\nHubbard model with a random repulsive interaction. We obtain the distribution\nof the Hubbard interaction fluctuation and its dependence on the order of RPSB.\nA generalized mapping between metallic spin glass and random U Hubbard model is\nconjectured. The new representation of the Green's function at T=0 is suggested\nto be useful for generalizations to superconductors with spin glass phases.",

The change\nin exponents affects the recently determined ratios of amplitudes and we report\nthe corresponding new values. Finally, because an error has been discovered in\nthe last order of the published epsilon=4-d expansions (order epsilon^5), we\nhave also reanalyzed the determination of exponents from the epsilon-expansion.\nThe conclusion is that the general agreement between epsilon-expansion and 3D\nseries has improved with respect to Le Guillou--Zinn-Justin.",

We confirm that metallicity effects must play a role in the\norigin of the slope of the color-magnitude relation for cluster early-type\ngalaxies. We show, however, that the small scatter of the color-magnitude\nrelation out to redshifts z=1 does not formally imply a common epoch of major\nstar formation for all early-type galaxies. Instead, it requires that galaxies\nassembling more recently be on average more metal-rich than older galaxies of\nsimilar luminosity. Regardless of the true ages and metallicities of early-type\ngalaxies within the allowed range, their photometric properties and the implied\nstrengths of several commonly used spectral indices are found to be consistent\nwith apparently passive evolution of the stellar populations. Also, the implied\ndependence of the mass-to-light ratio on galaxy luminosity is consistent with\nthe observed trend.

At energies $E_{lab}$ below\napproximately 30 MeV $A_y$ cannot be described by any realistic NN force. The\ninclusion of existing three-nucleon forces does not improve the situation.\nBecause of recent questions about the $^3P_J$ NN phases, we examine whether\nreasonable changes in the NN force can resolve the puzzle. In order to do this\nwe investigate the effect on the $^3P_J$ waves produced by changes in different\nparts of the potential (viz., the central force, tensor force, etc.), as well\nas on the 2-body observables and on $A_y$. We find that it is not possible with\nreasonable changes in the NN potential to increase the 3-body $A_y$ and at the\nsame time to keep the 2-body observables unchanged. We therefore conclude that\nthe $A_y$ puzzle is likely to be solved by new three-nucleon forces, such as\nthose of spin-orbit type, which have not yet been taken into account.",

We consider the range\n$\\delta=3/2$ (isothermal disks) to $\\delta=-3/2$, which corresponds to a\nradiation-pressure-supported disk; this spans the range of surface density\ndistributions likely to be found in real astrophysical disks. There is a\ncritical minimum size for unstable disks. The critical radius and the\nsteady-state precession rate depend only weakly on $\\delta$. The case\n$\\delta=1$ divides the solutions into two qualitatively different regimes.\nNonlinear effects must be important if the warp extends to the disk inner edge\nfor $\\delta \\ge 1$, but for $\\delta < 1$ nonlinearity will be important only if\nthe warp amplitude is large at the origin. The effects of shadowing of the\ncentral source by the warp will thus be very different in the two regimes of\n$\\delta.$ In real accretion disks the outer boundary condition is likely to be\ndifferent from the zero-crossing condition that we have assumed. In accretion\ndisks around massive black holes in active galactic nuclei, the disk will\nprobably become optically thin before the outer disk boundary is reached, while\nin X-ray binaries, there will be an outer disk region (outside the\ncircularization radius) in which the inflow velocity is zero but angular\nmomentum is still transported.

The\nresulting cavity offers to water a rough hydrophilic surface and its geometry\nand size are similar to those of a typical pore in porous Vycor glass.

    "summary": "We have developed 1D time-dependent numerical models of accretion discs,\nusing an adaptive grid technique and an implicit numerical scheme, in which the\ndisc size is allowed to vary with time. The code fully resolves the cooling and\nheating fronts propagating in the disc. We show that models in which the radius\nof the outer edge of the disc is fixed produce incorrect results, from which\nprobably incorrect conclusions about the viscosity law have been inferred. In\nparticular we show that outside-in outbursts are possible when a standard\nbimodal behaviour of the Shakura-Sunyaev viscosity parameter alpha is used. We\nalso discuss to what extent insufficient grid resolutions have limited the\npredictive power of previous models. We find that the global properties\n(magnitudes, etc. ...) of transient discs can be addressed by codes using a\nhigh, but reasonable, number of fixed grid points. However, the study of the\ndetailed physical properties of the transition fronts generally requires\nresolutions which are out of reach of fixed grid codes. It appears that most\ntime-dependent models of accretion discs published in the literature have been\nlimited by resolution effects, improper outer boundary conditions, or both.",

    "summary": "We investigate both numerically and analytically the convective instability\nof granular materials by two dimensional traffic equations. In the absence of\nvibrations the traffic equations assume two distinctive classes of fixed bed\nsolutions with either a spatially uniform or nonuniform density profile. The\nformer one exists only when the function V(\\rho) that monitors the relaxation\nof grains assumes a cut off at the closed packed density, \\rho_c, with\nV(\\rho_c)=0, while the latter one exists for any form of V. Since there is\nlittle difference between the uniform and nonuniform solution deep inside the\nbed, the convective instability of the bulk may be studied by focusing on the\nstability of the uniform solution. In the presence of vibrations, we find that\nthe uniform solution bifurcates into a bouncing solution, which then undergoes\na supercritical bifurcation to the convective instability. We determine the\nonset of convection as a function of control parameters and confirm this\npicture by solving the traffic equations numerically, which reveals bouncing\nsolutions, two convective rolls, and four convective rolls. Further, convective\npatterns change as the aspect ratio changes: in a vertically long container,\nthe rolls move toward the surface, and in a horizontally long container, the\nrolls move toward the walls. We compare these results with those reported\npreviously with a different continuum model by Hayakawa, Yue and Hong[Phys.\nRev. Lett. 75,2328, 1995]. Finally, we also present a derivation of the traffic\nequations from Enskoq equation.",

The observation\nstrategy has been carefully designed to provide even sampling on these three\nbasic timescales and to provide a uniform sampling among the quasars We have\nfound clear evidence that the X-ray steep, narrow H_beta, quasars\nsystematically show larger amplitude variations than the X-ray flat broad\nH_beta quasars on timescales from 2 days to 20 days.

Assuming that GRBs trace the\ncosmic star formation history and that every GRB gives rise to a bright\nafterglow, we find that the average detection rate of supernovae and afterglows\nshould be comparable at limiting magnitudes brighter than K=18. The actual rate\nof afterglows is expected to be somewhat lower since only a fraction of all\ngamma-ray selected GRBs were observed to have associated afterglows. However,\nthe rate could also be higher if the initial gamma-ray emission from GRB\nsources is more beamed than their late afterglow emission. Hence, current and\nfuture supernova searches can place strong constraints on the afterglow\nappearance fraction and the initial beaming angle of GRB sources.",

As part of\nthis analysis, we show that measuring the two-meson decay of a photoproduced\n$\\rho$ or $\\phi$ does not determine the vector meson's vector polarization, but\nonly its tensor polarization. The vector meson decay into lepton pairs is also\ninsensitive to the vector meson's vector polarization, unless one measures the\nspin of one of the leptons. Similar results are found for all double spin\nobservables which involve observation of vector meson decay. To access the\nvector meson's vector polarization, one therefore needs to either measure the\nspin of the decay leptons, make an analysis of the background interference\neffects or relate the vector meson's vector polarization to other accessible\nspin observables.",

    "summary": "Existing plan synthesis approaches in artificial intelligence fall into two\ncategories -- domain independent and domain dependent. The domain independent\napproaches are applicable across a variety of domains, but may not be very\nefficient in any one given domain. The domain dependent approaches need to be\n(re)designed for each domain separately, but can be very efficient in the\ndomain for which they are designed. One enticing alternative to these\napproaches is to automatically synthesize domain independent planners given the\nknowledge about the domain and the theory of planning. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the feasibility of using existing automated software synthesis\ntools to support such synthesis. Specifically, we describe an architecture\ncalled CLAY in which the Kestrel Interactive Development System (KIDS) is used\nto derive a domain-customized planner through a semi-automatic combination of a\ndeclarative theory of planning, and the declarative control knowledge specific\nto a given domain, to semi-automatically combine them to derive\ndomain-customized planners. We discuss what it means to write a declarative\ntheory of planning and control knowledge for KIDS, and illustrate our approach\nby generating a class of domain-specific planners using state space\nrefinements. Our experiments show that the synthesized planners can outperform\nclassical refinement planners (implemented as instantiations of UCP,\nKambhampati & Srivastava, 1995), using the same control knowledge. We will\ncontrast the costs and benefits of the synthesis approach with conventional\nmethods for customizing domain independent planners.",

We show how the ADtree can be used to accelerate Bayes net\nstructure finding algorithms, rule learning algorithms, and feature selection\nalgorithms, and we provide a number of empirical results comparing ADtree\nmethods against traditional direct counting approaches.

The\ntheory patching problem is to revise only the indicated components of the\ntheory, such that the resulting theory correctly classifies all the training\nexamples. Theory patching is thus a type of theory revision in which revisions\nare made to individual components of the theory. Our concern in this paper is\nto determine for which classes of logical domain theories the theory patching\nproblem is tractable. We consider both propositional and first-order domain\ntheories, and show that the theory patching problem is equivalent to that of\ndetermining what information contained in a theory is `stable' regardless of\nwhat revisions might be performed to the theory. We show that determining\nstability is tractable if the input theory satisfies two conditions: that\nrevisions to each theory component have monotonic effects on the classification\nof examples, and that theory components act independently in the classification\nof examples in the theory. We also show how the concepts introduced can be used\nto determine the soundness and completeness of particular theory patching\nalgorithms.",

    "summary": "Recently it has been realized that the production and decay processes of\ncharginos, neutralinos, and sleptons receive corrections which grow like log\nm_squark for large m_squark. In this paper we calculate the chargino pair\nproduction cross section at e+e- colliders with quark/squark loop corrections.\nWe introduce a novel formulation, where the one-loop amplitude is reorganized\ninto two parts. One part is expressed in terms of the ``effective'' chargino\ncoupling gbar and mixing matrices U^P, V^P, and includes all O(log m_squark)\ncorrections, while the other decouples for large m_squark. The form of the\none-loop cross section then becomes physically transparent. Our formulation can\nbe easily extended to other loops and processes. Numerically, we find\nsignificant corrections due to the effective t-channel coupling gbar, for\ngaugino-like charginos. In the mixed region, where the chargino has large\ngaugino and Higgsino components, the corrections due to (U^P,V^P) are also\nsignificant. Our numerical results disagree with a previous calculation. We\nrevisit previous studies of the determination of gbar through the measurement\nof the chargino production cross section. We point out that a previous study,\nwhich claimed that the measurement suffers large systematic errors, was\nperformed at a ``pessimistic'' point in MSSM parameter space. We provide\nreasons why the systematic errors are not a limiting factor for generic\nparameter choices.",

For\nexternal fields like the electromagnetic or gravitational field there appears a\nquantity, the radiation moment, that governs both the classical radiation of\nwaves and the quantum particle production.

    "summary": "A generally relativistic theory of thermodynamics is developed, based on four\nmain physical principles: heat is a local form of energy, therefore described\nby a thermal energy tensor; conservation of mass, equivalent to conservation of\nheat, or the local first law; entropy is a local current; and non-destruction\nof entropy, or the local second law. A fluid is defined by the thermostatic\nenergy tensor being isotropic. The entropy current is related to the other\nfields by certain equations, including a generalised Gibbs equation for the\nthermostatic entropy, followed by linear and quadratic terms in the dissipative\n(thermal minus thermostatic) energy tensor. Then the second law suggests\ncertain equations for the dissipative energy tensor, generalising the Israel-\nStewart dissipative relations, which describe heat conduction and viscosity\nincluding relativistic effects and relaxation effects. In the thermostatic\ncase, the perfect-fluid model is recovered. In the linear approximation for\nentropy, the Eckart theory is recovered. In the quadratic approximation for\nentropy, the theory is similar to that of Israel & Stewart, but involving\nneither state-space differentials, nor a non-equilibrium Gibbs equation, nor\nnon-material frames. Also, unlike conventional thermodynamics, the thermal\nenergy density is not assumed to be purely thermostatic, though this is derived\nin the linear approximation. Otherwise, the theory reduces in the non-\nrelativistic limit to the extended thermodynamics of irreversible processes due\nto Mueller. The dissipative energy density seems to be a new thermodynamical\nfield, but also exists in relativistic kinetic theory of gases.",

We also discuss conserved models for\nwhich different scaling are shown to arise depending on the value of the\nautocorrelation exponent \\lambda.

By a redefinition of the electromagnetic field, the\nUehling term is shown not to contribute. The Stefan-Boltzmann energy density is\nthus found to be modified by a term proportional with $T^8/m^4$ in agreement\nwith the semi-classical result of Barton.

Similarly, the correction to the energy density\nof the vacuum between two metallic parallel plates diverges like $1/m^4z^8$ at\na distance from one of the plates $z \\to 0$. While the integral of the\nregularized energy density is thus divergent, the regularized integral is\nfinite and corresponds to a correction to the Casimir force which varies with\nthe separation $L$ between the plates as $1/m^4L^8$.

This construction has been extended to the theory of Hopf algebras.\nGiven an action of a Hopf algebra $A$ on an algebra $R$, it is possible to make\nthe tensor product $R\\ot A$ into an algebra by using a twisted product,\ninvolving the action. In this case, the algebra is called the smash product and\ndenoted by $R# A$. In the group case, the action $\\alpha$ of $G$ on $R$ yields\nan action of the group algebra $\\Bbb C G$ as a Hopf algebra on $R$ and the\ncrossed $R\\times_\\alpha G$ coincides with the smash product $R# \\Bbb C G$. In\nthis paper we extend the theory of actions of Hopf algebras to actions of\nmultiplier Hopf algebras. We also construct the smash product and we obtain\nresults very similar as in the original situation for Hopf algebras. The main\nresult in the paper is a duality theorem for such actions. We consider dual\npairs of multiplier Hopf algebras to formulate this duality theorem. We prove a\nresult in the case of an algebraic quantum group and its dual. The more general\ncase is only stated and will be proven in a separate paper on coactions. These\nduality theorems for actions are substantial generalizations of the\ncorresponding theorem for Hopf algebras.

    "summary": "It has been proposed to make practical use of chaos in communication, in\nenhancing mixing in chemical processes and in spreading the spectrum of\nswitch-mode power suppies to avoid electromagnetic interference. It is however\nknown that for most smooth chaotic systems, there is a dense set of periodic\nwindows for any range of parameter values. Therefore in practical systems\nworking in chaotic mode, slight inadvertent fluctuation of a parameter may take\nthe system out of chaos. We say a chaotic attractor is robust if, for its\nparameter values there exists a neighborhood in the parameter space with no\nperiodic attractor and the chaotic attractor is unique in that neighborhood. In\nthis paper we show that robust chaos can occur in piecewise smooth systems and\nobtain the conditions of its occurrence. We illustrate this phenomenon with a\npractical example from electrical engineering.",

    "summary": "Since their discovery in 1973, Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) have remained for many\nyears one of the most elusive mysteries in High Energy-Astrophysics. The main\nproblem regarding the nature of GRBs has usually been the lack of knowledge of\ntheir distance scale. About 300 GRBs are detected annually by BATSE in the full\nsky, but only a few of them can be localized accurately to less than half a\ndegree. For many years, follow-up observations by other satellites and\nground-based telescopes were conducted, but no counterparts at other\nwavelengths were found. The breakthrough took place in 1997, thanks to the\nobservation by BeppoSAX and RossiXTE of the fading X-ray emission that follows\nthe more energetic gamma-ray photons once the GRB event has ended. This\nemission (the afterglow) extends at longer wavelengths, and the good accuracy\nin the position determination by BeppoSAX has led to the discovery of the first\noptical counterparts -for GRB 970228, GRB 970508, and GRB 971214-, greatly\nimproving our understanding of these puzzling sources. Now it is widely\naccepted that most bursts originate at cosmological distances but the final\nsolution of the GRB problem is still far away.",

Unfortunately, a widely accepted proof of its\nsecurity in the presence of source, device and channel noises has been missing.\nThis long-standing problem is solved here by showing that, given fault-tolerant\nquantum computers, quantum key distribution over an arbitrarily long distance\nof a realistic noisy channel can be made unconditionally secure. The proof is\nreduced from a noisy quantum scheme to a noiseless quantum scheme and then from\na noiseless quantum scheme to a noiseless classical scheme, which can then be\ntackled by classical probability theory.",

Our scheme assigns significantly different probabilities for the\ndifferent polarization bases during both transmission and reception to reduce\nthe fraction of discarded data. The actual probabilities used in the scheme are\nannounced in public. As the number of transmitted signals increases, the\nefficiency of our scheme can be made to approach 100%. An eavesdropper may try\nto break such a scheme by eavesdropping mainly along the predominant basis. To\ndefeat such an attack, we perform a refined analysis of accepted data: Instead\nof lumping all the accepted data together to estimate a single error rate, we\nseparate the accepted data into various subsets according to the basis employed\nand estimate an error rate for each subset {\\it individually}.",

    "summary": "Metal line ratios in a sample of 13 quasar spectra obtained with the HIRES\nspectrograph on the KeckI telescope have been analyzed to characterize the\nevolution of the metagalactic ionizing flux near a redshift of 3. The evolution\nof SiIV/CIV has been determined using three different techniques: using total\ncolumn densities of absorption line complexes, as in Songaila & Cowie (1996);\nusing the column densities of individual Voigt profile components within\ncomplexes; and using direct optical depth ratios. All three methods show that\nSiIV/CIV changes abruptly at a redshift near 3, requiring a jump in value of\nabout a factor of 3.4, and indicating a significant change in the ionizing\nspectrum that occurs rapidly between z = 2.9 and z = 3, just above the redshift\nat which Reimers et al. (1997) detected patchy HeII Lyman alpha absorption. At\nlower redshifts, the ionization balance is consistent with a pure power law\nionizing spectrum but at higher redshifts the spectrum must be very soft, with\na large break at the He+ edge. An optical depth ratio technique is used to\nmeasure the abundances of ions whose transitions lie within the forest and\nCIII, SiIII and OVI are detected in this way. The presence of a significant\namount of OVI at z > 3 suggests either a considerable volume of HeIII bubbles\nembedded in the more general region where the ionizing flux is heavily broken,\nor the addition of collisional ionization to the simple photoionization models.",

Spectra of the objects found in narrowband-selected\nsamples at lambda ~5390 Angstroms and ~6741 Angstroms show that these very high\nequivalent width emission lines are generally redshifted Lyman alpha 1216\nAngstrom at z~3.4 and 4.5.

We also\nindicate that as the final state would be approached, the curvature components\ntend to blow up, and the proper radial distance $l$ and the proper time $\\tau\n\\to \\infty$. This indicates that actually the singularity is never attained for\nthe collapse of an isolated body. We also identify that, the final state may\ncorrespond to the local 3-speed $v\\to c$, eventhough the circumference speed\n$U\\to 0$. However, at a finite observation epoch, such Eternally Collapsing\nObjects (ECOs) may have a modest local speed of collapse $v \\ll c$, and the lab\nframe speed of collapse should practically be zero because of their extremely\nhigh surface gravitational red-shifts.",

We briefly summarize results which support that the\nmodel exhibits s-wave superconductivity for certain parameters and extend them\nby studying the Berry phases. Using a generalized Hartree-Fock(HF) BCS\ndecoupling of the two and three-body terms, we obtain that at half filling, for\nt_{AB}<t_{AA}=t_{BB} and sufficiently small U and V the model leads to triplet\np-wave superconductivity for a simple cubic lattice in any dimension. In one\ndimension, the resulting phase diagram is compared with that obtained\nnumerically using two quantized Berry phases (topological numbers) as order\nparameters.

    "summary": "In observations with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer we have discovered\nquasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) near 1 kHz from 4U 1705-44, a low--mass\nX-ray binary with a neutron star classified as an atoll source. In six separate\nobservations, we detect one QPO with a frequency ranging between 770 and 870 Hz\nand a 4% rms fraction in the full detector energy band. There is evidence for a\nsecond QPO at 1073 Hz in one interval. The separation in frequency of the two\nQPOs is 298+-11 Hz. The QPOs are present only in observations where the mass\naccretion rate is inferred to be at an intermediate level, based on the atoll\nsource phenomenology. At the highest accretion rates, the QPOs are not detected\nwith upper limits to the rms fraction of about 2%. At the lowest accretion\nrates the upper limits are about 4%. The QPO frequency increases with inferred\nmass accretion rate. This is expected in models where the QPO frequency is\ngenerated by motion at an inner edge of the accretion disk. An increased mass\naccretion rate causes the disk edge to move in, increasing the orbital\nfrequency. Five Type-I X-ray bursts are observed with no detectable\noscillations.",

In most cases, the near-IR data sample rest\nwavelengths at ~4000 Angstroms, free of strong emission lines. At z > 3, the\nrest frame optical morphologies generally have faint, large-scale emission\nsurrounding multiple components of ~10 kpc size. The brightest of the small\nknots are often aligned with the radio structures. At z < 3, the morphologies\nchange dramatically, showing single, compact structures without radio-aligned\nfeatures. The sizes and luminosities of the individual components in the z > 3\nradio galaxies are similar to those of the radio-quiet star-forming galaxies\ndiscovered at z ~ 3 by the Lyman dropout technique. The rest frame optical\ncolors of the z > 3 radio galaxies are consistent with models in which recent\nstar formation dominates the observed IR light, and in one case (4C 41.17) we\nhave direct spectroscopic evidence for massive star formation (Dey et al.\n1997a). Our results suggest that the z > 3 radio galaxies evolve into very\nmassive elliptical galaxies at 2 < z < 3, in qualitative agreement with the\nhierarchical model of galaxy formation. We also discuss the Hubble diagram of\nradio galaxies, the possibility of a radio power dependence in the K-z\nrelation, and the implications for radio galaxy formation.",

    "summary": "To understand the origin of the dynamical transition, between high\ntemperature exponential relaxation and low temperature nonexponential\nrelaxation, that occurs well above the static transition in glassy systems, a\nfrustrated spin model, with and without disorder, is considered. The model has\ntwo phase transitions, the lower being a standard spin glass transition (in\npresence of disorder) or fully frustrated Ising (in absence of disorder), and\nthe higher being a Potts transition. Monte Carlo results clarify that in the\nmodel with (or without) disorder the precursor phenomena are related to the\nGriffiths (or Potts) transition. The Griffiths transition is a vanishing\ntransition which occurs above the Potts transition and is present only when\ndisorder is present, while the Potts transition which signals the effect due to\nfrustration is always present. These results suggest that precursor phenomena\nin frustrated systems are due either to disorder and/or to frustration, giving\na consistent interpretation also for the limiting cases of Ising spin glass and\nof Ising fully frustrated model, where also the Potts transition is vanishing.\nThis interpretation could play a relevant role in glassy systems beyond the\nspin systems case.",

We construct this limit both for\nthe spectrum and the secular equations describing the excitations.

The structure of the massive sector is closely analogous to\nthat of the half filled band and consequently to the chiral invariant SU(2)\nGross-Neveu (CGN) model. The structure of the massless sector differs from that\nof the half filled band case: the excitations are of particle and hole type,\nhowever they are not uniquely defined. The energy and the momentum of this\nsector exhibits a tower structure corresponding to a conformal field theory\nwith c=1 and SU(2)xSU(2) symmetry.

In this model two types of pseudoscalar states (massless\npions and massive \\Pi-mesons), as well as one scalar one arise as a consequence\nof dynamical chiral symmetry breaking.

This echo attenuates as a function of the time $t_R$\nelapsed until the dynamics is reverted.

The second is\nthat it is a relatively young, highly magnetized neutron star, a ``magnetar'',\nwhich is kept hot by magnetic field decay.",

The observations were collected over a\nfour year period (1994-1997), permitting an investigation of the mid-infrared\nspectral shape as a function of the pulsation cycle (typically 1-2 years). The\nspectra of stars with little excess infrared emission and those with\ncarbon-rich dust show the least spectral variability, while stars with evidence\nfor dusty, oxygen-rich envelopes are most likely to show discernible variations\nin their spectral profile. Most significantly, a large fraction of variable\nstars with strong 9.7 micron emission features show clear spectral profile\nchanges which repeat from one cycle to the next. The significant sharpening of\nthe silicate feature near maximum light can not be fully explained by heating\nand cooling of the circumstellar dust shell during the pulsational cycle,\nsuggesting that the dust optical properties themselves must also be varying. In\naddition, the appearance of a narrow emission feature near the silicate peak\nfor a few stars may require the production of especially ``pure'' silicate dust\nnear maximum light. The general narrowing of the silicate feature observed may\nreflect the evolution of the pre-existing dirty grains whose surface impurities\nhave been evaporated off when the grain temperature rises preceding maximum\nlight. An improved theory of dust formation which can explain the observed\nchanges in the grain properties around a single, pulsating star may lead to a\ndefinitive explanation for the diversity of silicate emission profiles observed\namongst oxygen-rich, late-type stars.",

Using the high time resolution\navailable from this voltage recording technique, we have studied a variety of\nsingle-pulse properties, most for the first time in a millisecond pulsar. We\nfind no evidence for \"diffractive\" quantization effects in the individual pulse\narrival times or amplitudes as have been reported for this pulsar at lower\nradio frequency using coarser time resolution (Ables et al. 1997). Overall, we\nfind that the single pulse properties of PSR J0437-4715 are similar to those of\nthe common slow-rotating pulsars, even though this pulsar's magnetosphere and\nsurface magnetic field are several orders of magnitude smaller than those of\nthe general population.

    "summary": "The discovery of a population of young galaxies at an epoch when the universe\nwas about one tenth of its current age has shed new light on the question of\nwhen and how galaxies formed. Within the context of popular models this is the\npopulation of primeval galaxies that built themselves up to the size of\npresent--day galaxies through the process of repeated mergers. But the recent\ndetection of a large concentration of these primeval galaxies (Steidel et al.\n1997) appears to be incompatible with hierarchical clustering models, which\ngenerally predict that clusters of this size are fully formed later in time.\nHere we use a combination of two powerful theoretical techniques\n--semi-analytic modelling and N-body simulations-- to show that such large\nconcentrations should be quite common in a universe dominated by cold dark\nmatter, and that they are the progenitors of the rich galaxy clusters seen\ntoday. We predict the clustering properties of primeval galaxies which should,\nwhen compared with data that will be collected in the near future, test our\nunderstanding of galaxy formation within the framework of a universe dominated\nby cold dark matter.",

We find that the ellipticity\ndistribution of LSB dIs is very similar to that of BCDs, and marginally\ndifferent from that of dEs. We then determine the distribution of intrinsic\nshapes of dI galaxies and compare to those of other type dwarf galaxies under\nvarious assumptions. First, we assume that LSB dIs are either all oblate or all\nprolate, and use non-parametric analysis to find the best-fitting distribution\nof intrinsic shapes. With this assumption, we find that the scarcity of nearly\ncircular LSB dIs implies, at the 99% confidence level, that they cannot be a\npopulation of randomly oriented oblate or prolate objects. Next, we assume that\ndIs are triaxial, and use parametric analysis to find permissible distributions\nof intrinsic shapes. We find that if the intrinsic axis ratios, $\\beta$ and\n$\\gamma$, are distributed according to a Gaussian with means $\\beta_0$ and\n$\\gamma_0$ and a common standard deviation of $\\sigma$, the best-fitting set of\nparameters for LSB dIs is $(\\beta_0,\\gamma_0,\\sigma) = (0.66,0.50,0.15)$, and\nthe best fit for BCDs is $(\\beta_0,\\gamma_0,\\sigma) = (0.66,0.55,0.16)$, while\nthe best fit for dEs is $(\\beta_0,\\gamma_0,\\sigma) = (0.78,0.69,0.24)$. The dIs\nand BCDs thus have a very similar shape distribution, given this triaxial\nhypothesis, while the dEs peak at a somewhat more spherical shape. Our results\nare consistent with an evolutionary scenario in which the three types of dwarf\ngalaxy have a close relation with each other.",

This new, single-step, Hipparcos calibrated method seems to be one of\nthe most precise techniques of distance determination with very small\nstatistical error due to large number of red clump stars usually available. The\ndistances were determined independently along four lines-of-sight located at\nopposite sides of each Magellanic Cloud. The results for each line-of-sight are\nvery consistent. For the SMC we obtain the distance modulus:\nm-M=18.56+/-0.03+/-0.06 mag (statistical and systematic errors, respectively)\nand for the LMC: m-M=18.08+/-0.03+/-0.12} mag where systematic errors are\nmostly due to uncertainty in reddening estimates. Both distances will be\nrefined and systematic errors reduced when accurate reddening maps for our\nfields are available. Distance moduli to both Magellanic Clouds are ~0.4 mag\nsmaller than generally accepted values. The modulus to the LMC is in good\nagreement with the recent determinations from RR Lyrae type stars and upper\nlimit resulting from the SN1987A echo. We suspect that the distance to the LMC\nand SMC is shorter by about 15% than previously assumed: 42 kpc and 52 kpc,\nrespectively.\n  We also present our color-magnitude diagrams around the red clump for the LMC\nand SMC. We identify vertical red clump, first noted by Zaritsky and Lin\n(1997), in the color-magnitude diagram of both Magellanic Clouds and we\ninterpret it as an evolutionary feature rather than unknown stellar population\nbetween the LMC and our Galaxy.",

    "summary": "Local, or short-range, order in disordered alloys is an important and\nexciting phenomenon which is quantified in electron, X-ray and neutron\nscattering experiments. It is discussed in many excellent reviews and books, as\nwell as in the multitude of original research papers.\n  This relatively short review of the subject does not attempt to discuss all\naspects of the problem of local correlations in alloys. In particular, we will\nnot touch such issues as multiatom (cluster) interactions, static displacements\nand vibrations of alloy atoms, partially ordered, multicomponent or amorphous\nalloys. As a result, we will concentrate on the Hamiltonian traditional for the\nconsidered problem, that of the Ising model on a rigid ideal lattice with pair,\nbut otherwise arbitrary (i.e., of any range) interatomic interactions.\n  The central object of the paper is the pair correlation function of the\ncorresponding dynamical variables of the model, the occupation numbers or spin\nvariables, the Fourier transform of which is proportional to the intensity of\ndiffuse scattering caused by atomic short-range order. The main aim is to show\nthat the expression for this quantity has certain internal structure analogous,\ne.g., to that of the averaged Green's function used in the electronic theory of\ndisordered alloys. This structure is independent of the approximation used for\nthe quantitative description of correlations. As will be seen, this structure\nalone, without further specification of a particular theory of short-range\norder, allows us to see new possibilities in diffuse scattering, some of which\nhave recently been observed experimentally.",

    "summary": "We consider classical and quantum strings in the conformally invariant\nbackground corresponding to the SL(2,R) WZWN model. This background is locally\nanti-de Sitter spacetime with non-vanishing torsion. Conformal invariance is\nexpressed as the torsion being parallelized. The precise effect of the\nconformal invariance on the dynamics of both circular and generic classical\nstrings is extracted. In particular, the conformal invariance gives rise to a\nrepulsive interaction of the string with the background which precisely cancels\nthe dominant attractive term arising from gravity. We perform both\nsemi-classical and canonical string-quantization, in order to see the effect of\nthe conformal invariance of the background on the string mass spectrum. Both\napproaches yield that the high-mass states are governed by m sim HN (N,`large\ninteger'), where m is the string mass and H is the Hubble constant. It follows\nthat the level spacing grows proportionally to N: d(m^2 alpha')/dN sim N, while\nthe entropy goes like: S sim sqrt{m}. Moreover, it follows that there is no\nHagedorn temperature,so that the partition function is well defined at any\npositive temperature. All results are compared with the analogue results in\nAnti- de Sitter spacetime, which is a non conformal invariant background.\nConformal invariance simplifies the mathematics of the problem but the physics\nremains mainly unchanged. Differences between conformal and non-conformal\nbackgrounds only appear in the intermediate region of the string spectrum, but\nthese differences are minor. For low and high masses, the string mass spectra\nin conformal and non-conformal backgrounds are identical. Interestingly enough,\nconformal invariance fixes the value of the spacetime curvature to be -69/(26\nalpha').",

In particular, a\nprecision better than 1% in the measurement of any of the three one year\naveraged D-N asymmetries considered by us would be required to test the small\nmixing angle nonadiabatic $\\nu_e --> \\nu_s$ solution at $\\sin^2 2\\theta_V\n~\\ltap ~0.01$.",

    "summary": "A high-symmetry crystal surface may undergo a kinetic instability during the\ngrowth, such that its late stage evolution resembles a phase separation\nprocess. This parallel is rigorous in one dimension, if the conserved surface\ncurrent is derivable from a free energy. We study the problem in presence of a\nphysically relevant term breaking the up-down symmetry of the surface and which\ncan not be derived from a free energy. Following the treatment introduced by\nKawasaki and Ohta [Physica 116A, 573 (1982)] for the symmetric case, we are\nable to translate the problem of the surface evolution into a problem of\nnonlinear dynamics of kinks (domain walls). Because of the break of symmetry,\ntwo different classes ($A$ and $B$) of kinks appear and their analytical form\nis derived. The effect of the adding term is to shrink a kink $A$ and to widen\nthe neighbouring kink $B$, in such a way that the product of their widths keeps\nconstant. Concerning the dynamics, this implies that kinks $A$ move much faster\nthan kinks $B$. Since the kink profiles approach exponentially the asymptotical\nvalues, the time dependence of the average distance $L(t)$ between kinks does\nnot change: $L(t)\\sim\\ln t$ in absence of noise, and $L(t)\\sim t^{1/3}$ in\npresence of (shot) noise. However, the cross-over time between the first and\nthe second regime may increase even of some orders of magnitude. Finally, our\nresults show that kinks $A$ may be so narrow that their width is comparable to\nthe lattice constant: in this case, they indeed represent a discontinuity of\nthe surface slope, that is an angular point, and a different approach to\ncoarsening should be used.",

The model is consistent with the assumption that, as the universe\nexpands and the comoving sizes of regions change as a result of gravitational\ninstability, the number of such expanding and contracting regions is conserved.\nThe model neglects the influence of external tides on the evolution of such\nregions. Indeed, in the context of this model, the GPD can be thought of as\narising from a simple variant of the well-studied spherical collapse model, in\nwhich tidal effects are also neglected. The model can be understood as a simple\ngeneralization of the excursion set model which is used to estimate the number\ndensity of collapsed, virialized halos. The generalization allows one to\ndescribe the spatial distribution of the halos and the mass simultaneously, so\nthe extent to which these halos are biased tracers of the underlying matter\ndistribution is easy to estimate.",

Due to the broad redshift\ndistribution of galaxies at faint magnitude limits the correlation signal has\nbeen extremely difficult to detect and interpret. We introduce a new technique\nfor measuring the evolution of clustering. We utilize photometric redshifts,\nderived from multicolor surveys, to isolate redshift intervals and calculate\nthe evolution of the amplitude of the angular 2-pt correlation function.\nApplying these techniques to the the Hubble Deep Field we find that the shape\nof the correlation function, at z=1, is consistent with a power law with a\nslope of -0.8. For z>0.4 the best fit to the data is given by a model of\nclustering evolution with a comoving r0 = 2.37 Mpc and eps = -0.4 +/- 0.5,\nconsistent with published measures of the clustering evolution. To match the\ncanonical value of r0 = 5.4 Mpc, found for the clustering of local galaxies,\nrequires a value of eps = 2.10 +/- 0.5 (significantly more than linear\nevolution). The log likelihood of this latter fit is 4.15 less than that for\nthe r0 = 2.37 Mpc model. We, therefore, conclude that the parameterization of\nthe clustering evolution of (1+z)^-(3+eps) is not a particularly good fit to\nthe data.",

Variability is observed both between the two epochs and within\nthe individual observations, the latter due to a non-stationary process.\n  We find the spectra at both epochs to contain features due to absorption by\nionized material, predominantly due to Ovii and Oviii. We find the opacity for\nsuch material to decrease by a factor approx 2 in the approx 0.7--1.0 keV band\nbetween the epochs while the photoionizing flux increases by approx25%. By\ncomparison with detailed photoionization models we show this behaviour is\ninconsistent with that expected from a single-zone of photoionized gas. A\ndeficit in the data compared to such models, consistent with excess absorption\nby Oviii, supports the suggestion that the material consists of two or more\nzones.\n  Significant Fe K-shell emission is also observed during both epochs. We show\nthis emission is dominated by the asymmetric line profile expected from the\ninnermost regions of the accretion flow. We find no evidence that the Fe\nemission varied in either shape or equivalent width between the two epochs.",

On the other hand was\nthe study of the formation and evolution of structures, from globular-cluster\nsized objects to large-scale structures. These lines of investigation are now\nbecoming increasingly intertwined, and this tendency manifested itself in this\nconference. Following is my personal perspective on where we stand today. I\nalso discuss some technological developments that I think will affect the\nfield. My concluding remarks are very informal.

A numerical simulation of\na set of shells formed in the merger between an elliptical and a smaller galaxy\nreveals that the shells have a characteristic observable kinematic structure,\nwith the maximum line-of-sight velocity increasing linearly as one moves inward\nfrom a shell edge. A simple analytic calculation shows that this structure\nprovides a direct measure of the gradient of the gravitational potential at the\nshell radius. In order to extract this information from attainable data, we\nhave also derived the complete distribution of line-of-sight velocities for\nmaterial within a shell; comparing the observed spectra of a shell to a stellar\ntemplate convolved with this distribution will enable us to measure the\ngradient of the potential at this radius. Repeating the analysis for a whole\nseries of nested shells in a galaxy allows the complete form of the\ngravitational potential as a function of radius to be mapped out.

We show that in N=1 supersymmetric\nYang Mills theory, ``naive dimensional analysis'' seems to work well, with\n$\\Lambda_\\chi$ consistently equal to the scale at which the perturbatively\nevolved physical coupling becomes of order $4 \\pi$. We turn to N=2 theories to\nunderstand better the effect of instantons in accounting for the QCD\ndiscrepancy between scales. In N=2 supersymmetric SU(2) the instanton\ncorrections are known to all orders from the Seiberg-Witten solution and give\nrise to a finite scale ratio between the scale at which the perturbatively\nevolved and ``nonperturbatively evolved'' couplings blow up. Correspondingly,\ninstanton effects are important even when the associated perturbatively evolved\ngauge coupling only gives $\\alpha$ of order 1 (rather than $4 \\pi$).

The J =2-1\nline of SiO is seen only in few regions of the Galactic disk. This line is\neasily detected in all Galactic center sources observed. A comparison of the\nstrength of the rare isotopomers 29SiO and 30SiO to the strength of the main\nisotopomer 28SiO implies that the J = 2-1 transition of 28SiO is optically\nthick. The 29Si/30Si isotope ratio of 1.6 in the Galactic center clouds is\nconsistent with the terrestrial value. Large Velocity Gradient models show that\nthe dense component (n_(H_2) > 10^4cm-3) in typical molecular cores in the\nGalactic center is cool (TKIN ~ 25K), contrary to what is usually found in\nGiant Molecular Clouds in the disk, where the densest cores are the hottest.\nHigh kinetic temperatures, > 100K, known to exist from NH_3 studies, are only\npresent at lower gas densities of a few 10^3cm-3, where SiO is highly\nsubthermal. Assuming that C18O traces all of the molecular gas, it is found\nthat in all cases but one, SiO emission is compatible with arising in gas at\nhigher density that is (presently) relatively cool. The relative abundance of\nSiO is typically 10^-9, but differs significantly between individual sources.\nIt shows a dependence on the position of the source within the Galactic center\nregion. High abundances are found in those regions for which bar potential\nmodels predict a high likelihood for cloud-cloud collisions. These results can\nbe used to relate the amount of gas that has encountered shocks within the last\n~ 10^6 years to the large scale kinematics in the inner ~500pc of the Galaxy.",

On closer\ninspection, however, a tension is revealed between the inferred primordial\nabundances of deuterium and helium-4. Although observations of deuterium in\nnearly primordial, high-redshift QSO absorbers may help to relieve this\ntension, current data appear to exacerbate the crisis.

The empirical power-law distribution of SGR burst energies,\nanalogous to the Gutenberg-Richter law for earthquakes, exhibits a turn-over at\nhigh energies consistent with a global limit on the crust fracture size. With\nsuch large starquakes occurring, the significant excitation of global seismic\noscillations (GSOs) seems likely. Moreover, GSOs may be self-exciting in a\nstellar crust that is strained by many, randomly-oriented stresses. We explain\nwhy low-order toroidal modes, which preserve the shape of the star and have\nobservable frequencies as low as ~ 30 Hz, may be especially susceptible to\nexcitation. We estimate the eigenfrequencies as a function of stellar mass and\nradius, and their magnetic and rotational shiftings/splittings. We also\ndescribes ways in which these modes might be detected and damped. There is\nmarginal evidence for 23 ms oscillations in the hard initial pulse of the 1979\nMarch 5th event.

In two 16' x 16' fields, we identify 69 and 16\nintracluster planetary nebula candidates, respectively. In a third 16' x 16'\nfield near the central elliptical galaxy M87, we detect 75 planetary nebula\ncandidates, of which a substantial fraction are intracluster in nature. By\nexamining the number of the planetaries detected in each field and the shape of\nthe planetary nebula luminosity function, we show that 1) the intracluster\nstarlight of Virgo is distributed non-uniformly, and varies between subclumps A\nand B, 2) the Virgo Cluster core extends ~3 Mpc in front of M87, and thus is\nelongated along the line-of-sight, and 3) a minimum of 22% of Virgo's stellar\nluminosity resides between the galaxies in our fields, and that the true number\nmay be considerably larger. We also use our planetary nebula data to argue that\nthe intracluster stars in Virgo are likely derived from a population that is of\nmoderate age and metallicity.",

A Hilbert space of dimension 5 x 10^+18 is explored. The\nground state energy is 10^-3 eV within the full CI value in the case N=18. The\nDMRG method compares favourably also with coupled cluster approximations. The\nunrestricted Hartree-Fock solution (which presents spin density waves) is\nbriefly reviewed, and a comparison is made with the DMRG energy values.\nFinally, the spin-spin and density-density correlation functions are computed;\nthe results suggest that the antiferromagnetic order of the exact solution does\nnot extend up to large distances but exists locally.

    "summary": "Wind-blown bubbles, from those around massive O and Wolf-Rayet stars, to\nsuperbubbles around OB associations and galactic winds in starburst galaxies,\nhave a dominant role in determining the structure of the Interstellar Medium.\nX-ray observations of these bubbles are particularly important as most of their\nvolume is taken up with hot gas, 1E5 < T (K) < 1E8. However, it is difficult to\ncompare X-ray observations, usually analysed in terms of single or two\ntemperature spectral model fits, with theoretical models, as real bubbles do\nnot have such simple temperature distributions. In this introduction to a\nseries of papers detailing the observable X-ray properties of wind-blown\nbubbles, we describe our method with which we aim to solve this problem,\nanalysing a simulation of a wind-blown bubble around a massive star. We model a\nwind of constant mass and energy injection rate, blowing into a uniform ISM,\nfrom which we calculate X-ray spectra as would be seen by the ROSAT PSPC. We\ncompare the properties of the bubble as would be inferred from the ROSAT data\nwith the true properties of the bubble in the simulation. We find standard\nspectral models yield inferred properties that deviate significantly from the\ntrue properties, even though the spectral fits are statistically acceptable,\nand give no indication that they do not represent to true spectral\ndistribution. Our results suggest that in any case where the true source\nspectrum does not come from a simple single or two temperature distribution the\n\"observed\" X-ray properties cannot naively be used to infer the true\nproperties.",

The latter form of magnetic torque decreases in strength more slowly\nwith increasing radius, and will therefore dominate at large radii. The\ndirection of the disc field is not determined by the difference in angular\nvelocity between the star and the disc as in the Ghosh & Lamb model, but is\nrather a free parameter. The magnetic torque may therefore either spin up or\nspin down the star, and the torque changes sign if the magnetic field in the\ndisc reverses.

In the past a wide range of possible depletion factors, ranging from\nminimal in standard (non-rotating) stellar models to as much as an order of\nmagnitude in models including rotational mixing have been suggested. Using\nrecent progress in the study of the angular momentum evolution of low mass\nstars, which now permits the construction of theoretical models that reproduce\nthe angular momentum evolution of low mass open cluster stars, along with the\nobserved distribution of initial angular momenta inferred from stellar rotation\ndata in young open clusters, we study lithium depletion in main sequence halo\nstars. We predict a well-defined, nearly flat (in T_eff) halo lithium plateau\nwith modest scatter and a small population of outliers. We also examine the\nrelative depletions of 6Li and 7Li finding that the dispersion in the plateau\nand the 6Li/7Li depletion ratio scale with the absolute 7Li depletion. Using\nobservational data to bound the 7Li depletion in main sequence halo stars, we\nfind a maximum depletion of 0.4 dex is set by the observed dispersion and the\n6Li/7Li depletion ratio, and a minimum depletion of 0.2 dex is required by both\nthe presence of highly overdepleted halo stars and consistency with the solar\nand open cluster 7Li data. The cosmological implications of these bounds on the\nprimordial abundance of 7Li are discussed. (Abridged)",

We first calculate\nthe dynamic structure function of a He-3 impurity atom moving in He-3. From\nthat we obtain the excitation spectrum and the momentum dependent effective\nmass. The pole strength of this excitation mode is strongly reduced from the\nfree particle value in agreement with experiments; part of the strength is\ndistributed over high frequency excitations. Above k > 1.7$\\AA$^{-1}$ the\nmotion of the impurity is damped due to the decay into a roton and a low energy\nimpurity mode. Next we determine the Fermi--Liquid interaction between He-4\natoms and calculate the pressure-- and concentration dependence of the\neffective mass, magnetic susceptibility, and the He-3--He-3 scattering phase\nshifts. The calculations are based on a dynamic theory that uses, as input,\neffective interactions provided by the Fermi hypernetted--chain theory. The\nrelationship between both theories is discussed. Our theoretical effective\nmasses agree well with recent measurements by Yorozu et al. (Phys. Rev. B 48,\n9660 (1993)) as well as those by R. Simons and R. M. Mueller (Czekoslowak\nJournal of Physics Suppl. 46, 201 (1996)), but our analysis suggests a new\nextrapolation to the zero-concentration limit. With that effective mass we also\nfind a good agreement with the measured Landau parameter F_0^a.",

The\ncalculation of this probability is afflicted by the usual problem of a\nposteriori statistics. We introduce a clustering statistic, which is formed\nfrom the \"minimum circle radius\" (i.e. the radius of the smallest circle that\njust encloses the positions of all the events) and the minimum time lapse (i.e.\nthe time elapsed between the first and last event). We also introduce a second\nclustering statistic, which is formed from the \"cluster likelihood function\"\nand the minimum time lapse. We show that the use of these statistics largely\neliminates the \"a posteriori\" nature of the problem. The two statistics yield\nsignificances of the clustering of $3.3\\times 10^{-4}$ and $3.1\\times 10^{-5}$,\nrespectively, if we interpret the four events as four bursts, whereas the\nclustering is not significant if we interpret the four events as only three\nbursts.

From an analysis of the observed spectra of three stars in the GRB\n970228 field, we find $A_V = 1.71^{+0.20}_{-0.40}$. This value may represent\nthe best estimate of the extinction in the direction of GRB 970228, since these\nthree stars lie only $2.7''$, $16''$, and $42''$ away from the optical\ntransient. If instead we combine the two results, we obtain a conservative\nvalue $A_V = 1.3 \\pm 0.2$. This value is significantly larger than the values\n$A_V = 0.4 - 0.8$ used in papers to date. The value of $A_V$ that we find\nimplies that, if the extended source in the burst error circle is extragalactic\nand therefore lies beyond the dust in our own galaxy, its optical spectrum is\nvery blue: its observed color $(V-I_c)_{obs} \\approx 0.65^{+0.74}_{-0.94}$ is\nconsistent only with a starburst galaxy, an irregular galaxy at $z > 1.5$, or a\nspiral galaxy at $z > 2$.

A\nclassical top rotates about its own axis which precesses around a vertical\nfixed external axis. The hovering magnetic top, on the other hand, has its axis\nslightly tilted and moves rigidly as a whole about the vertical axis. We call\nthis motion synchronous, because in a stroboscopic experiment we see that a\npoint at the rim of the top moves synchronously with the top axis. We show that\nthe synchronous motion may be attributed to a small deviation of the magnetic\nmoment from the symmetry axis of the top. We calculate the minimum angular\nvelocity required for stability in terms of the moments of inertia and magnetic\nfield and show that it is different from that of a classical top. We also give\nexperimental results that were taken with a top whose moment of inertia can be\nchanged. These results show very good agreement with our calculations.",

Their basic\ndynamics consists in the auto-catalysis of the individual capital and in the\nglobal competition/cooperation between the agents mediated by the total wealth\ninvested in the stock (which we identify with the stock-index). We show that\nsuch systems lead generically to (truncated) Pareto power-law distribution of\nthe individual wealth. This, in turn, leads to intermittent market (short time)\nreturns parametrized by a (truncated) Levy distribution. We relate the\ntruncation in the Levy distribution to the (truncation in the Pareto Power Law\ni.e. to the) fact that at each moment no trader can own more than the current\ntotal wealth invested in the stock. In the cases where the system is dominated\nby the largest traders, the dynamics looks similar to noisy low-dimensional\nchaos. By introducing traders memory and/or feedback between individual and\ncollective wealth fluctuations (the later identified with the stock returns),\none obtains clustered \"volatility\" as well as market booms and crashes. The\nbasic feedback loop consists in: - computing the market price of the stock as\nthe sum of the individual wealths invested in the stock by the traders and -\ndetermining the time variation of the individual trader wealth as his/her\nprevious wealth multiplied by the stock return (i.e. the variation of the stock\nprice).",

We concentrate this study on the chemistry of H2O and O2, two molecules\nwhich are predicted to have abundances that are significantly affected in\nshock-heated gas. Two models are presented: (1) a three-stage model of\npre-shock, shocked, and post-shock gas; and (2) a Monte-Carlo cloud simulation\nwhere we explore the effects of stochastic shock activity on molecular gas over\na cloud lifetime. In agreement with previous studies, we find that shock\nvelocities in excess of 10 km s^-1 are required to convert all of the oxygen\nnot locked in CO into H2O before the gas has an opportunity to cool. For pure\ngas-phase models the lifetime of the high water abundances, or ``H2O legacy'',\nin the post-shock gas is 4 - 7 x 10^5 years. Through the Monte Carlo cloud\nsimulation we demonstrate that the time-average abundance of H2O is a sensitive\nfunction of the frequency of shocks. Thus we predict that the abundance of H2O\nand other known outflow tracers can be used to trace the history of shock\nactivity in molecular gas. For gas-grain models we find that the abundance of\nwater-ice on grain surfaces can be quite large and is comparable to that\nobserved in molecular clouds. This offers a possible alternative method to\ncreate water mantles without resorting to grain surface chemistry: gas heating\nand chemical modification due to a C-type shock and subsequent depletion of the\ngas-phase species onto grain mantles.",

An especially interesting environment for such a process are the\ncoronae of accretion disks in active galactic nuclei (AGN). There, Keplerian\nshear flows perturb the quite strong disk magnetic field leading to intense\ncurrent sheets. It was previously shown that given field strengths of 200 G in\na shear flow, reconnection driven magnetic field aligned electric fields can\naccelerate electrons up to Lorentz factors of about 2000 in those objects thus\nproviding us with a possible solution of the injection (pre-acceleration)\nproblem. However, whereas in the framework of magnetohydrodynamics the\nformation of the field-aligned electric fields can be described consistently,\nthe question has to be addressed whether the charged particles can really be\naccelerated up to the maximum energy supplied by the field-aligned electric\npotentials, since the accelerated particles undergo energy losses either by\nsynchrotron or inverse Compton mechanisms. We present relativistic particle\nsimulations starting from electric and magnetic fields obtained from\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulations of magnetic reconnection in an idealized AGN\nconfiguration including nonthermal radiative losses. The numerical results\nprove that the relativistic electrons can be effectively accelerated even in\nthe presence of an intense radiation bath. Energies from 50 MeV up to 40 GeV\ncan be reached easily, depending on the energy density of the photon bath.",

The\ninteraction couples one quark color-charge density to another, much as electric\ncharge densities are coupled to each other by the Coulomb interaction in QED.\nIn QCD, this nonlocal interaction also couples quark color-charge densities to\ngluonic color. We show how the leading part of the interaction between quark\ncolor-charge densities vanishes when the participating quarks are in a color\nsinglet configuration, and that, for singlet configurations, the residual\ninteraction weakens as the size of a packet of quarks shrinks. Because of this\neffect, color-singlet packets of quarks should experience final state\ninteractions that increase in strength as these packets expand in size. For the\ncase of an SU(2) model of QCD based on the {\\em ansatz} that the\ngauge-invariant gauge field is a hedgehog configuration, we show how the\ninfinite series that represents the nonlocal interaction between quark\ncolor-charge densities can be evaluated nonperturbatively, without expanding it\nterm-by-term.

    "summary": "We derive a self similar solution for the propagation of an extreme\nrelativistic (or Newtonian) radiative spherical blast wave into a surrounding\ncold medium. The solution is obtained under the assumption that the radiation\nprocess is fast, it takes place only in the vicinity of the shock and that it\nradiates away a fixed fraction of the energy generated by the shock. In the\nNewtonian regime these solutions generalize the Sedov-Taylor adiabatic solution\nand the pressure-driven fully radiative solution. In the extreme relativistic\ncase these solutions generalize the Blandford-McKee adiabatic solution. They\nprovide a new fully radiative extreme relativistic solution which is different\nfrom the Blandford-McKee fully radiative relativistic solution. This new\nsolution develops a hot interior which causes it to cool faster than previous\nestimates. We find that the energy of the blast wave behaves as a power law of\nthe location of the shock. The power law index depends on the fraction of the\nenergy emitted by the shock. We obtain an analytic solution for the interior of\nthe blast wave. These new solutions might be applicable to the study of GRB\nafterglow or SNRs.",

The framework consists of a\ntemporal intermediate representation language, called TOP, an HPSG grammar that\nmaps a wide range of questions involving temporal mechanisms to appropriate TOP\nexpressions, and a provably correct method for translating from TOP to TSQL2,\nTSQL2 being a recently proposed temporal extension of the SQL database\nlanguage.

The 325-1200 Hz quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in\nthe accretion-powered emission are thought to be produced by gas orbiting very\nclose to the neutron star, whereas the 360-600 Hz brightness oscillations seen\nduring thermonuclear X-ray bursts are produced by one or two hot spots rotating\nwith the star and have frequencies equal to the stellar spin frequency or its\nfirst overtone. The oscillations constrain the masses and radii of these\nneutron stars, which are thought to be the progenitors of the millisecond\npulsars. Modeling indicates that the stars have spin frequencies 250-350 Hz and\nmagnetic fields 1e7-5e9 G.",

The interaction of this wind with a cluster of dense\ncondensations traps the magnetic field lines for a long time and stretches\nthem, leading to a strong magnetic field.\n  If relativistic particles are formed as the fast wind is shocked, then the\nenhanced magnetic field will result in nonthermal radio emission.\n  The typical nonthermal radio flux at 1 GHz can be up to several milli-Jansky.\n  In order to detect the nonthermal emission, the emitting region should be\nspatially resolved from the main optical nebula.\n  We list other planetary nebulae which may possess nonthermal radio emission.",

The QPO had an rms\namplitude of 1.7+/-0.2 % (2-13.0 keV) and a FWHM of 15.9+/-4.2 Hz. Its\nfrequency increased with count rate and its amplitude increased with photon\nenergy.

It was only found\nwhen the QPO was detected. Very low frequency noise was present with a power\nlaw index of ~1, and an rms amplitude of ~4 %. A second observation showed\nsimilar variability components. In the X-ray color-color diagram the source did\nnot trace out the usual banana branch, but showed a two branched structure.\n  This is the first detection of a QPO in one of the four persistently bright\natoll sources in the galactic bulge.

Examples include\nthe free relativistic massless particle and the hydrogen atom in any number of\ndimensions. The key is the gauging of the Sp(2) duality symmetry that treats\nposition and momentum (x,p) as a doublet in phase space. As a consequence of\nthe gauging, the Minkowski space-time vectors (x^\\mu, p^\\mu) get enlarged by\none additional space-like and one additional time-like dimensions to (x^M,p^M).\nA manifest global symmetry SO(d,2) rotates (x^M,p^M) like d+2 dimensional\nvectors. The SO(d,2) symmetry of the parent theory may be interpreted as the\nfamiliar conformal symmetry of quantum field theory in Minkowski spacetime in\none gauge, or as the dynamical symmetry of a totally different physical system\nin another gauge. Thanks to the gauge symmetry, the theory permits various\nchoices of ``time'' which correspond to different looking Hamiltonians, while\navoiding ghosts. Thus we demonstrate that there is a physical role for a\nspacetime with two times when taken together with a gauged duality symmetry\nthat produces appropriate constraints.",

This is done\nboth by using the heavy quark expansion technique (HQET) and a perturbative-QCD\nimproved Fermi motion (FM) model which takes into account $B$-meson\nwave-function effects. The corrections in the hadron energy ($E_H$) spectrum\nare found to be small over a good part of this spectrum in both the methods.\nHowever, the expansion in $1/m_b$ in HQET fails near the lower kinematic\nend-point and at the $c\\bar{c}$ threshold. The hadronic invariant mass ($S_H$)\nspectrum is calculable only over a limited range $S_H > \\bar{\\Lambda}m_B$ in\nthe heavy quark expansion, where $\\bar{\\Lambda} \\simeq m_B-m_b$. We also\npresent results for the first two hadronic moments $< S_H^n>$ and $< E_H^n>$,\n$n=1,2$, working out their sensitivity on the HQET and FM model parameters. For\nequivalent values of these parameters, the moments in these methods are\nremarkably close to each other. Using the FM model, we study the effect of the\nexperimental cuts, used recently by the CLEO collaboration in searching for the\ndecay $B \\to X_s \\ell^+ \\ell^-$, on the hadron spectra and hadronic invariant\nmass moments. The constraints following from assumed values of $< S_H^n>$ on\nthe HQET parameters $\\lambda_1$ and $\\bar{\\Lambda}$ are worked out.

Other viable sources\nwhich are similar to topological defects are relic superheavy particles. All\nthese sources have an excess of pions (and thus photons) over nucleons at\nproduction.

Another signature of the latter\nsources is anisotropy imposed by asymmetric position of the sun in the Galactic\nhalo.

    "summary": "Stochastic resonance holds much promise for the detection of weak signals in\nthe presence of relatively loud noise. Following the discovery of nondynamical\nand of aperiodic stochastic resonance, it was recently shown that the\nphenomenon can manifest itself even in the presence of nonstationary signals.\nThis was found in a composite system of differentiated trigger mechanisms\nmounted in parallel, which suggests that it could be realized in some\nelementary neural networks or nonlinear electronic circuits. Here, we find that\neven an individual trigger system may be able to detect weak nonstationary\nsignals using stochastic resonance. The very simple modification to the trigger\nmechanism that makes this possible is reminiscent of some aspects of actual\nneuron physics. Stochastic resonance may thus become relevant to more types of\nbiological or electronic systems injected with an ever broader class of\nrealistic signals.",

Our methods can be\nused: internally (between different subsets of a dataset) or externally\n(between different experiments); for observing regions that completely overlap,\npartially overlap or overlap not at all; and for observing strategies that\ndiffer greatly.\n  We apply the methods to check the consistency (internal and external) of the\nMSAM92, MSAM94 and Saskatoon Ring datasets.

In an image containing only off-pulse emission, we\nfind a weak, slightly extended source coincident with the pulsar's position,\nwhich we argue is best interpreted as a pulsar wind nebula (PWN). A trail of\nemission extending behind the pulsar aligns with the major axis of the PWN, and\nimplies that the pulsar is moving north-west with projected velocity ~60 km/s,\nconsistent with its scintillation speed. The consequent density we infer for\nthe pulsar's environment is >2 cm^(-3), so that the PWN around PSR B0906-49 is\nconfined mainly by the high density of its surroundings rather than by the\npulsar's velocity. Other properties of the system such as the PWN's low\nluminosity and apparent steep spectrum, and the pulsar's large characteristic\nage, lead us to suggest that this nebula is substantially different from other\nradio PWNe, and may represent a transition between young pulsars with prominent\nradio PWNe and older pulsars for which no radio PWN has been detected. We\nrecommend that further searches for radio PWNe should be made as here: at low\nfrequencies and with the pulsed emission subtracted.",

We present a proposal for a\nnon-critical (Liouville) string approach to confinement of four-dimensional\n(non-abelian) gauge theories, based on recent developments on the subject by\nWitten and Maldacena. We discuss the effects of vortices and monopoles on the\nopen world-sheets whose boundaries are Wilson loops of the target-space (non\nAbelian) Gauge theory. By appropriately employing `D-particles', associated\nwith the target-space embedding of such defects, we argue that the apprearance\nof five-dimensional Anti-De-Sitter (AdS) space times is quite natural, as a\nresult of Liouville dressing.We isolate the world-sheet defect contributions to\nthe Wilson loop by constructing an appropriate observable, which is the same as\nthe second observable in the supersymmetric U(1) theory of Awada and Mansouri,\nbut in our approach supersymmetry is not necessary.When vortex condensation\noccurs, we argue in favour of a (low-temperature) confining phase, in the sense\nof an area law, for a large-$N_c$ (conformal) gauge theory at finite\ntemperatures. A connection of the Berezinski-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT)\ntransitions on the world-sheet with the critical temperatures in the\nthermodynamics of Black Holes in the five-dimensional AdS space is made.",

The peak\nRSG brightness is constant to within ~0.5 mag in K, suggesting that NGC55,\nNGC300, and NGC7793 are at comparable distances. Comparisons with bright RSGs\nin the Magellanic Clouds indicate that the difference in distance modulus with\nrespect to the LMC is = 7.5. A rich population of asymptotic giant branch (AGB)\nstars, which isochrones indicate have ages between 0.1 and 10 Gyr, dominates\nthe (K, J-K) color-magnitude diagram (CMD) of each galaxy. The detection of\nsignificant numbers of AGB stars with ages near 10 Gyr indicates that the disks\nof these galaxies contain an underlying old population. The CMDs and luminosity\nfunctions reveal significant galaxy-to-galaxy variations in stellar content.\nStar-forming activity in the central arcmin of NGC300 has been suppressed for\nthe past Gyr with respect to disk fields at larger radii. Nevertheless,\ncomparisons between fields within each galaxy indicate that star-forming\nactivity during intermediate epochs was coherent on spatial scales of a kpc or\nmore. A large cluster of stars, which isochrones suggest has an age near 100\nMyr, is seen in one of the NGC55 fields. The luminosity function of the\nbrightest stars in this cluster is flat, as expected if a linear\nluminosity-core mass relation is present.",

As a model for the inhomogeneity of the\ncosmological magnetic field, we adopt a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation,\nwhere the field is passively included, and can approximately represent the real\nfield distribution with an arbitrary normalization for the field strength.\nThen, we derive an upper limit of the magnetic field strength by comparing the\nobserved limit of rotational measure with the rotational measure expected from\nthe magnetic field geometry in the simulated model universe. The resulting\nupper limit to the magnetic field in filaments and sheets is ${\\bar B}_{fs} \\la\n1 \\mu G$ which is $\\sim10^3$ times higher than the previously quoted values.\nThis value is close to, but larger than, the equipartition magnetic field\nstrength in filaments and sheets.

This effect is\nparticularly important for measurements of weak gravitational lensing, for\nwhich the sought image distortions are typically of the order of only 1%. We\ncompute the effect of correlated noise on two-dimensional gaussian fits in full\ngenerality. The noise properties are naturally quantified by the noise\nautocorrelation function (ACF), which is easily measured in practice. We\ncompute the resulting bias on the mean, variance and covariance of the source\nparameters, and the induced correlation between the shapes of neighboring\nsources. We show that these biases are of second order in the inverse\nsignal-to-noise ratio of the source, and could thus be overlooked if bright\nstars are used to monitor systematic distortions. Radio interferometric surveys\nare particularly prone to this effect because of the long-range pixel\ncorrelations produced by the Fourier inversion involved in their image\nconstruction. As a concrete application, we consider the search for weak\nlensing by large-scale structure with the FIRST radio survey. We measure the\nnoise ACF for a FIRST coadded field, and compute the resulting ellipticity\ncorrelation function induced by the noise. In comparison with the weak-lensing\nsignal expected in CDM models, the noise correlation effect is important on\nsmall angular scales, but is negligible for source separations greater than\nabout 1 arcmin.

The simultaneous eigenfunction is a deformation of the\nsymmetrized number state (bosonic state) and forms an orthogonal basis of the\nHilbert (Fock) space of the model. This orthogonal basis is different from the\nknown one that is a variant of the Jack polynomial, i.e., the Hi-Jack\npolynomial. This fact shows that the conserved operators derived by the\nsimilarity transformation and those derived by the Dunkl operator formulation\ndo not commute. Thus we conclude that the Calogero model has two, algebraically\ninequivalent sets of mutually commuting conserved operators, as is the case\nwith the hydrogen atom. We also confirm the same story for the $B_{N}$-Calogero\nmodel.",

    "summary": "We develop a model for the growth of dark matter halos and use it to study\ntheir evolved density profiles. In this model, halos are spherical and form by\nquiescent accretion of matter in clumps, called satellites. The halo mass as a\nfunction of redshift is given by the mass of the most massive progenitor, and\nis determined from Monte-Carlo realizations of the merger-history tree. Inside\nthe halo, satellites move under the action of the gravitational force of the\nhalo and a dynamical friction drag force. The associated equation of motion is\nsolved numerically. The energy lost to dynamical friction is transferred to the\nhalo in the form of kinetic energy. As they sink into the halo, satellites\ncontinually lose matter as a result of tidal stripping. The stripped matter\nmoves inside the halo free of dynamical friction. The evolved density profiles\nare steeper than those obtained by assuming that, once they have been accreted\nonto the parent halo, satellites remain at a fixed distance from the halo\ncenter. We find that the final density profile depends mainly on the rate of\ninfall of matter onto the halo. This, in turn, depends on the initial\nfluctuation field as well as on cosmology. For mass scales where the effective\nspectral index of the initial density field is less than -1, the model predicts\na profile which can only approximately be matched by the one parameter family\nof curves suggested by Navarro, Frenk and White (1997). For scale-free\npower-spectra with initial slope $n$, the density profile within about 1% of\nthe virial radius is $\\rho\\propto r^{-\\beta}$, with $3(3+n)/(5+n)\\le\\beta\\le\n3(3+n)/(4+n)$.",

Naively, one\nmight expect that the probability of detecting the influence of more than one\nplanet on any single microlensing light curve would be small. Recently,\nhowever, Griest & Safizadeh (1998) have shown that, for a subset of events,\nthose with minimum impact parameter $u_{min} \\lsim 0.1$ (high magnification\nevents), the detection probability is nearly 100% for Jovian mass planets with\nprojected separations in the range 0.6--1.6 of the primary Einstein ring radius\n$R_E$, and remains substantial outside this zone. In this Letter, we point out\nthat this result implies that, regardless of orientation, all Jovian mass\nplanets with separations near 0.6--1.6$R_E$ dramatically affect the central\nregion of the magnification pattern, and thus have a significant probability of\nbeing detected (or ruled out) in high magnification events. The probability,\naveraged over all orbital phases and inclination angles, of two planets having\nprojected separations within 0.6--$1.6R_E$ is substantial: 1-15% for two\nplanets with the intrinsic orbital separations of Jupiter and Saturn orbiting\naround 0.3--1.0$M_\\odot$ parent stars. We illustrate by example the complicated\nmagnification patterns and light curves that can result when two planets are\npresent, and discuss possible implications of our result on detection\nefficiencies and the ability to discriminate between multiple and single\nplanets in high magnification events.",

Hard diffraction is\ndescribed using leading-order QCD matrix elements together with a parton\ndistribution function for the pomeron and pomeron-flux factorization. Since\nthis factorization is imposed on Born graph level only, unitarity corrections\nlead to a non-factorizing flux function. Rapidity gaps between jets are\nobtained by soft color reconnection.

The knowledge of the radial gas flows in\nthe galaxy allows us to trace metallicity gradients, and, in particular, the\nformation of a high-metallicity core in ellipticals. The high-metallicity core\nis formed soon enough to explain the metal abundances inferred in high-redshift\nquasars. The star formation rate and the subsequent feedback regulate the\nepisodes of wind, outflow, and cooling flow, thus affecting the recycling of\nthe gas and the chemical enrichment of the intergalactic medium. The evolution\nof the galaxy shows several stages, some of which are characterized by a\ncomplex flow pattern, with inflow in some regions and outflow in other regions.\nAll models, however, exhibit during their late evolution a galactic wind at the\nouter boundary and, during their early evolution, an inflow towards the galaxy\nnucleus. The inner inflow evolution could explain the bolometric luminosity of\na quasar lodged at the galaxy centre as well as the evolution of the QSO\nluminosity function.",

The total mass was estimated by\napplying the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium to the detected hot\nintracluster gas for a range of cluster core radii, cluster sizes and for\ndifferent values of the Hubble constant. X-ray estimates of the lensing cluster\nmass provide a means to determine the cluster contribution to the deflection of\nrays originating from the quasar Q0957+561. The present mass estimates were\nused to evaluate the convergence parameter kappa, the ratio of the local\nsurface mass density of the cluster to the critical surface mass density for\nlensing. The convergence parameter, kappa, calculated in the vicinity of the\nlensed images, was found to range between 0.07 and 0.21, depending on the\nassumed cluster core radius and cluster extent. This range of uncertainty in\nkappa does not include possible systematic errors arising from the estimation\nof the cluster temperature through the use of the cluster\nluminosity-temperature relation and the assumption of spherical symmetry of the\ncluster gas. Applying this range of values of kappa to the lensing model of\nGrogin & Narayan (1996) for Q0957+561 but not accounting for uncertainties in\nthat model yields a range of values for the Hubble constant:67<H_0<82 km s^-1\nMpc^-1, for a time delay of 1.1 years.",

We prove that\nthe categories of weak, weak admissible and ordinary g-twisted modules for the\ntensor product vertex operator algebra V^{\\otimes k} are isomorphic to the\ncategories of weak, weak admissible and ordinary V-modules, respectively. The\nmain result is an explicit construction of the weak g-twisted V^{\\otimes\nk}-modules from weak V-modules. For an arbitrary permutation automorphism g of\nV^{\\otimes k} the category of weak admissible g-twisted modules for V^{\\otimes\nk$ is semisimple and the simple objects are determined if V is rational.

    "summary": "It is by now established that, remarkably, the addition of noise to a\nnonlinear system may sometimes facilitate, rather than hamper the detection of\nweak signals. This phenomenon, usually referred to as stochastic resonance, was\noriginally associated with strictly periodic signals, but it was eventually\nshown to occur for stationary aperiodic signals as well. However, in several\nsituations of practical interest, the signal can be markedly nonstationary. We\ndemonstrate that the phenomenon of stochastic resonance extends to\nnonstationary signals as well, and thus could be relevant to a wider class of\nbiological and electronic applications. Building on both nondynamic and\naperiodic stochastic resonance, our scheme is based on a multilevel trigger\nmechanism, which could be realized as a parallel network of differentiated\nthreshold sensors. We find that optimal detection is reached for a number of\nthresholds of order ten, and that little is gained by going much beyond that\nnumber. We raise the question of whether this is related to the fact that\nevolution has favored some fixed numbers of precisely this order of magnitude\nin certain aspects of sensory perception.",

The gas is\nturbulent with velocity dispersion of a few 100 km/s and cloud-cloud collisions\nlead to copious star formation. Although supernovae tend to produce outflows,\nmost of the gas is trapped in the gravity field of the starforming cluster\nitself and the central black hole. A hot (T=10^6-10^7 K) virialised phase of\nthis gas, comprising a few per cent of the total obscuring material, feeds the\ncentral engine of 10^7 solar masses through Bondi accretion, at a sub-Eddington\nrate appropriate for the luminosity of these objects. If starburst-obscured\nobjects give rise to the residual XRB, then only 10 per cent of the accretion\nin active galaxies occurs close to the Eddington limit in unabsorbed objects.",

We present a theory of photon-assisted electron transport which is\ncharge and current conserving for all Fourier components of the current. We\nfind that the photo-current can be considered as an up- and down-conversion of\nthe harmonic potentials associated with the displacement currents. As an\nexample explicit calculations are presented for a resonant double barrier\ncoupled to two reservoirs and capacitively coupled to a gate. Two experimental\nsituations are considered: in the first case the ac-field is applied via a\ngate, and in the second case one of the contact potentials is modulated. For\nthe first case we show that the relative weight of the conduction sidebands\nvaries with the screening properties of the system. In contrast to the\nnon-interacting case the relative weights are not determined by Bessel\nfunctions. Moreover, interactions can give rise to an asymmetry between\nabsorption and emission peaks. In the contact driven case, the theory predicts\na zero-bias current proportional to the asymmetry of the double barrier. This\nis in contrast to the discussion of Tien and Gordon which, in violation of\nbasic symmetry principles, predicts a zero-bias current also for a symmetric\ndouble barrier.",

This divergence is likely to be an artefact of taking into\naccount only the leading order term in the $1 \\over N$ expansion when we\ncalculate the photon propagator and is handled here phenomenologically by means\nof an infrared cutoff. Inserting both the longitudinal and the transverse part\nof the photon propagator in the Schwinger-Dyson equation we find the dependence\nof the dynamically generated fermion mass on the temperature and the cutoff\nparameters. It turns out that consistency with certain statistical physics\narguments imposes conditions on the cutoff parameters. For parameters in the\nallowed range of values we find that the ratio $r=2*Mass(T=0)/critical\ntemperature$ is approximately 6, consistently with previous calculations which\nneglected the transverse photon contribution.",

These observations do not reveal any additional\nPMS candidates in 40' fields centered on HD 98800 and CD-33_7795. Hipparcos\nobservations of TW Hya (Wichmann et al. 1998) and HD 98800 (Soderblom et al.\n1998) show that both stars are roughly 50 pc away and are PMS with ages of ~\n10^7 yr. We searched the Hipparcos catalog (complete down to ~ 2-3 L_sun at\nthis distance) for other PMS stars in the same area. In a 10-pc radius volume\nof space centered on the previously known PMS stars, we find one additional\ncandidate PMS star (CD-36_7429) with a low space velocity, X-ray emission\ncomparable to that of HD 98800, and Li absorption. There are eight other stars\nin this area that have dwarf spectral types and lie above the main sequence,\nbut based on their weak X-ray emission, high space velocities, and lack of Li\nin low-resolution spectra (i.e. EW(Li) < 0.1 Angstroms), these are probably\nmis-classified subgiants or giants. The current positions and proper motions of\nTW Hya, HD 98800, and CD-36_7429 are inconsistent with them having formed as a\ngroup.",

The observed\nhelium abundance trends show no such correlations, though the nitrogen--oxygen\ntrend does show strong evidence for real scatter beyond observational error. We\nconstruct simple models for the chemical evolution of these galaxies, using the\nmost recent yields of \\he4, C, N and O in intermediate- and high-mass stars.\nThe effects of galactic outflows, which can arise both from bulk heating and\nevaporation of the ISM, and from the partial escape of enriched supernova\nejecta are included. In agreement with other studies, we find that\nsupernova-enriched outflows can roughly reproduce the observed He, C, N, and O\ntrends; however, in models that fit N versus O, the slopes $\\Delta Y/\\Delta$O\nand $\\Delta Y/\\Delta$N consistently fall more than $2\\sigma$ below the fit to\nobservations. We discuss the role of the models and their uncertainties in the\nextrapolation of primordial helium from the data.

It is in fact a good approximation to treat the system as having\nzero vorticity, i.e., as irrotational. Because the orbital period is much\nshorter than the radiation reaction time scale, it is also an excellent\napproximation to treat the system as evolving through a sequence of equilibrium\nstates, in each of which the gravitational radiation is neglected. In Newtonian\ngravity, one can simplify the hydrodynamic equations considerably for an\nequilibrium irrotational binary by introducing a velocity potential. The\nequations reduce to a Poisson-like equation for the potential, and a\nBernoulli-type integral for the density. We show that a similar simplification\ncan be carried out in general relativity.

However, the spectrum of particles accelerated at the jet side\nboundary is expected to be much flatter than the one formed at the shock. Due\nto this fact, particles accelerated at the boundary can dominate the overall\nspectrum at highest energies. In conditions characteristic to extragalactic\njets' terminal shocks, the mechanism naturally provides the particles with E ~\n10^20 eV and complies with the efficiency requirements. The spectrum formation\nnear the cut-off energy due to action of both the shock acceleration and the\ntangential discontinuity acceleration is modelled with the Monte Carlo particle\nsimulations.

    "summary": "We discuss how detection of gamma-ray emission from the decay of r-process\nnuclei can improve our understanding of r-process nucleosynthesis. We find that\na gamma-ray detector with a sensitivity of 10**(-7)/cm**2/s at 100-700 keV may\ndetect the emission from the decay of Sb125, Cs137, Ce144, Eu155, and Os194\nproduced in a future Galactic supernova. In addition, such a detector may\ndetect the emission from the decay of Sn126 in the Vela supernova remnant and\nthe diffuse emission from the decay of Sn126 produced by past supernovae in our\nGalaxy. The required detector sensitivity is similar to what is projected for\nthe proposed Advanced Telescope for High Energy Nuclear Astrophysics (ATHENA).\nBoth the detection of gamma-ray emission from the decay of several r-process\nnuclei (e.g., Sb125 and Os194) produced in future Galactic supernovae and the\ndetection of emission from the decay of Sn126 in the Vela supernova remnant\nwould prove that supernovae are a site of the r-process. Furthermore, the\nformer detection would allow us to determine whether or not the r-process\nnuclei are produced in relative proportions specified by the solar r-process\nabundance pattern in supernova r-process events. Finally, detection of diffuse\nemission from the decay of Sn126 in our Galaxy would eliminate neutron\nstar/neutron star mergers as the main source for the r-process nuclei near mass\nnumber A=126.",

The\nimages allow us to study the nebula with a physical resolution that is within a\nfactor of two of that typical of ground based observations of Galactic H II\nregions. Most of the emission within 30 Dor is confined to a thin zone located\nbetween the hot interior of the nebula and surrounding dense molecular\nmaterial. This zone appears to be directly analogous to the photoionized\nphotoevaporative flows that dominate emission from small, nearby H II regions.\nThe dynamical effects of the photoevaporative flow can be seen. The ram\npressure in the photoevaporative flow, derived from thermal pressure at the\nsurface of the ionization front, is found to balance with the pressure in the\ninterior of the nebula derived from previous x-ray observations. By analogy\nwith the comparison of ground and HST images of M16 we infer that the same\nsharply stratified structure seen in HST images of M16 almost certainly\nunderlies the observed structure in 30 Dor. 30 Doradus is a crucial case\nbecause it allows us to bridge the gap between nearby H II regions and the\ngiant H II regions seen in distant galaxies. The real significance of this\nresult is that it demonstrates that the physical understanding gained from\ndetailed study of photoevaporative interfaces in nearby H II regions can be\napplied directly to interpretation of giant H II regions.",

Raman scattering\naccompanied by the analogous two-exciton recombination (or creation) is also\nanalyzed. The excess momentum equal to the change of the electromagnetic field\nmomentum in these processes can be transferred to phonons or impurities. The\nprocesses under consideration take place if there is Bose condensation in the\ninteracting exciton system, and, therefore, can be used as a new method to\nreveal exciton Bose condensation. If the frequency of the incident light\n$\\omega< 2\\Omega$ ($\\Omega$ is the frequency corresponding to the recombination\nof an exciton with p=0), the coherent two-exciton recombination with the excess\nmomentum elastically transferred to impurities leads to the appearance of the\nspectral line $2\\Omega-\\omega$ corresponding to the induced two-photon\nemission.

The complex\nemission spectra of these sources are an ideal target for the BeppoSAX\ninstrumentation, that can measure the emission spectra in an unprecedented\nbroad energy band. Using this capability of BeppoSAX a detailed observational\nwork can be done on the galactic X-ray pulsars. In particular the 0.1-200 keV\nenergy band allows the shape of the continuum emission to be tightly\nconstrained. A better determination of the underlying continuum allows an\neasier detection of features superimposed onto it, both at low energy (Fe K and\nL, Ne lines) and at high energies (cyclotron features). We report on the\nspectral properties of a sample of X-ray pulsars observed with BeppoSAX\ncomparing the obtained results. Some ideas of common properties are also\ndiscussed and compared with our present understanding of the emission\nmechanisms and processes.",

A continuum mean field\napproach is used for calculating numerically concentration profiles between two\nelectrodes held at a constant potential. A generalized contact theorem relates\nthe inter-surface forces to the concentration profiles. The numerical results\nshow that over-compensation of the surface charges by adsorbing\npolyelectrolytes can lead to effective attraction between equally charged\nsurfaces. Simple scaling arguments enable us to characterize qualitatively the\ninter-surface interactions as function of the fraction of charged monomers p\nand the salt concentration c_b. In the low salt regime we find strong repulsion\nat short distances, where the polymers are depleted from the inter-surface gap,\nfollowed by strong attraction when the two adsorbed layers overlap. The\nmagnitude of this attraction scales as p^{1/2} and its dominant length scale is\nproportional to a/p^{1/2}, where a is the monomer size. At larger distances the\ntwo adsorbing surfaces interact via a weak electrostatic repulsion. For strong\npolyelectrolytes at high salt concentration the polymer contribution to\nattraction at short distances scales as p/c_b^{1/2} and the length scale is\nproportional to kappa*a^2/p, where kappa^{-1} is the Debye-Huckel screening\nlength. For weak polyelectrolytes at high salt concentration the interaction is\nrepulsive for all surface separations and decays exponentially with a decay\nlength equal to kappa^{-1}. The effect of irreversible adsorption is discussed\nas well and it is shown that inter-surface attraction can be obtained in this\ncase as well.",

    "summary": "We investigate a one--dimensional wire of interacting electrons connected to\none--dimensional noninteracting leads in the absence and in the presence of a\nbackscattering potential. The ballistic wire separates the charge and spin\nparts of an incident electron even in the noninteracting leads. The Fourier\ntransform of nonlocal correlation functions are computed for $T\\gg \\omega$. In\nparticular, this allows us to study the proximity effect, related to the\nAndreev reflection. A new type of proximity effect emerges when the wire has\nnormally a tendency towards Wigner crystal formation. The latter is suppressed\nby the leads below a space--dependent crossover temperature; it gets dominated\neverywhere by the $2k_F$ CDW at $T<L^{3/2 (K-1)}$ for short range interactions\nwith parameter $K<1/3$. The lowest--order renormalization equations of a weak\nbackscattering potential are derived explicitly at finite temperature. A\nperturbative expression for the conductance in the presence of a potential with\narbitrary spatial extension is given. It depends on the interactions, but is\nalso affected by the noninteracting leads, especially for very repulsive\ninteractions, $K<1/3$. This leads to various regimes, depending on temperature\nand on $K$. For randomly distributed weak impurities, we compute the\nconductance fluctuations, equal to that of $R=g-2e^2 /h$. While the behavior of\n$Var(R)$ depends on the interaction parameters, and is different for electrons\nwith or without spin, and for $K<1/3$ or $K>1/3$, the ratio $Var(R)/R^2$ stays\nalways of the same order: it is equal to $L_T/L\\ll 1$ in the high temperature\nlimit, then saturates at 1/2 in the low temperature limit, indicating that the\nrelative fluctuations of $R$ increase as one lowers the temperature.",

In the present paper, we propose an alternative way of solving the\ngeneral relativistic hydrodynamic equations in background (fixed) black hole\nspacetimes. We identify classes of coordinates in which the (possibly rotating)\nblack hole metric is free of coordinate singularities at the horizon,\nindependent of time, and admits a spacelike decomposition. In the spherically\nsymmetric, non-rotating case, we re-derive exact solutions for dust and perfect\nfluid accretion in Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates, and compare with\nnumerical hydrodynamic integrations.

For this purpose\nthe net generation number, i.e. half the third Chern class, is computed from\ndata related to the heterotic vector bundle in the spectral cover description;\na non-technical introduction to that method is supplied. This invariant is, in\nthe class of bundles considered, shown to be related to a discrete modulus\nwhich is the heterotic analogue of the $F$-theory four-flux. We consider also\nthe relevant matter which is supported along certain curves in the base $B$ and\nderive the net generation number again from the independent matter-related\ncomputation. We then illustrate these considerations with two applications.\nFirst we show that the construction leads to numerous 3 generation models of\nunbroken gauge group $SU(5), SO(10)$ or $E_6$. Secondly we discuss the closely\nrelated issue of the heterotic 5-brane/instanton transition resp. the\nF-theoretic 3-brane/instanton transition. The extra chiral matter in these\ntransitions is related to the Hecke transform of the direct sum of the original\nbundle and the dissolved 5-brane along the intersection of their spectral\ncovers. Finally we point to the corresponding $F$-theory interpretation of\nchiral matter from the intersection of 7-branes where the influence of\nfour-flux on the twisting along the intersection curve plays a crucial role.",

The\nnumerical method is then described in more detail. Following sections are\ndevoted to various static and dynamical properties of the t-J model. Among\nthermodynamic properties the chemical potential, entropy and the specific heat\nare evaluated. Discussing electrical properties the emphasis is on the optical\nconductivity and the d.c. resistivity. Magnetic properties involve the static\nand dynamical spin structure factor, as measured via the susceptibility\nmeasurements, the NMR relaxation and the neutron scattering, as well as the\norbital current contribution. Follows the analysis of electron spectral\nfunctions, being studied in photoemission experiments. Finally we discuss\ndensity fluctuations, the electronic Raman scattering and the thermoelectric\npower. Whenever feasible a comparison with experimental data is performed. A\ngeneral conclusion is that the t-J model captures well the main features of\nanomalous normal-state properties of cuprates, for a number of quantities the\nagreement is even a quantitative one.

We also\nfind that tadpole improvement using mean links in Landau gauge results in\nsmaller discretization errors in the scalar glueball mass (as well as in the\nstatic quark potential), compared to when average plaquettes are used. The\npossibility is also raised that further improvement in the scalar glueball mass\nmay result when the coefficients of the operators which correct for\ndiscretization errors in the action are computed beyond tree level.",

We start by mapping the low lying spectrum of spin waves in the\nuniform ferromagnet onto that of free moving spin excitons, and then we study\ntheir scattering by the defect of charge. In the presence of this disturbance,\nthe local spin stiffness varies in space, and we translate it into an\ninhomogeneus metric in the Hilbert space supporting the excitons. An attractive\npotencial is then required to preserve the symmetry under global spin\nrotations, and it traps the excitons around the charged defect. The\nquasiparticle now carries a spin texture. Textures containing more than one\nexciton are described within a mean-field theory, the interaction among the\nexcitons being taken into account through a new renormalization of the metric.\nThe number of excitons actually bound depends on the Zeeman coupling, that\nplays the same role as a chemical potencial. For small Zeeman energies, the\ndefect binds many excitons which condensate. As the bound excitons have a unit\nof angular momentum, provided by the quantum of magnetic flux left unbalanced\nby the defect of charge, the resulting texture turns out to be a topological\nexcitation of charge 1. Its energy is that given by the non-linear sigma model\nfor the ground state in this topological sector, i.e. the texture is a\nskyrmion.",

We prove that the probability densities in the amplifying case\nare related to those in the absorbing case with the same magnitude of the\nimaginary part of the dielectric permeability by exact dual relationships. From\nthe analysis of the average reflectance that shows a nonmonotonic dependence on\nthe absorption or amplification parameter, we obtain a useful criterion for the\napplicability of the RPA.

In particular it verifies the selection\nrule that it cannot decay into two fundamental mesons. The $l_{q\\bar q}=1$\nhybrid may decay into two fundamental mesons, but with decay widths larger than\n1 GeV, which tells that they do not really exist as resonant states. Using a\nchromoharmonic potential, we find no mixing between the $l_g=1$ and $l_{c\\bar\nc}=1$. More realistic potentials might induce a strong mixing between them,\nimplying that no hybrid meson exist. If, on the contrary, such a strong mixing\ndoes not occur, we find, in agreement with the flux tube model, that only the\n$l_g=1$ appears as a real resonant state. In such a case, hybrid mesons may\nexist as resonances only if they are decoupled from the ground state channels,\nwhich explains the difficulty to observe them experimentally. We reconsider\naccordingly the Ono-Close-Page scenario of mixing between charmonium and\ncharmed-hybrid to explain the anomalies around 4.1 GeV.

On this basis, calculations are carried out\nof the abundance of 21 molecular species as function of redshift evaluating\nconsistently the molecular heating and cooling due to H2, HD and LiH molecules.\nOne of the major improvements of this work is the use of a better treatment of\nH recombination that leads to a reduction of a factor 2-3 in the abundance of\nelectrons and H+ at freeze-out, with respect to previous studies.

A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test indicates that the two binary populations do not\nresult from the same distibution at a significance level of 98%. Apparently,\nthe same physical conditions which facilitate the formation of massive stars\nalso facilitate the formation of closer binaries among low-mass stars, whereas\nphysical conditions unfavorable for the formation of massive stars lead to the\nformation of wider binaries among low-mass stars. The outcome of the binary\nformation process might be related to the internal turbulence and the angular\nmomentum of molecular cloud cores, magnetic field, the initial temperature\nwithin a cloud, or - most likely - a combination of all of these. We conclude\nthat the distribution of binary separations is not a universal quantity, and\nthat the broad distribution of binary separations observed among main-sequence\nstars can be explained by a superposition of more peaked binary distributions\nresulting from various star forming environments.

The transformation associates any\npoint in configuration space with the local minimum obtained by a geometry\noptimization started from that point, effectively removing transition state\nregions from the problem. However, unlike other methods based upon hypersurface\ndeformation, this transformation does not change the global minimum.

The Markov chain\naspect allows this method to perform acceptably even for high-dimensional\nproblems, where finding good importance sampling distributions would otherwise\nbe very difficult, while the use of importance weights ensures that the\nestimates found converge to the correct values as the number of annealing runs\nincreases. This annealed importance sampling procedure resembles the second\nhalf of the previously-studied tempered transitions, and can be seen as a\ngeneralization of a recently-proposed variant of sequential importance\nsampling. It is also related to thermodynamic integration methods for\nestimating ratios of normalizing constants. Annealed importance sampling is\nmost attractive when isolated modes are present, or when estimates of\nnormalizing constants are required, but it may also be more generally useful,\nsince its independent sampling allows one to bypass some of the problems of\nassessing convergence and autocorrelation in Markov chain samplers.",

We compare our results\nwith other N-body simulations and Fokker-Planck calculations. Our simulations,\nperformed on the GRAPE-4, employ up to 32,768 stars. The results are not in\nagreement with Fokker-Planck models, in the sense that the lifetimes of stellar\nsystems derived using the latter are an order of magnitude smaller than those\nobtained in our simulations. For our standard run, Fokker-Plank calculations\nobtained a lifetime of 0.28 Gyr, while our equivalent N-body calculations find\nabout 4 Gyr. The principal reason for the discrepancy is that a basic\nassumption of the Fokker-Plank approach is not valid for typical cluster\nparameters. The stellar evolution timescale is comparable to the dynamical\ntimescale, and therefore the assumption of dynamical equilibrium leads to an\noverestimate of the dynamical effects of mass loss. Our results suggest that\nthe region in parameter space for which Fokker-Planck studies of globular\ncluster evolution, including the effects of both stellar evolution and the\ngalactic tidal field, are valid is limited. The discrepancy is largest for\nclusters with short lifetimes.",

The apparent velocity dispersion rises from 95 +- 2 km/s at 1\" <= r <=\n4\" to 178 +- 10 km/s at the center. To search for a central black hole, we\nderive three-dimensional velocity and velocity dispersion fields that fit our\nobservations and Hubble Space Telescope surface photometry after projection and\nseeing convolution. Isotropic models imply that the mass-to-light ratio rises\nby a factor of ~ 4 at r < 2\" to M/L_V > 10. If the mass-to-light ratio of the\nstars is constant with radius, then NGC 3377 contains a central massive dark\nobject (MDO), probably a black hole, of mass (1.8 +- 0.8) x 10**8 M_Sun.\nSeveral arguments suggest that NGC 3377 is likely to be nearly isotropic.\nHowever, flattened, anisotropic maximum entropy models can fit the data without\nan MDO. Therefore the MDO detection in NGC 3377 is weaker than those in M31,\nM32, or NGC 3115. The above MDO mass is corrected for the E5 shape of the\ngalaxy and for the difference between velocity moments and velocities given by\nGaussian fits to the line profiles. We show that the latter correction does not\naffect the strength of the MDO detection, but it slightly reduces the mass and\nmass-to-light ratio. At 3\" <= r <= 35\", M/L_V is constant at ~ 2.4.

    "summary": "The interplay of disorder and spin-fluctuation effects in a disordered\nantiferromagnet is studied. In the weak-disorder regime (W \\le U), while the\nenergy gap decreases rapidly with disorder, the sublattice magnetization,\nincluding quantum corrections, is found to remain essentially unchanged in the\nstrong correlation limit. Magnon energies and Neel temperature are enhanced by\ndisorder in this limit. A single paradigm of disorder-enhanced delocalization\nqualitatively accounts for all these weak disorder effects. Vertex corrections\nand magnon damping, which appear only at order (W/U)^4, are also studied. With\nincreasing disorder a crossover is found at W \\sim U, characterized by a rapid\ndecrease in sublattice magnetization due to quenching of local moments, and\nformation of spin vacancies. The latter suggests a spin-dilution behavior,\nwhich is indeed observed in softened magnon modes, lowering of Neel\ntemperature, and enhanced transverse spin fluctuations.",

We will analyze the stability of the\nSDG state in presence of randomness. We will compare these results with those\nobtained in the one-dimensional Heisenberg-Kondo lattice model (1D HKLM) where\nthe spins are coupled through a large Heisenberg exchange. Away from\nhalf-filling, the system is metallic and yields a very small spin gap which is\nequal to the one-impurity Kondo gap $T_k^{(imp)}$. Unlike the one-impurity\nKondo model, we will show why this Kondo phase cannot rule the fixed point of\nthe 1D KLM, away from half-filling. We will rather obtain a normal\nheavy-fermion state controlled by the energy scale $T_{coh}\\sim\n(T_k^{(imp)})^2/t$ (t is the hopping term) with a quite long-range\nantiferromagnetic polarization.

We generate the MAHs for a\nGaussian density fluctuation field, and we calculate the gravitational collapse\nand virialization of the dark halos. Assuming detailed angular momentum\nconservation, disks in centrifugal equilibrium are built-up within them. The\ndisk galactic evolution is followed through a physically self-consistent\napproach. The main disk galaxy properties and their correlations are determined\nby the mass, the MAH, and the spin parameter. The models give exponential disk\nsurface brightness (SB) profiles with realistic parameters (including LSB\ngalaxies), nearly flat rotation curves, and negative gradients in the B-V\nradial profile. The main trends across the Hubble sequence are reproduced. A\nmaximum in the star formation rate for most of the models is attained at z~\n1.5-2.5 (this rate is approximately 2.5-4.0 times larger than the present one).\nThe scale radii and the bulge-to-total ratios decrease with z, while the\ncentral SB increase. The B-band TF relation remains almost the same at\ndifferent redshifts.

However, it is shown that even if the AXJ2239-0429 has a cooling flow in\nthe central region, the temperature measured by ASCA which is the mean\nemission-weighted cluster temperature in this case, should not be cooler than\nand different from the virial temperature of the cluster. Therefore, we\nconclude that the effect of the clumpiness and non-zero ellipticity in the mass\ndistribution of the cluster are essential to explain the observed feature of\nthe giant luminous arc, and there is no discrepancy between strong lensing and\nX-ray estimation of the mass of the cluster in this cluster.",

We explain the relation between this\nvector superfield coupling and the \"holomorphic\" gauge coupling, which is a\nchiral superfield running only at 1 loop. We consider these issues for a number\nof regulators, including dimensional reduction. With this method, the\nrenormalization group equations for soft supersymmetry breaking terms are\ndirectly related to supersymmetric beta functions and anomalous dimensions to\nall orders in perturbation theory. However, the real power of the formalism\nlies in computing finite soft breaking effects corresponding to high-loop\ncomponent calculations.

The charged Higgs mechanism\nnot only accounts for the measured value of the CP-violating parameter\n$\\epsilon$ but also accommodates the current limits on $\\epsilon'/\\epsilon$.\nOur model naturally prevents tree-level Flavor-Changing Neutral Currents\n(FCNCs) of any kind. Unlike the Weinberg-Branco Three-Higgs Doublet Model, the\ndeviation from the Standard Model rate for $b\\to s\\gamma$ is small.\nFurthermore, leading contributions to the electron (neutron) electric dipole\nmoment are non-zero beginning at the three (two) loop level. Surprisingly\nsimilar to the Standard Kobayashi-Maskawa Model, our model is of milliweak\ncharacter but with seemingly superweak phenomenology.",

After scaling the gas fraction values to the r_500 radius (Evrard,\nMetzler & Navarro 1996), we find an apparent decrease in gas fractions at high\nredshifts, which can be scaled back to the mean gas fraction value at z ~ 0.1\nto 0.2 of (0.060 \\pm 0.002) h^{-3/2}, when \\Omega_m = 0.55^{+0.35}_{-0.23}\n(1-\\sigma statistical error, \\Omega_m + \\Omega_{\\Lambda} =1).

This is one of the\nlargest X-ray selected cluster samples, comparable in size only to the ROSAT\nAll-Sky Survey sample of nearby clusters (Ebeling et al. 1997). We detect\nclusters in the inner 17.5 arcmin of the ROSAT PSPC field of view using the\nspatial extent of their X-ray emission. Cluster X-ray luminosities range from\n10^42 erg/s to ~5x10^44 erg/s, i.e. from poor groups to rich clusters. The\ncluster redshifts range from z=0.015 to z>0.5. The catalog lists X-ray fluxes,\ncore-radii, spectroscopic redshifts for 73 clusters and photometric redshifts\nfor the remainder. We have optically confirmed 200 of 223 X-ray sources as\nclusters of galaxies. Of the remaining 23 sources, 18 are likely false\ndetections arising from blends of unresolved point X-ray sources, and for 5 we\nhave not obtained deep CCD images. Above a flux of 2e-13 erg/s/cm**2, 98\\% of\nextended X-ray sources are optically confirmed clusters. The log N-log S\nrelation derived from our catalog shows excellent agreement with previous\nresults: EMSS and ROSAT All-Sky survey BCS in teh bright end and WARPS at\nintermediate fluxes. Our cluster counts appear to be systematically higher than\nthose from a 50 deg^2 survey of Rosati et al. (1998). In particular, at a flux\nof 2e-13 erg/s/cm**2, we find a surface density of clusters of 0.57+/-0.07 per\nsquare degree, which is a factor of 1.3 more than found by Rosati et al. This\ndifference is marginally significant at the ~2 sigma level. The large area of\nour survey makes it possible to study the evolution of the X-ray luminosity\nfunction in the high luminosity range inaccessible with other, smaller area\nROSAT surveys.",

The ZAHB and TRGB distances to resolved galaxies are in good\nagreement, whereas the comparison between TRGB and Cepheid distances, computed\nby using the calibration suggested by Madore & Freedman (1991), reveals a\nsystematic discrepancy of the order of 0.12 mag. The TRGB distances are\nsystematically longer in comparison with the Cepheid ones. This result supports\nthe case for a revision of the zero point of the Cepheid distance scale, as\nalready suggested by other authors on the basis of HIPPARCOS parallaxes. The\napplication of our TRGB distance scale to NGC3379, provides a new distance to\nthe Leo I group, which coupled with recent independent determinations of the\ndistance Coma cluster-Leo I, provides a determination of H_0 at the Coma\ncluster in the range: H_0= 60+-11 Km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}.",

The\nchaining occurs, e.g., in a large nematic drop with homeotropic boundary\nconditions at all the surfaces. Between each pair of water droplets a point\ndefect in the liquid crystalline order was found in accordance with topological\nconstraints. This point defect causes a repulsion between the water droplets.\nIn our numerical investigation we limit ourselves to a chain of two droplets.\nFor such a complex geometry we use the method of finite elements to minimize\nthe Frank free energy. We confirm an experimental observation that the distance\nd of the point defect from the surface of a water droplet scales with the\nradius r of the droplet like d = 0.3 * r. When the water droplets are moved\napart, we find that the point defect does not stay in the middle between the\ndroplets, but rather forms a dipole with one of them. This confirms a\ntheoretical model for the chaining. Analogies to a second order phase\ntransition are drawn. We also find the dipole when one water droplet is\nsuspended in a bipolar nematic drop with two boojums, i.e., surface defects at\nthe outer boundary. Finally, we present a configuration where two droplets\nrepel each other without a defect between them.",

    "summary": "Lithium is an excellent tracer of mixing in stars as it is destroyed (by\nnuclear reactions) at a temperature around $\\sim 2.5\\times 10^6$ K. The lithium\ndestruction zone is typically located in the radiative region of a star. If the\nradiative regions are stable, the observed surface value of lithium should\nremain constant with time. However, comparison of the meteoritic and\nphotospheric Li abundances in the Sun indicate that the surface abundance of Li\nin the Sun has been depleted by more than two orders of magnitude. This is not\npredicted by solar models and is a long standing problem. Observations of Li in\nopen clusters indicate that Li depletion is occurring on the main sequence.\nFurthermore, there is now compelling observational evidence that a spread of\nlithium abundances is present in nearly identical stars. This suggests that\nsome transport process is occurring in stellar radiative regions. Helioseismic\ninversions support this conclusion, for they suggest that standard solar models\nneed to be modified below the base of the convection zone. There are a number\nof possible theoretical explanations for this transport process. The relation\nbetween Li abundances, rotation rates and the presence of a tidally locked\ncompanion along with the observed internal rotation in the Sun indicate that\nthe mixing is most likely induced by rotation. The current status of\nnon-standard (particularly rotational) stellar models which attempt to account\nfor the lithium observations are reviewed.",

Examples we cite include a new type of black\nhole superradiance.

We work out in full detail the\nelectrodynamics of a Zel'dovich rotating cylinder, including a general\nelectrodynamic proof of the Zel'dovich--Misner condition, and explicit\ncalculations of the superradiant gain for both types of polarization. Contrary\nto Zel'dovich's pessimistic conclusion we conclude that, if the cylinder is\nsurrounded by a dielectric jacket and the whole assembly is placed inside a\nrotating cavity, the superradiance is measurable in the laboratory.",

For approximately equipartition magnetic\nfields, the turbulence primarily heats the electrons. For weaker magnetic\nfields, the protons are primarily heated. The division between electron and\nproton heating occurs between $\\beta \\sim 5$ and $\\beta \\sim 100$ (where\n$\\beta$ is the ratio of the gas to the magnetic pressure), depending on unknown\ndetails of how Alfv\\'en waves are converted into whistlers on scales of the\nproton Larmor radius.

There exists a\nclose relation between the choice of vacuum for the matter fields and the\nselection of a basis of the Hilbert space of anti-de Sitter wormholes. In the\npresence of conformal matter (i.e., conformal scalar or electromagnetic\nfields), this relation allows us to interpret the elements of these bases as\nwormhole states containing a given number of particles. This interpretation is\nsubject to the same kind of ambiguity in the definition of particle as that\narising from quantum field theory in curved spacetime. In the case of\ngravitons, owing to the non-conformal coupling, it is not possible to describe\nwormhole states in terms of their particle content.",

    "summary": "(abridged) The velocity distribution f(v) of nearby stars is estimated, via a\nmaximum- likelihood algorithm, from the positions and tangential velocities of\na kinematically unbiased sample of 14369 stars observed by the HIPPARCOS\nsatellite. f(v) shows rich structure in the radial and azimuthal motions, v_R\nand v_phi, but not in the vertical velocity, v_z: there are four prominent and\nmany smaller maxima, many of which correspond to well known moving groups.\nWhile samples of early-type stars are dominated by these maxima, also up to 25%\nof red main-sequence stars are associated with them. These moving groups are\nresponsible for the vertex deviation measured even for samples of late-type\nstars; they appear more frequently for ever redder samples; and as a whole they\nfollow an asymmetric-drift relation, in the sense that those only present in\nred samples predominantly have large |v_R| and lag in v_phi w.r.t. the local\nstandard of rest (LSR). The question arise, how these old moving groups got on\ntheir eccentric orbits. A plausible mechanism, known from solar system\ndynamics, which is able to manage a shift in orbit space involves locking into\nan orbital resonance.\n  Apart from these moving groups, there is a smooth background distribution,\nakin to Schwarzschild's ellipsoidal model, with axis ratio of about 1:0.6:0.35\nin v_R, v_phi, and v_z. The contours are aligned with the $v_r$ direction, but\nnot w.r.t. the v_phi and v_z axes: the mean v_z increases for stars rotating\nfaster than the LSR. This effect can be explained by the stellar warp of the\nGalactic disk. If this explanation is correct, the warp's inner edge must not\nbe within the solar circle, while its pattern rotates with frequency of about\n13 km/s/kpc or more retrograde w.r.t. the stellar orbits.",

However, we found that even for models which exhibit\nquite a different formation history, the density and velocity dispersion\nprofiles of the virialized halos are strikingly similar.\n  Power law density profiles do not result even in models with initial power\nlaw profiles and no initial substructure or non-radial motions. Such initial\nconditions give rise to a radial orbit instability which leads to curved\nvelocity dispersion and density profiles. The shapes of the density profiles in\nall our models are well parameterized by the profiles of halos formed in a\ngeneric cosmological setting. Our results show that the universality of dark\nhalo density profiles does not depend crucially on hierarchical merging as has\nbeen suggested recently in the literature. Rather it arises because apparently\ndifferent collapse histories produces a near universal angular momentum\ndistribution among the halo particles.

    "summary": "We use the two-point correlation function to calculate the clustering\nproperties of the recently completed SSRS2 survey. The redshift space\ncorrelation function for the magnitude-limited SSRS2 is given by xi(s)=(s/5.85\nh-1 Mpc)^{-1.60} for separations between 2 < s < 11 h-1 Mpc, while our best\nestimate for the real space correlation function is xi(r) = (r/5.36 h-1\nMpc)^{-1.86}. Both are comparable to previous measurements using surveys of\noptical galaxies over much larger and independent volumes. By comparing the\ncorrelation function calculated in redshift and real space we find that the\nredshift distortion on intermediate scales is small. This result implies that\nthe observed redshift-space distribution of galaxies is close to that in real\nspace, and that beta = Omega^{0.6}/b < 1, where Omega is the cosmological\ndensity parameter and b is the linear biasing factor for optical galaxies. We\nalso use the SSRS2 to study the dependence of xi on the internal properties of\ngalaxies. We confirm earlier results that luminous galaxies (L>L*) are more\nclustered than sub-L* galaxies and that the luminosity segregation is\nscale-independent. We find that early types are more clustered than late types,\nbut that in the absence of rich clusters, the relative bias between early and\nlate types in real space, is not as strong as previously estimated.\nFurthermore, both morphologies present a luminosity-dependent bias, with the\nearly types showing a slightly stronger dependence on luminosity. We also find\nthat red galaxies are significantly more clustered than blue ones, with a mean\nrelative bias stronger than that seen for morphology. Finally, we find that the\nrelative bias between optical and iras galaxies in real space is b_o/b_I $\\sim$\n1.4.",

The major\ndifference between this work and previous work is that we use more recent\nopacity data from the OPAL project. Since, in general, these opacities are\nhigher than those available ten years ago, at a given effective temperature,\nconvection zones go deeper than in models with older opacity data. Thus\nconvective dredge-up of observationally detectable carbon in helium atmosphere\nwhite dwarfs can occur for thicker helium layers than found by Pelletier et al\n(1986). We find that the range of observed C to He ratios in different DQ white\ndwarfs of similar effective temperature is well explained by a range of initial\nhelium layer mass between $10^{-3}$ and $10^{-2} M_{\\odot}$, in good agreement\nwith stellar evolution theory, assuming a typical white dwarf mass of $0.6\nM_{\\odot}$. We also predict that oxygen will be present in DQ white dwarf\natmospheres in detectable amounts if the helium layer mass is near the lower\nlimit compatible with stellar evolution theory. Determination of the oxygen\nabundance has the potential of providing information on the profile of oxygen\nin the core and hence on the important $^{12}$C$(\\alpha,\\gamma)^{16}$O reaction\nrate.",

An unresolved central continuum source in our\nHST images is a virtually perfect indicator of a Sy1 spectrum. 52% of these Sy1\npoint sources are saturated in our images; we use their wings to estimate their\nmagnitudes. The converse is not however true, as over a third of Sy's with\ndirect spectroscopic evidence for broad Balmer wings show no nuclear point\nsource. Like the Sy2's, they have central surface brightnesses consistent with\nthose expected for the bulges of normal galaxies. The frequency of bars in\nSy1's and 2's and non-Sys are the same. The Sy2 galaxies are significantly more\nlikely to show nuclear dust absorption, especially in lanes and patches which\nare irregular or reach close to the nucleus. The difference cannot be explained\nby different average redshifts or selection techniques. This is confirmed by\nour morphology classifications, which show that Sy1 nuclei reside in earlier\ntype galaxies than Sy2 nuclei. This intrinsic difference in host galaxy\nproperties may undermine the strong unification hypothesis for Sy galaxies that\nthey appear different due to the orientation of their central engine. The\nexcess galactic dust we see in Sy2's may cause substantial absorption which\nobscures their hypothesized broad emission-line regions and central nonstellar\ncontinua. This galactic dust could produce much of the absorption in Sy2 nuclei\nwhich had instead been attributed to a thick dusty accretion torus.",

The Adaptive Matched Filter (AMF) method utilizes\ngalaxy positions, magnitudes, and---when available---photometric or\nspectroscopic redshifts to find clusters and determine their redshift and\nrichness. The AMF can be applied to most types of galaxy surveys: from\ntwo-dimensional (2D) imaging surveys, to multi-band imaging surveys with\nphotometric redshifts of any accuracy (2.5D), to three-dimensional (3D)\nredshift surveys. The AMF can also be utilized in the selection of clusters in\ncosmological N-body simulations. The AMF identifies clusters by finding the\npeaks in a cluster likelihood map generated by convolving a galaxy survey with\na filter based on a model of the cluster and field galaxy distributions. In\ntests on simulated 2D and 2.5D data with a magnitude limit of r' ~ 23.5,\nclusters are detected with an accuracy of Delta z ~ 0.02 in redshift and ~10%\nin richness to z < 0.5.

The main\nconclusion of this paper is that Ca II H- and K-line emission does occur among\nsubdwarfs. It is particularly notable among those subdwarfs with colours of B-V\n> 0.75; all such stars observed exhibit chromospheric emission, although\nemission is observed among some subdwarfs bluer than this colour. The Ca II K\nemission profile in most subdwarfs exhibits an asymmetry of V/R > 1, similar to\nthat seen in the integrated light of the solar disk. Two quantitative\nindicators of the contrast between the peaks in the emission profile and the\nneighbouring photospheric line profile are introduced. Measurements of these\nindicators show that the level of Ca II emission among the subdwarfs is similar\nto that among low-activity Population I dwarfs.",

By including the staggered gauge field fluctuation we\ncalculate the spectral function of the electrons by RPA(random phase\napproximation). The line shape of the spectral function near $(\\pi,0)$ is very\nbroad in underdoped case and is quite sharp in overdoped case. For the spectral\nfunction near $(0.5\\pi,0.5\\pi)$, the quasiparticle peaks are always very sharp\nin both underdoped and overdoped case. The temperature dependence of the\nspectral function is also discussed in our present calculation. These results\nfit well with the recent ARPES experiments. We also calculate the FS crossover\nfrom a small four segment like FS to a large continuous FS. The reason of such\nkind of FS crossover is ascribed to the staggered gauge field fluctuation which\nis strong in underdoped regime and becomes much weaker in overdoped regime. The\npseudo gap extracted from the ARPES data can be also interpreted by the\ncalculation.",

Emission lines are produced by\nthe combined effect of the Schuster mechanism and radiative interlocking, and\ncan be explained without the presence of a chromosphere. Silicon absorption\nlines and the L alpha profile set constraints on the presence of a\nchromosphere, excluding a strong temperature rise in layers deeper than tau_R ~\n10^{-4}.",

The second cloud, in contrast,\nhas detected AlII and AlIII (also SiIV and CII), but no detected SiII. We\ndemonstrate, using photoionization models, that Al/Si must be greater than\n(Al/Si)_Sun in this unusual cloud. Such a ratio is not found in absorption\nprofiles looking through Milky Way gas.

Radio observations were made using the Very Large Array in\nA-array configuration at 5 and 8 GHz, and using the MERLIN array at 1.4 and\n1.65 GHz. Radio spectral index, radio polarisation, and rotation measure maps\nare presented for both sources. Radio core candidates are detected in each\nsource, and by aligning these with the centroid of the infrared emission the\nradio and the optical/infrared images can be related astrometrically with 0.1\narcsec accuracy. In each source the radio core is located at a minimum of the\noptical emission, probably associated with a central dust lane. Both sources\nalso exhibit radio jets which lie along the directions of the bright strings of\noptical knots seen in high resolution Hubble Space Telescope images. The\nnorthern arm of 3C368 shows a close correlation between the radio and optical\nemission, whilst along the jet direction of 3C324 the bright radio and optical\nknots are co-linear but not co-spatial. These indicate that interactions\nbetween the radio jet and its environment play a key role in producing the\nexcess ultraviolet emission of these sources, but that the detailed mechanisms\nvary from source to source. 3C368 is strongly depolarised and has an average\nrest-frame rotation measure of a few hundred rad/m^2, reaching about 1000\nrad/m^2 close to the most depolarised regions. 3C324 has weaker depolarisation,\nand an average rest-frame rotation measure of between 100 and 200 rad/m^2. Both\nsources show large gradients in their rotation measure structures, with\nvariations of up to 1000 rad/m^2 over distances of about 10 kpc.",

By examining the set of objects grown in a\ncombined N-body plus smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulation with those\nobtained in similar models where some of the cold, dense gas was replaced by\ncollisionless ``star'' particles I show that it is possible to make this\nsubstitution without affecting the subsequent gas cooling rate. With even the\nmost basic star forming criteria the masses of isolated objects are nearly\nidentical to the mass of cold, dense gas found within the same objects in a\nnon-star forming run.\n  No evidence is found to support the contention that converting gas into stars\nmight affect the amount of cold gas obtained in a simulation by retarding the\ncooling rate within those objects where stars have already formed. In practice,\nbecause cold gas can be reheated by shocks but stars remain as such whatever\nhappens the masses of the largest objects found in the star forming runs are\ngenerally higher than those in the standard run.\n  Finally, I demonstrate that an excellent match to the observed star formation\nrate can be achieved with even a very basic star formation prescription.",

    "summary": "It is well known, that the causal Schr\\\"odinger evolution of a quantum state\nis not compatible with the reduction postulate, even when decoherence is taken\ninto account. The violation of the causal evolution, introduced by the standard\nreduction postulate distinguishes certain systems (as the measurement devices),\nwhose states are very close to statistical mixtures (as the ones resulting from\nthe process of decoherence). In these systems, this violation has not any\nobservable effect. In arbitrary quantum systems, the transition from the\ninitial density matrix to a diagonal matrix predicted by the standard reduction\npostulate, would lead to a complete breakdown of the Schr\\\"odinger evolution,\nand consequently would destroy all the predictive power of quantum mechanics.\nWhat we show here, is that there is a modified version of the postulate that\nallows to treat all the quantum mechanical systems on equal footing. The\nstandard reduction postulate may be considered as a good approximation, useful\nfor practical purposes, of this modified version which is consistent with the\nSchr\\\"odinger evolution and via decoherence with the experimental results.\nWithin this approach, the physical role played by the reduction postulate is as\na tool for the computation of relative probabilities and consequently for the\ndetermination of the probabilities of consistent histories.",

Comparison of the rotational distributions of low-mass members between\nIC 2602/2391 and the Pleiades suggests that G dwarfs behave like solid-bodies\nand follow Skumanich's law during this time span. However, comparison between\nPleiades and older clusters (M34 and Hyades) indicates that the braking of slow\nrotators on the early main sequence is weaker than predicted by an asymptotical\nSkumanich's law. This strongly supports the view that angular momentum tapped\nin the radiative core of slow rotators on the zero age main sequence (ZAMS)\nresurfaces into the convective envelope between Pleiades and Hyades age. For\nthe G-dwarfs, we derive a characteristic coupling time scale between the core\nand the envelope of about 100--200Myr. The relationship between rotation and\ncoronal activity in the Pleiades is in agreement with previous observations in\nother clusters and field stars. We show that the Rossby diagram provides an\nexcellent description of the X-ray activity for all stars in the mass domain\nstudied. The Pleiades data for slow and moderate rotators fills the gap between\nthe X-ray--rotation correlation found for slow rotators and the X-ray\n``saturation plateau'' observed for young fast rotators.",

    "summary": "We propose a new framework for solving the hierarchy problem which does not\nrely on either supersymmetry or technicolor. In this framework, the\ngravitational and gauge interactions become united at the weak scale, which we\ntake as the only fundamental short distance scale in nature. The observed\nweakness of gravity on distances $\\gsim$ 1 mm is due to the existence of $n\n\\geq 2$ new compact spatial dimensions large compared to the weak scale. The\nPlanck scale $M_{Pl} \\sim G_N^{-1/2}$ is not a fundamental scale; its enormity\nis simply a consequence of the large size of the new dimensions. While\ngravitons can freely propagate in the new dimensions, at sub-weak energies the\nStandard Model (SM) fields must be localized to a 4-dimensional manifold of\nweak scale \"thickness\" in the extra dimensions. This picture leads to a number\nof striking signals for accelerator and laboratory experiments. For the case of\n$n=2$ new dimensions, planned sub-millimeter measurements of gravity may\nobserve the transition from $1/r^2 \\to 1/r^4$ Newtonian gravitation. For any\nnumber of new dimensions, the LHC and NLC could observe strong quantum\ngravitational interactions. Furthermore, SM particles can be kicked off our 4\ndimensional manifold into the new dimensions, carrying away energy, and leading\nto an abrupt decrease in events with high transverse momentum $p_T \\gsim$ TeV.\nFor certain compact manifolds, such particles will keep circling in the extra\ndimensions, periodically returning, colliding with and depositing energy to our\nfour dimensional vacuum with frequencies of $ \\sim 10^{12}$ Hz or larger. As a\nconcrete illustration, we construct a model with SM fields localised on the\n4-dimensional throat of a vortex in 6 dimensions, with a Pati-Salam gauge\nsymmetry $SU(4) \\times SU(2) \\times SU(2)$ in the bulk.",

    "summary": "The generic Berry phase scenario in which a two-level system is coupled to a\nsecond system whose dynamical coordinate is slowly-varying is generalized to\nallow for stochastic evolution of the slow system. The stochastic behavior is\nproduced by coupling the slow system to a heat resevoir which is modeled by a\nbath of harmonic oscillators initially in equilibrium at temperature T, and\nwhose spectral density has a bandwidth which is small compared to the\nenergy-level spacing of the fast system. The well-known energy-level shifts\nproduced by Berry's phase in the fast system, in conjunction with the\nstochastic motion of the slow system, leads to a broadening of the fast system\nenergy-levels. In the limit of strong damping and sufficiently low temperature,\nwe determine the degree of level-broadening analytically, and show that the\nslow system dynamics satisfies a Langevin equation in which Lorentz-like and\nelectric-like forces appear as a consequence of geometrical effects. We also\ndetermine the average energy-level shift produced in the fast system by this\nmechanism.",

A superlattice pattern (\"superlattice-I\")\nconsisting of two hexagonal lattices oriented at a relative angle of 22^o is\nobtained with a 6:7 ratio of forcing frequencies. Several theoretical\napproaches that may be useful in understanding this pattern have been proposed.\nIn another example, the waves are fully described by two superimposed hexagonal\nlattices with a wavelength ratio of sqrt(3), oriented at a relative angle of\n30^o. The time dependence of this \"superlattice-II\" wave pattern is unusual.\nThe instantaneous patterns reveal a time-periodic stripe modulation that breaks\nthe 6-fold symmetry at any instant, but the stripes are absent in the time\naverage. The instantaneous patterns are not simply amplitude modulations of the\nprimary standing wave. A transition from the superlattice-II state to a 12-fold\nquasi-crystalline pattern is observed by changing the relative phase of the two\nforcing frequencies.

The dimer and trimer spectra at $q=\\pi$ ar e\nfound to consist of single modes with $N$-independent excitation energies\n$\\omega_\\lambda^D/|e_0|=5$ and $\\omega_\\lambda^T/|e_0|=6$, where $e_0=E_0/N$ is\nthe ground-state energy per site. The basic structure of the dynamically\nrelevant excitation spectrum remains the same over a substantial parameter\nrange within the Haldane phase. At the transition to the dimerized phase\n($\\theta=-\\pi/4$), the two-magnon excitations turn into two-spinon excitations.",

The data\nwere compared to calculations with statistical multifragmentation models and to\nclassical three-body calculations. Classical trajectory calculations reproduce\nthe dynamical observables. The deduced breakup parameters, however, differ\nconsiderably from those assumed in the statistical multifragmentation models\nwhich describe the charge correlations.

The age\ndistribution clearly reveals the presence of a number of old Globular Clusters\n(GCs) from the parent galaxies. Their effective radii do not significantly\ndiffer from those of the young star cluster population. We confirm Meurer's\n(1995) conjecture that the shape of the LF changes in the course of evolution\nif age spread effects are accounted for. We find that over a Hubble time the\nobserved exponential LF of the young star clusters will evolve into a typical\nGaussian GCLF with parameters M$_{V_0} = -7.1$ mag and $\\sigma (M_{V_0}) = 1.3$\nmag. We discuss the influence of metallicity, the effects of an inhomogeneous\ninternal dust distribution, as well as the possible influence of internal --\nthrough stellar mass loss -- and external dynamical effects on the secular\nevolution of the LF. Referring YSC luminosities to a uniform age and combining\nwith model M/L, we recover the intrinsic mass distribution of the YSC system.\nIt is Gaussian in shape to good approximation thus representing a\nquasi-equilibrium distribution that $-$ according to Vesperini's (1997)\ndynamical modelling for the Milky Way GC system $-$ will not be altered in\nshape over a Hubble time of dynamical evolution, allthough a substantial number\nof clusters will be destroyed.

Counts of GPS sources in our sample as a function\nof flux density have been compared with counts of large scale sources from\nWENSS scaled to 2 GHz, the typical peak frequency of our GPS sources. The\ncounts can be made similar if the number of large scale sources at 2 GHz is\ndivided by 250, and their flux densities increase by a factor of 10. On the\nscenario that all GPS sources evolve into large scale radio sources, these\nresults show that the lifetime of a typical GPS source is ~250 times shorter\nthan a typical large scale radio source, and that the source luminosity must\ndecrease by a factor of ~10 in evolving from GPS to large scale radio source.\nHowever, we note that the redshift distributions of GPS and large scale radio\nsources are different and that this hampers a direct and straightforward\ninterpretation of the source counts.

In the ultraviolet, a\nfluctuation analysis shows that the flattening observed below U=26 mag is not\ndue to incompleteness and is more pronounced than in the other bands,\nconsistent with the idea that a redshift limit has been reached in the galaxy\ndistribution. A reddening trend of about 0.5 magnitude is observed at faint\nfluxes in the colour-magnitude diagram, (U-V)_{eff} vs. V. We interpret these\nresults as the effect of intergalactic attenuation on distant galaxies. At flux\nlevels of AB=27 mag and in agreement with the fluctuation analysis and the\ncolour-magnitude relation, about 7% of the sources in U, 30% in B and 35% in V\nare Lyman-break ``dropouts'', i.e. candidate star-forming galaxies at z>2. By\nintegrating the number counts to the limits of the HDF survey we find that the\nmean surface brightness of the extragalactic sky is dominated by galaxies that\nare relatively bright and are known to have <z>=0.6. To AB=29 mag, the\nintegrated light from resolved galaxies in the I-band is 2.1\\pm 0.4 \\times\n10^{-20} erg/cm^2/s/Hz/sr, and its spectrum is well described by a broken\npower-law. We discuss the predictions for the counts, colours, and luminosity\ndensities from standard low-q_0 pure-luminosity-evolution models without dust\nobscuration, and find that they are unable to reproduce all the observed\nproperties of faint field galaxies.",

This outburst was qualitatively quite\ndifferent to other SXT outbursts and to previous outbursts of this source. The\nonset of hard X-ray activity occurred very slowly, over several months and was\ndelayed relative to the soft X-ray rise. During this period, the optical fluxes\ndeclined steadily. This apparent anti-correlation is not consistent with the\nstandard disc instability model of SXT outbursts, nor is it expected if the\noptical output is dominated by reprocessing. Using our derived reddening we\nfind that our dereddened spectra are dominated by a component peaking in the\noptical with the expected nu^1/3 disc spectrum seen only in the UV. We consider\npossible interpretations of this spectrum in terms of thermal emission from the\nouter accretion disc and/or secondary star, both with and without X-ray\nirradiation, and also as non-thermal optical synchrotron emission from a\ncompact self-absorbed central source. The X-ray spectra broadly resemble the\nhigh-soft state commonly seen in black hole candidates, but evolve through two\nsubstates. The outburst dataset cannot readily be interpreted by any standard\nmodel for SXT outbursts. Many of the characteristics could be interpreted with\na model combining X-ray irradiation with the disc instability, but with the\nadded ingredient of a very large disc in this long period system.",

This has confirmed the earlier de\nVaucouleurs power-law density - distance relation, now corresponding to a\nfractal structure with dimension $D \\approx 2$, at least, in the range of\nscales $ \\sim 1 \\div 200 Mpc$ ($H_0 = 55 km/sec/Mpc$).

Second, since Hubble's\ndiscovery, the linear redshift-distance law has been well established within\n$200 Mpc$ and also much deeper. The co-existence of these laws within the same\nscales is a challenge for the standard cosmology where the linear Hubble law is\na strict consequence of homogeneity of the expanding universe.

    "summary": "It is shown how traditional development of theories of fluids based upon the\nconcept of physical clustering can be adapted to an alternative local\nclustering definition. The alternative definition can preserve a detailed\nvalence description of the interactions between a solution species and its\nnear-neighbors, i.e., cooperativity and saturation of coordination for strong\nassociation. These clusters remain finite even for condensed phases. The\nsimplest theory to which these developments lead is analogous to quasi-chemical\ntheories of cooperative phenomena. The present quasi-chemical theories require\nadditional consideration of packing issues because they don't impose lattice\ndiscretizations on the continuous problem. These quasi-chemical theories do not\nrequire pair decomposable interaction potential energy models. Since\ncalculations may be required only for moderately sized clusters, we suggest\nthat these quasi-chemical theories could be implemented with computational\ntools of current electronic structure theory. This can avoid an intermediate\nstep of approximate force field generation.",

By, essentially, comparing the\nfinite-volume heavy quark potential where the quarks are separated along a\nspatial direction with that where they are separated along the time direction,\nwe determine the relation between $\\xi$ and $\\xi_0$ to a fraction of 1% for\nweak and to 1% for strong coupling.

Processes requiring quantum penetration of a\npotential barrier include black hole pair creation and the decay of vacuum\ndomain walls. Ideally, one calculates the rates for such processes by finding\nan instanton, or Euclidean solution of the field equations, which interpolates\nbetween the initial and final states. In practice, however, it has become\ncustomary to calculate such amplitudes using the No-Boundary Proposal of Hartle\nand Hawking. A criticism of this method is that it does not use a single path\nwhich interpolates between the initial and final states, but two disjoint\ninstantons: One divides the probability to create the final state from nothing\nby the probability to create the initial state from nothing and decrees the\nanswer to be the rate of tunneling from the initial to the final state. Here,\nwe demonstrate the validity of this approach by constructing continuous paths\nconnecting the ingoing and outgoing data, which may be viewed as perturbations\nof the set of disconnected instantons. They are off-shell, but will still\ndominate the path integral as they have action arbitrarily close to the\nno-boundary action. In this picture, a virtual domain wall, or wormhole, is\ncreated and annihilated in such a way as to interface between the disjoint\ninstantons. Decay rates calculated using our construction differ from decay\nrates calculated using the No-Boundary Proposal only in the prefactor; the\nexponent, which usually dominates the result, remains unchanged.",

The\ncharacteristic feature is that the field operator describes solely the physical\ndegrees of freedom representing the deviation from the Laughlin state. It\npresents a powerful tool to analyze excited states within the \\LLL. It is shown\nthat all excitations are nonlocal topological solitons in the spinless quantum\nHall system. On the other hand, in the presence of the spin degree of freedom\nit is shown that a quantum coherence develops spontaneously, where excitations\ninclude a Goldstone mode besides nonlocal topological solitons. Solitons are\nvortices and Skyrmions carrying the U(1) and SU(2) topological charges,\nrespectively. Their classical configurations are derived from their microscopic\nwave functions. The Skyrmion appears merely as a low-energy excitation within\nthe \\LLL and not as a solution of the effective nonlinear sigma model. We use\nit as a consistency check of the Skyrmion theory that the Skyrmion is reduced\nto the vortex in the vanishing limit of the Skyrmion size. We evaluate the\nactivation energy of one Skyrmion and compare it with experimental data.",

The Vlasov stationary solution is shown to give the same\nconsistency equation of the canonical solution and its predictions for rotator\nangle and momenta distribution functions agree very well with numerical\nsimulations. A link is established between the behavior of the maximal Lyapunov\nexponent and that of thermodynamical fluctuations, expressed by kinetic energy\nfluctuations or specific heat. The extensivity of chaos in the $N \\to \\infty$\nlimit is tested through the scaling properties of Lyapunov spectra and of the\nKolmogorov-Sinai entropy.

This is a precisely defined\nphenomenon which motivates the basic picture of hadrons assumed in the MIT bag\nmodel, with nucleons as droplets of chiral symmetry restored phase. This\nsuggests that the phase transition to a chirally symmetric phase occurs by\npercolation of preexisting droplets of the symmetric phase, and in these\nproceedings we expand upon our previous presentation of this observation. At\nall densities high enough that the chirally symmetric phase fills space, color\nsymmetry is broken by the formation of a <qq> condensate of quark Cooper pairs.\nA plausible ordering scheme leads to a substantial gap in a Lorentz scalar\nchannel involving quarks of two colors.",

The resulting\nS-D equation for the fermion mass (at order 1/N) has an infrared divergence\nassociated with the contribution of the transverse photon propagator; only the\nlongitudinal contribution is retained, as in earlier treatments. For solutions\nof constant mass, it is found that the retardation reduces the value of the\nparameter r (the ratio of twice the mass to the critical temperature) from\nabout 10 to about 6.

The comparison of the FIR and UV local\nluminosity functions argues for a moderate extinction in nearby disk galaxies.\nFor a sample of 22 starburst galaxies, it is found that the UV(912-3650AA), the\nvisible(3600-12500 AA) and the NIR(12500-22000 AA) wavelength range contribute\n30%, 50% and 20% respectively to the total emerging stellar emission.

The mean extinction at\n2000AA is found to be ~1.2mag although with a large dispersion. The conversion\nfactor of the stellar emission into dust emission is found to correlate with\nthe luminosity of the galaxies, brighter galaxies having a higher conversion\nfactor. We conclude that a very large conversion of the stellar light into dust\nemission can no longer be assumed as a general property of starburst galaxies\nat least in the local Universe. We compare the UV properties of our local\nstarburst galaxies to those of high redshift galaxies.

To resolve this controversy, we study\nthe effect of a non-uniform magnetic field on the spin polarization and on the\nweak-localization effect.

In addition to Friedel oscillations, which are\nassociated to branch cuts in the $q$-plane, there appears another oscillatory\ncomponent, which arises from a pole on the pion propagator. This pole is\nlocated appart from the axes, giving rise to an oscillating Yukawa-like\npotential. Therefore, we call this phenomenon 'Yukawa oscillations'. This\nphenomenon does not appear in the Debye component of the QED screened\npotential, even if the coupling constant is artificially increased. We have\nalso studied a model of QCD quark-gluon plasma. In this case, the one-gluon\npropagator also shows this kind of poles.

The direct heating current is treated as an external driving force\nacting on each adatom. Numerical calculations show both qualitative and\nquantitative agreement with experiment. A force in the step down direction will\ndestabilize the uniform step train towards step bunching. The average size of\nthe step bunches grows with electromigration time as t^beta, with beta = 0.5,\nin agreement with experiment and with an analytical treatment of the steady\nstates. The model is extended to include the effect of direct hopping of\nadatoms between different terraces. Monte-Carlo simulations of a solid-on-solid\nmodel, using physically motivated assumptions about the dynamics of surface\ndiffusion and attachment at step edges, are carried out to study two\ndimensional features that are left out of the present step model and to test\nits validity. These simulations give much better agreement with experiment than\nprevious work. We find a new step bending instability when the driving force is\nalong the step edge direction.

To this end, the\ncorrelations between ejection velocity, binary proportion, mean system mass,\nbinary orbital period and mass ratio are quantified for simulated aggregates.\nThese consist of a few hundred low-mass binary and single stars, and have\nhalf-mass radii in the range 2.5 to 0.08 pc. The primordial binary-star\npopulation has a period distribution similar to that observed in Taurus-Auriga\nfor pre-main sequence binaries. The findings presented here are useful for\ninterpreting correlations between relative locations and proper motions, binary\nproperties and masses of young stellar systems within and surrounding star\nforming regions, and of stellar systems escaping from Galactic clusters.\n(shortened)",

Given such a\nHopf algebra A, consider its coradical filtration and the associated graded\ncoalgebra grad(A). Then grad(A) is a graded Hopf algebra, since the coradical\nA_0 of A is a Hopf subalgebra. In addition, there is a projection \\pi: grad(A)\n\\to A_0; let R be the algebra of coinvariants of \\pi. Then, by a result of\nRadford and Majid, R is a braided Hopf algebra and grad(A) is the bosonization\n(or biproduct) of R and A_0: grad(A) is isomorphic to (R # A_0). The principle\nwe propose to study A is first to study R, then to transfer the information to\ngrad(A) via bosonization, and finally to lift to A. In this article, we apply\nthis principle to the situation when R is the simplest braided Hopf algebra: a\nquantum linear space. As consequences of our technique, we obtain the\nclassification of pointed Hopf algebras of order p^3 (p an odd prime) over an\nalgebraically closed field of characteristic zero; with the same hypothesis,\nthe characterization of the pointed Hopf algebras whose coradical is abelian\nand has index p or p^2; and an infinite family of pointed, non-isomorphic, Hopf\nalgebras of the same dimension.

We find that the 100 micron emission\nextends at least to radii of 27 kpc (2$\\sigma$ detection) for the typical\ngalaxy in the 5 arcmin - 10 arcmin sample and to 21 kpc (2$\\sigma$ detection)\nin the 10 arcmin - 30 arcmin sample (H$_{0} = $75 km/s/Mpc). In both samples,\nthe emission is preferentially elongated along the optical major axis. We fit\nan exponential to the 100 micron emission along the major axis and measure a\nscale length of $2.5 \\pm$ 0.8 kpc (90% confidence interval). Using a simple\nmodel that relates the far-IR emission to the stellar distribution, we examine\nthe range of acceptable dust mass distributions allowed by our data and\nconclude that the dust is more extended than the starlight.",

The algorithm is directly implemented in x-space\nby a Laguerre expansion of the parton distributions. All the leading-twist\ndistributions are evolved: longitudinally polarized, transversely polarized and\nunpolarized, to NLO accuracy. The expansion is optimal at finite x, up to\nreasonably small x-values ($x\\approx 10^{-3}$), below which the convergence of\nthe expansion slows down. The polarized evolution is smoother, due to the less\nsingular structure of the anomalous dimensions at small-x. In the region of\nfast convergence, which covers most of the usual perturbative applications,\nhigh numerical accuracy is achieved by expanding over a set of approximately 30\npolynomials, with a very modest running time.",

The\nrelations with the mid-infrared luminosities are more sensitive to different\npopulations of galaxies, while a single relation of the 12-25 micron color vs.\nthe ratio of the far-infrared and the blue luminosities applies equally well to\nthese different populations. The luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies\nhave redder 12-25 micron colors than those of the quasars. These relations\nprovide powerful tools to differentiate different populations of galaxies. We\nhave also selected a sample of 668 galaxies from the IRAS Faint Source Survey\nflux-density limited at 200 mJy at 12 microns. A 12 micron local luminosity\nfunction is derived and, for the first time in the literature, effects of\ndensity variation in the local universe are considered and corrected in the\ncalculation of the 12 micron luminosity function. It is also found that the 12\nmicron-selected sample are dominated by quasars and active galaxies, which\ntherefore strongly affect the 12 micron luminosity function at high\nluminosities. The ultraluminous infrared galaxies are relatively rare at 12\nmicron comparing with a 25 micron sample.",
