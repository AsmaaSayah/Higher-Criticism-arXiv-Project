    "summary": "The DNA promoter sequences domain theory and database have become popular for\ntesting systems that integrate empirical and analytical learning. This note\nreports a simple change and reinterpretation of the domain theory in terms of\nM-of-N concepts, involving no learning, that results in an accuracy of 93.4% on\nthe 106 items of the database. Moreover, an exhaustive search of the space of\nM-of-N domain theory interpretations indicates that the expected accuracy of a\nrandomly chosen interpretation is 76.5%, and that a maximum accuracy of 97.2%\nis achieved in 12 cases. This demonstrates the informativeness of the domain\ntheory, without the complications of understanding the interactions between\nvarious learning algorithms and the theory. In addition, our results help\ncharacterize the difficulty of learning using the DNA promoters theory.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces ICET, a new algorithm for cost-sensitive\nclassification. ICET uses a genetic algorithm to evolve a population of biases\nfor a decision tree induction algorithm. The fitness function of the genetic\nalgorithm is the average cost of classification when using the decision tree,\nincluding both the costs of tests (features, measurements) and the costs of\nclassification errors. ICET is compared here with three other algorithms for\ncost-sensitive classification - EG2, CS-ID3, and IDX - and also with C4.5,\nwhich classifies without regard to cost. The five algorithms are evaluated\nempirically on five real-world medical datasets. Three sets of experiments are\nperformed. The first set examines the baseline performance of the five\nalgorithms on the five datasets and establishes that ICET performs\nsignificantly better than its competitors. The second set tests the robustness\nof ICET under a variety of conditions and shows that ICET maintains its\nadvantage. The third set looks at ICET's search in bias space and discovers a\nway to improve the search.",

The low energy expansion of the\nblack hole entropy is studied in a non-equilibrium situation: the semiclassical\ndecay of hot flat space by black hole nucleation. In this context the entropy\ncan be defined as an enhancement factor in the semiclassical decay rate, which\nis dominated by a sphaleron-like saddle point. We find that all perturbative\ndivergences appearing in Euclidean calculations of the entropy can be\nrenormalized in low energy couplings. We also discuss some formal aspects of\nthe relation between the Euclidean and Hamiltonian approaches to the one loop\ncorrections to black hole entropy and geometric entropy, and we emphasize the\nvirtues of the use of covariant regularization prescriptions. In fact, the\ndefinition of black hole entropy in terms of decay rates {\\it requires} the use\nof covariant measures and accordingly, covariant regularizations in path\nintegrals. Finally, we speculate on the possibility that low energy effective\nfield theory could be sufficient to understand the microscopic degrees of\nfreedom underlying black hole entropy. We propose a qualitative physical\npicture in which black hole entropy refers to a space of quasi-coherent states\nof infalling matter, together with its gravitational field. We stress that this\nscenario might provide a low energy explanation of both the black hole entropy\nand the information puzzle.",

The\neffects of varying the ratio of the dark matter halo size to the distance of\nclosest approach were explored. Once the dark matter halos are fully\noverlapping, the more massive simulated galaxies achieve a larger maximum\nseparation after the first encounter despite the increased dynamical friction\ncaused by the more extended halos. Projected separation and radial velocity\nhistograms were generated by \"observing\" the simulation results at various\ntimes and from various orientations. These histograms were compared with\nobservations of galaxy pairs (Charlton & Salpeter 1991; Chengalur, Salpeter, &\nTerzian 1993) with the result that large halo radii (~200 - 600 kpc) and wide\ndistances of closest approach are generally favored. It is difficult to\nreconcile the small radial velocity differences that have been observed (median\nof ~ 30 km/s, Chengalur et al. 1993) with the simulations when we sample all\nparts of the orbits equally. Including an additional population of wide pairs\nthat have just recently reached \"turnabout\" from the Hubble flow would lower\nthe median velocity differences. Models suggest that additional data for pairs\nat intermediate separations should have a somewhat larger median velocity\ndifference than the wide pairs.

In particular, confinement can be\naccommodated, but it is not explained. At short distances there is no\nindication of a linear term in the potential.",

First of all, we start by reviewing a previous work where a\nstring theory is used as describing the dynamics of the event horizon of a four\ndimensional black hole. Then we consider a particle model defined on one\ndimensional Euclidean line in a three dimensional black hole as a target\nspacetime metric. By solving the field equations we find a ``world line\ninstanton'' which connects the past event horizon with the future one. This\nsolution gives us the exact value of the Hawking temperature and to leading\norder the Bekenstein-Hawking formula of black hole entropy. We also show that\nthis formalism is extensible to an arbitrary spacetime dimension. Finally we\nmake a comment of one-loop quantum correction to the black hole entropy .",

    "summary": "The slope of the Isgur-Wise function at the normalization point,\n$\\xi^{(1)}(1)$,is one of the basic parameters for the extraction of the $CKM$\nmatrix element $V_{cb}$ from exclusive semileptonic decay data. A method for\nmeasuring this parameter on the lattice is the effective theory for heavy\nquarks at small velocity $v$. This theory is a variant of the heavy quark\neffective theory in which the motion of the quark is treated as a perturbation.\nIn this work we study the lattice renormalization of the slow heavy quark\neffective theory. We show that the renormalization of $\\xi^{(1)}(1)$ is not\naffected by ultraviolet power divergences, implying no need of difficult\nnon-perturbative subtractions. A lattice computation of $\\xi^{(1)}(1)$ with\nthis method is therefore feasible in principle. The one-loop renormalization\nconstants of the effective theory for slow heavy quarks are computed to order\n$v^2$ together with the lattice-continuum renormalization constant of\n$\\xi^{(1)}(1)$ . We demonstrate that the expansion in the heavy-quark velocity\nreproduces correctly the infrared structure of the original (non-expanded)\ntheory to every order. We compute also the one-loop renormalization constants\nof the slow heavy quark effective theory to higher orders in $v^2$ and the\nlattice-continuum renormalization constants of the higher derivatives of the\n$\\xi$ function. Unfortunately, the renormalization constants of the higher\nderivatives are affected by ultraviolet power divergences, implying the\nnecessity of numerical non-perturbative subtractions. The lattice computation\nof higher derivatives of the Isgur-Wise function seems therefore problematic.",

Especially, we remark the\neffects of flavor changing neutral current on the unitary triangle of\nCabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix.

We then introduce a matrix model which reproduces the sum over\nholomorphic maps from arbitrary Riemann surfaces onto $CP^1$. We compute\nintersection numbers on the moduli space of curves using geometrical method and\nshow that the results agree with those predicted by the matrix model. We also\ndevelop a Landau-Ginzburg (LG) description of the $CP^1$ model using a\nsuperpotential $e^X+e^{t_{0,Q}}e^{-X}$ given by the Lax operator of the Toda\nhierarchy ($X$ is the LG field and $t_{0,Q}$ is the coupling constant of the\nK\\\"ahler class). The form of the superpotential indicates the close connection\nbetween $CP^1$ and $N=2$ supersymmetric sine-Gordon theory which was noted some\ntime ago by several authors.

It is found that $\\chi_2$ ranges from $-0.36$ to $-0.60$ in the decays\nfrom $D\\to\\bar{K}\\pi$ to $D^+\\to\\phi\\pi^+,~D\\to\\bar{K}^*\\pi$, while it is of\norder 10\\% with a positive sign in $B\\to\\psi K,~D\\pi,~D^*\\pi,~D\\rho$ decays.\nTherefore, the effective parameter $a_2$ is process dependent in charm decay,\nwhereas it stays fairly stable in $B$ decay. This implies the picture that\nnonfactorizable effects become stronger when the decay particles become less\nenergetic after hadronization. As for $D,\\,B\\to VV$ decays, the presence of\nnonfactorizable terms in general prevents a possible definition of effective\n$a_1$ and $a_2$. This is reenforced by the observation of a large longitudinal\npolarization fraction in $B\\to\\psi K^*$ decay, implying $S$-wave dominated\nnonfactorizable effects. The nonfactorizable term dominated by the $S$-wave is\nalso essential for understanding the decay rate of $B^-\\to D^{*0} \\rho^-$. It\nis found that all nonfactorizable effects $A_1^{nf}/A_1^{BK^*},~A\n_1^{nf}/A_1^{B\\rho},~A_1^{nf}/A_1^{BD^*}$ ($nf$ standing for nonfactorization)\nare positive and of order 10\\%, in accordance with $\\chi_2(B\\to D(D^*)\\pi(\n\\rho))$ and $\\chi_2(B\\to\\psi K)$. However, we show that in $D\\to\\bar{K}^*\\rho$\ndecay nonfactorizable effects cannot be dominated by the $S$-wave. A\npolarization measurement in the color- and Cabibbo-suppressed decay mode\n$D^+\\to\\phi\\rho^+$ is strongly urged in order to test if $A_2^{nf}/A_2$ plays a\nmore pivotal role than $A_1^{nf}/A_1$ in charm decay.",

Only by adopting\nentirely novel technologies that allow one to build large and inexpensive\ntelescopes can we achieve truly large improvements.

I argue\nthat forthcoming technological improvements will make Liquid Mirror Telescopes\n(LMTs) nearly as versatile as conventional telescopes. I address the issue of\nthe fields accessible to LMTs equipped with novel optical correctors. Optical\ndesign work and exploratory laboratory work indicate that a single LMT should\nbe able to access, with excellent images, subregions anywhere inside fields as\nlarge as 45 degrees.\n  As a practical example of what an LMT can do with the present technology, I\nexamine the expected performance of a 5-m liquid mirror telescope, presently\nunder construction, dedicated to a cosmological survey.

The observations and data analysis have been described in\na companion paper (Santos-Lle\\'o et al. 1994; Paper~1). The active nucleus in\nthis galaxy is strongly and rapidly variable in all wavebands, implying that\nthe continuum source is unusually compact. Its energy distribution from\n1.2~$\\mu$m to 1200~\\AA\\/ obeys a power-law whose index is significantly steeper\nthan is usual in Seyfert's or QSO's; the ``big bump'' is either absent or\nshifted to wavelengths shorter than 1200~\\AA\\/. The variations of the\nsoft-X~ray {\\em excess\\/} do not correlate with those of the UV or hard X-ray\ncontinuum. The far UV and optical fluxes are well correlated, while the\ncorrelation between the hard X-rays and 1447 \\AA\\ continuum is only marginally\nsignificant. Moreover, the optical flux cannot lag behind the UV by more than 6\ndays. These results cannot be accommodated in the framework of the standard\ngeometrically thin accretion disk model. Rather, they suggest that the bulk of\nthe UV and optical flux originates from thermal reprocessing of X-rays\nirradiating the disk. The soft X-ray excess is probably the only spectral\ncomponent which originates from viscous dissipation inside the disk and the\nnear infrared is probably emitted by hot dust heated by the UV radiation. Such\na model is consistent with NGC~4593 having a relatively small black-hole mass\nof the order of $2\\times10^{6}{\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ as inferred from the line\nvariability study. The high ionization/excitation emission lines are very broad\nand strongly variable and their variations correlate with those of the\ncontinuum. The low excitation lines are significantly narrower and remain\nconstant within the accuracy of our measurements. These results suggest a\nstratified BLR, where the degree of ionization and the velocity dispersion of\nthe gas increase toward small radii. The \\lya\\ line responds to the variations\nof the continuum with a delay $\\leq 4$ days. To a first order approximation,\nthe BLR in NGC~4593 is well modelled with two different zones at distances of\n$\\sim$~15 and 3 lt-ds from the ionizing source respectively.",

However, for $-3<n<-1$ the existence of self-similar scaling has not\nbeen adequately demonstrated. Here we investigate the possible breaking of\nself-similar scaling due to the nonlinear contributions of long wave modes. For\n$n<-1$ the nonlinear terms in the Fourier space fluid equations contain terms\nthat diverge due to contributions from wavenumber $k\\to 0$ (the long wave\nlimit). To assess the possible dynamical effects of this divergence the limit\nof long wave contributions is investigated in detail using two different\nanalytical approaches.\n  Perturbative contributions to the power spectrum are examined. It is shown\nthat for $n<-1$ there are divergent contributions at all orders. However, at\nevery order the leading order divergent terms cancel out exactly. This does not\nrule out the existence of a weaker but nevertheless divergent net contribution.\nThe second approach consists of a non-perturbative approximation, developed to\nstudy the nonlinear effects of long wave mode coupling. A solution for the\nphase shift of the Fourier space density is obtained which is divergent for\n$n<-1$. A kinematical interpretation of the divergence of the phase shift,\nrelated to the translational motion induced by the large-scale bulk velocity,\nis given. Our analysis indicates that the amplitude of the density is {\\it not}\naffected by the divergent terms. Thus both analytical approaches lead to the\nconclusion that the self-similar scaling of physically relevant measures of the\ngrowth of density perturbations is preserved.",

We examine the influence of Mach\nnumber of the flow and size of the accretor upon the physical behaviour of the\nflow and the accretion rates. The hydrodynamics is modeled by the ``Piecewise\nParabolic Method'' (PPM). The resolution in the vicinity of the accretor is\nincreased by multiply nesting several $32^3$-zone grids around the sphere, each\nfiner grid being a factor of two smaller in zone dimension than the next\ncoarser grid. This allows us to include a coarse model for the surface of the\naccretor (vacuum sphere) on the finest grid while at the same time evolving the\ngas on the coarser grids. For small Mach numbers (0.6 and~1.4) the flow\npatterns tend towards a steady state, while in the case of supersonic flow\n(Mach~3 and~10) and small enough accretors, (radius of~0.1 and~0.02 accretion\nradii) an unstable Mach cone develops, destroying axisymmetry. Our 3D models do\nnot show the highly dynamic flip-flop flow so prominent in 2D calculations\nperformed by other authors. In the gamma=4/3 models, the shock front remains\ncloser to the accretor and the mass accretion rates are higher than in the\ngamma=5/3 models, whereas the rms of the specific angular momentum accreted\ndoes not change.",

It is shown that\nthe Kolmogorov technique corresponds to an infinite resummation of the usual\nperturbative series. The corresponding expansion is convergent for the quantum\nanharmonic oscillator due to the fact that it turns out to be identical to the\nPade series. The method is easily generalizable to many-dimensional cases. The\nKolmogorov technique is further applied to a non-perturbative treatment of\nYang-Mills quantum mechanics. A controllable expansion for the wave function\nnear the origin is constructed. For large fields, we build an asymptotic\nadiabatic expansion in inverse powers of the field.

Langevin dynamic simulations were performed\nfor various Josephson-coupling anisotropies and for various temperatures in\nboth zero and finite magnetic fields. We find that, in the highly anisotropic\nregion, the interlayer coupling, which causes the non-vanishing critical\ncurrent ($I_{c}$), is suppressed by thermal fluctuations, and tends to push up\nthe Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature ($T_{KT}$) of the\ntwo-dimensional (2D) regime. In this highly anisotropic region, $I_c$ begins to\ndecrease drastically near $T_{KT}$. This suggests that interlayer coupling is\nscreened by thermally excited 2D small vortex-antivortex pairs as well as the\nintralayer logarithmic part of vortex-antivortex interactions. Moreover, weak\nmagnetic fields parallel to the $c$-axis affect only the\nlogarithmic-interaction part between the 2D pancake vortices.",

Using\na new numerical approach (based on integration for complex coordinates) to the\nproblem for the stellar exterior we have computed the eigenfrequencies of the\nhighly damped w-modes. The results obtained agree well with recent ones of\nLeins, Nollert and Soffel (1993) Specifically, we are able to explain why\nseveral modes in this regime of the complex frequency plane could not be\nidentified within the WKB approach of Kokkotas and Schutz (1992). Furthermore,\nwe have established that the ``kink'' that was a prominent feature of the\nspectra of Kokkotas and Schutz, but did not appear in the results of Leins {\\em\net al.}, was a numerical artefact. Using our new numerical code we are also\nable to compute, for the first time, several of the slowly damped (p) modes for\nthe considered stellar models. For very compact stars we find, somewhat\nsurprisingly, that the damping of these modes does not decrease monotonically\nas one proceeds to higher oscillation frequencies. The existence of low-order\nmodes that damp away much faster than anticipated may have implications for\nquestions regarding stellar stability and the lifetime of gravitational-wave\nsources. The present results illustrate the accuracy and reliability of the\ncomplex-coordinate method and indicate that the method could prove to be of\ngreat use also in problems involving rotating stars. There is no apparent\nreason why the complex-coordinate approach should not extend to rotating stars,\nwhereas it is accepted that all previous methods will fail to do so.",

We calculate a large number of magnification patterns for positions of\nthe stars slightly offset from one frame to the next, and in this way obtain\nlight curves for fixed quasar and galaxy positions, only due to the change in\nthe relative star positions. These light curves are analyzed to identify micro-\nlensing events, which are classified according to height, duration, and slope.\nWe find that microlensing events produced by random motion of stars are\nshorter, steeper, and more frequent than bulk motion events. This difference is\ncaused by the fact that in the case of random motion, caustics can move with\narbitrarily high velocity, producing very short events. An accompanying video\nillustrates these results. For three different values of the surface mass\ndensity kappa, it shows time sequences of 1000 magnification patterns for\nslowly changing lens positions, together with the positions and velocity\nvectors of the microlensing stars.

    "summary": "In a quantum computer any superposition of inputs evolves unitarily into the\ncorresponding superposition of outputs. It has been recently demonstrated that\nsuch computers can dramatically speed up the task of finding factors of large\nnumbers -- a problem of great practical significance because of its\ncryptographic applications. Instead of the nearly exponential ($\\sim \\exp\nL^{1/3}$, for a number with $L$ digits) time required by the fastest classical\nalgorithm, the quantum algorithm gives factors in a time polynomial in $L$\n($\\sim L^2$). This enormous speed-up is possible in principle because quantum\ncomputation can simultaneously follow all of the paths corresponding to the\ndistinct classical inputs, obtaining the solution as a result of coherent\nquantum interference between the alternatives. Hence, a quantum computer is\nsophisticated interference device, and it is essential for its quantum state to\nremain coherent in the course of the operation. In this report we investigate\nthe effect of decoherence on the quantum factorization algorithm and establish\nan upper bound on a ``quantum factorizable'' $L$ based on the decoherence\nsuffered per operational step.",

In this {\\it Letter} I\npresent the distributions of velocity dispersion, mean separation, and\ndynamical masses of clusters when substructure is eliminated from the cluster\ndatasets. I also discuss the changes in these distributions because of the\nsubstructure correction. Comparing the masses of clusters with central galaxies\nbefore and after correction for the presence of substructure reveals a\nsignificant change. This change is driven by reductions in the mean separation\nof galaxies, not by a decrease in the velocity dispersions as has generally\nbeen assumed. Correction for substructure reduces most significantly the masses\nof systems with cool X-ray temperatures, suggesting that the use of a constant\nlinear radius (1.5$h _{100} ^{-1}$ Mpc in this study) to determine cluster\nmembership is inappropriate for clusters spanning a range of temperatures\nand/or morphologies.",

We then discuss conditions which\nguarantee that such a path minimizes the Hofer length. Our argument relies on a\ngeneral geometric construction (the gluing of monodromies) and on an extension\nof Gromov's non-squeezing theorem both to more general manifolds and to more\ngeneral capacities. The manifolds we consider are quasi-cylinders, that is\nspaces homeomorphic to $M \\times D^2$ which are symplectically ruled over\n$D^2$. When we work with the usual capacity (derived from embedded balls), we\ncan prove the existence of paths which minimize the length among all homotopic\npaths, provided that $M$ is semi-monotone. (This restriction occurs because of\nthe well-known difficulty with the theory of $J$-holomorphic curves in\narbitrary $M$.) However, we can only prove the existence of length-minimizing\npaths (i.e. paths which minimize length amongst {\\it all} paths, not only the\nhomotopic ones) under even more restrictive conditions on $M$, for example when\n$M$ is exact and convex or of dimension $2$. The new difficulty is caused by\nthe possibility that there are non-trivial and very short loops in $\\Ham^c(M)$.\nWhen such length-minimizing paths do exist, we can extend the\nBialy--Polterovich calculation of the Hofer norm on a neighbourhood of the\nidentity ($C^1$-flatness).",

    "summary": "A general description of string excitations in stationary spacetimes is\ndeveloped. If a stationary string passes through the ergosphere of a\n4-dimensional black hole, its world-sheet describes a 2-dimensional black (or\nwhite) hole with horizon coinciding with the static limit of the 4-dimensional\nblack hole. Mathematical results for 2-dimensional black holes can therefore be\napplied to physical objects (say) cosmic strings in the vicinity of Kerr black\nholes. An immediate general result is that the string modes are thermally\nexcited. The string excitations are determined by a coupled system of scalar\nfield equations in the world-sheet metric. In the special case of excitations\npropagating along a stationary string in the equatorial plane of the\nKerr-Newman black hole, they reduce to the $s$-wave scalar field equations in\nthe 4-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m black hole. We briefly discuss\npossible applications of our results to the black hole information puzzle.",

Excellent\nagreement is obtained with recent Monte Carlo calculations, including an\nanomalous volume of the Fermi surface near half-filling, which can possibly be\nexplained in terms of a breakdown of Fermi liquid theory. The calculated bands\nare very flat around the (pi,0) points of the Brillouin zone in agreement with\nphotoemission measurements of cuprate superconductors. With doping there is a\nshift in spectral weight from the upper band to the lower band. The Roth method\nis extended to deal with superconductivity within a four-pole approximation\nallowing electron-hole mixing. It is shown that triplet p-wave pairing never\noccurs. Singlet d_{x^2-y^2}-wave pairing is strongly favoured and optimal\ndoping occurs when the van Hove singularity, corresponding to the flat band\npart, lies at the Fermi level. Nearest neighbour antiferromagnetic correlations\nplay an important role in flattening the bands near the Fermi level and in\nfavouring superconductivity.

We focus here on the effects of finite\n(non-zero) temperatures on the dynamical behaviour of the system.

First, it is\noptimized for multi-processor computers, and will use as many processors as are\navailable. Second, it is optimized for inhomogeneous, dynamic particle\ndistributions; for any distribution the computational load is distributed\nevenly to all processors, and the communication time is less than 15\\% of the\ntotal run time.\n  In this talk we present our new algorithm. We developed the program for a\ngrand-challenge problem in cosmology, simulation of the formation of\nlarge-scale structure in the universe. This simulation, run on the Thinking\nMachines Corporation CM-5, uses the particle-particle/particle-mesh (PPPM)\n\\cite{hock_east} algorithm. The particle-particle phase is computed using the\nalgorithm we describe in this paper. We discuss this and other applications.",

Within this approximation the source size can be estimated\nfrom the maximum magnification reached at caustic crossings. We evaluate the\nlimitations imposed by diffraction on caustics using the formalism developed by\nUlmer & Goodman (1995). Close to a caustic a new characteristic length, smaller\nthat the Fresnel length, enters the problem, limiting the angular resolution to\nabout 0.2 pico arcsecond, or equivalently about 3*10^9 cm at the source. To\nachieve this resolution the brightness must be monitored at time intervals of a\nfew seconds. If a significant fraction of quasar luminosity comes from sources\nsmaller than those limits then interference effects would make the observed\nintensity oscillate, in a close analogy with a two slit experiment. The\ncharacteristic period of such oscillations is expected to be about one tenth of\na minute. If such oscillations are detected then photometry carried out at a\nsingle site may permit the determination of the caustic transverse velocity,\nand therefore may permit a direct conversion of the time units of brightness\nvariations to the linear units at the source.

As a byproduct, a simple\nderivation of the `mass spectrum' for the Klein-Gordon field is presented, but\nit is also shown that there is a complete additional spectrum of negative\n`masses'. Finally, two major reasons are presented against the viability of\nthis alternative proposal: a) It does not lead to the correct energy spectrum\nfor the hydrogen atom. b) For field models, the standard quantum theory cannot\nbe recovered from this alternative description.",

The fields were\nobserved through two broad-band (\\V\\ and \\I) and two narrow-band (\\CN\\ and\n\\TiO) filters. The broad-band data were used to construct \\IvsVI\\\ncolor-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and, in some of our fields, we found\nsignificant numbers of stars in the Cepheid instability strip. A distance\nmodulus for the Cepheids in the middle field was found that agreed well with\nother values in the literature values. The width of the giant branch (GB) in\nthe \\IvsVI\\ CMD of all 5 fields was investigated, and we show that in four of\nthe fields a likely explanation for the GB width is a combination of {\\it both}\nmetallicity and mass variations. Using the broad-band data, the asymptotic\ngiant branch (AGB) luminosity functions (LFs) were measured in the five fields,\nand we show that differences exist between these LFs. We speculate on how the\ndifferent star forming histories in the fields may lead to the observed AGB LFs\nand GB widths. Using the narrow-band data along with the broad-band data we\nseparated the AGB stars into carbon-rich (C) and oxygen-rich (M) types. The\ncarbon stars LFs were used to obtain an estimate for the distance modulus of\nM31 which agrees with the value derived from Cepheids. The ratio of C- to\nM-stars (C/M) is believed to be an indicator of gaseous chemical abundance at\nthe time of formation of these stars. We show that the C/M ratio increases\nsmoothly with galactocentric distance, suggesting an inverse correlation with\nmetallicity. This is the first demonstration of this effect within a single\nextragalactic system. We find that differences in the width of the GB and the\nAGB LFs do not significantly affect the C/M ratio. We consider the effect of\nthe increasing C/M ratio on the ISM in M31, and cite evidence in favor of a\nmodel where the grain composition in M31 is a function of galactocentric\ndistance.",

Because of the relevance of symmetric space models to duality\nsymmetries in string theory, the hidden symmetries of these models are explored\nin some detail. The string theory application requires including coupling to\ngravity, supersymmetrization, and quantum effects. However, as a first step,\nthis paper only considers classical bosonic theories in flat space-time. Even\nthough the algebra of hidden symmetries of principal chiral models is confirmed\nto include a Kac--Moody algebra (or a current algebra on a circle), it is\nargued that a better interpretation is provided by a doubled current algebra on\na semi-circle (or line segment). Neither the circle nor the semi-circle bears\nany apparent relationship to the physical space. For symmetric space models the\nline segment viewpoint is shown to be essential, and special boundary\nconditions need to be imposed at the ends. The algebra of hidden symmetries\nalso includes Virasoro-like generators. For both principal chiral models and\nsymmetric space models, the hidden symmetry stress tensor is singular at the\nends of the line segment.",

However it might suggest a\nsolution if the minimum of the induced potential coincides with the true\nminimum. The induced Hubble scale mass also has important implications for the\nAffleck-Dine mechanism of baryogenesis.

These spectra show strong Balmer absorption\nlines like those observed in A-type stars, as expected if the object is a young\nglobular cluster. The age estimated from the strength of the Balmer lines is\nabout 0.5 Gyr, although ages ranging from 0.1 Gyr to 0.9 Gyr can not be\nconfidently excluded given current models of stellar populations. If these\nestimated ages are adopted for the young cluster population of NGC 1275 as a\nwhole, the fading predicted by stellar populations models gives a luminosity\nfunction which is consistent with that of the Galactic globular cluster system\nconvolved with the observational selection function for the NGC 1275 system. We\nalso use the equivalent widths of the Mg $b$ and Fe 5270 features to constrain\nthe metallicity of the young cluster. Combining these absorption-line widths\nwith the age estimates from the Balmer lines and stellar population models, we\nfind a metallicity of roughly solar based on the Mg $b$ index and somewhat\nhigher for the Fe 5270 index. The radial velocity of the absorption lines of\nthe cluster spectrum is offset from the emission lines of the galaxy spectrum\nat the same position by $-130$ \\kms, providing further evidence for the\nidentification of the object as a globular cluster, and opening up the future\npossibility of studying the kinematics of young cluster systems. The discovery\nof objects with the characteristics of young globular clusters in NGC 1275,\nwhich shows evidence of a recent interaction or merger, supports the hypothesis\nthat galaxy interactions and mergers are favorable sites for the formation of\nglobular clusters.",

For a circular orbit, the modes generally undergo forced\noscillation with a period equal to the orbital period ($T$). For an eccentric\norbit, the amplitude of each tidally excited mode can be written approximately\nas the sum of an oscillatory term that varies sinusoidally with the mode\nfrequency and a `static' term that follows the time dependence of the tidal\nforcing function. The oscillatory term falls off exponentially with increasing\n$\\b$ (defined as the ratio of the periastron passage time to the mode period),\nwhereas the `static' term is independent of $\\b$. For small $\\b$ modes ($\\b\n\\approx 1$), the two terms are comparable, and the magnitude of the mode\namplitude is nearly constant over the orbit. For large $\\b$ modes ($\\b \\gta$ a\nfew), the oscillatory term is very small compared to the `static' term, in\nwhich case the mode amplitude, like the tidal force, varies as the distance\ncubed. For main sequence stars, $p$, $f$, and low order $g$-modes generally\nhave large $\\b$ and hence small amplitudes of oscillation. High overtone\n$g$-modes, however, have small overlap with the tidal forcing function. Thus,\nwe expect an intermediate overtone $g$-mode with $\\b \\sim 1$ to have the\nlargest oscillation amplitude. The dependence on mode damping and the stellar\nrotation rate is considered, as well as the effects of orbital evolution.

    "summary": "The scaling argument developed by Larichev and Held (1995) for eddy\namplitudes and fluxes in a horizontally homogeneous, two-layer model on an\nf-plane is extended to a beta-plane. In terms of the non-dimensional number x =\nU/(beta*lambda^2), where lambda is the deformation radius and U is the mean\nthermal wind, the result for the RMS eddy velocity V, the characteristic\nwavenumber of the energy-containing eddies and of the eddy-driven jets k, and\nthe magnitude of the eddy diffusivity for potential vorticity D, in the limit\nx>>1, are as follows: V/U ~ x ; k*lambda ~ 1/x ; D/(U*lambda) ~ x^2. Numerical\nsimulations provide qualitative support for this scaling, but suggest that it\nunderestimates the sensitivity of these eddy statistics to the value of x. A\ngeneralization that is applicable to continuous stratification is suggested\nwhich leads to the estimates: V ~ 1/(beta T^2); k ~ beta*T; D ~\n1/{[beta^2][T^3]} where T is a time-scale determined by the environment; in\nparticular, it equals lambda/U in the two-layer model and N/(fS) in a\ncontinuous flow with uniform shear S and stratification N. This same scaling\nhas also been suggested as relevant to a continuously stratified fluid in the\nopposite limit, x<<1 (Held, 1980). Therefore, we suggest that it may be of\ngeneral relevance in planetary atmospheres and in the oceans.",

For the case\nof unit magnetic charge, spherically symmetric solutions of this type have\npreviously been studied. For other values of the magnetic charge, general\narguments show that any new solution with hair cannot be spherically symmetric.\nIn this paper we develop and apply a perturbative scheme (which may have\napplicability in other contexts) for constructing such solutions in the case\nwhere the Reissner-Nordstrom solution is just barely unstable. For a few low\nvalues of the magnetic charge the black holes retain a rotational symmetry\nabout a single axis, but this axial symmetry disappears for higher charges.\nWhile the vector meson fields vanish exponentially fast at distances greater\nthan $O(m^{-1})$, the magnetic field and the metric have higher multipole\ncomponents that decrease only as powers of the distance from the black hole.",

Following the same way for the Ashtekar theory it\nwill turn out to be equivalent to two successive canonical transformations\nwhere the first makes explicit use of the spatial dimension being 3 and the\nsecond is usually hidden in the use of densities. At the end we can give a\nsimple version of the reality constraints.",

For the discrete sine-Gordon equation and the Fibonacci and\nThue-Morse chains taken as examples, we have found that the phenomenology of\naperiodic systems is very peculiar: On the one hand, they exhibit soliton\npinning as in the random chain, although the depinning forces are clearly\nsmaller. In addition, solitons are seen to propagate differently in the\naperiodic chains than on periodic chains with large unit cells, given by\napproximations to the full aperiodic sequence. We show that most of these\nphenomena can be understood by means of simple collective coordinate arguments,\nwith the exception of long range order effects. In the conclusion we comment on\nthe interesting implications that our work could bring about in the field of\nsolitons in molecular (e.g., DNA) chains.",

It is\nwell-known that quantum coherence can obliterate many chaotic behavior in the\ncorresponding classical system. But interaction with an environment can under\ngeneral circumstances quickly diminish quantum coherence and reenact many\nclassical chaotic behavior. How effective decoherence works to sustain chaos,\nand how the resultant behavior qualitatively differs from the quantum picture\ndepend on the coupling of the system with the environment and the spectral\ndensity and temperature of the environment.

We\ndemonstrate that all such divergences may be eliminated by introducing\nradiative corrections to the leading-order scattering amplitudes. These\ncorrections impose a choice of basis states that must be used in scattering\ncalculations: electron states must diagonalize the mass operator, while photon\nstates must diagonalize the polarization operator. The radiative corrections\nintroduce natural line-widths into the energy denominators of all propagators,\nas well as into the time-development exponentials of all scattering states\ncorresponding to external lines. Since initial and final scattering states may\nnow decay, it is logically necessary to compute scattering amplitudes for a\nfinite time-lapse between the preparation of the initial state and the\nmeasurement of the final state. Strict energy conservation, which appeared in\nprevious formulations of the theory, must thus be abandoned. We exhibit the\ngeneric formulae for the scattering cross-sections in two useful limits,\ncorresponding to the cases where either the initial states or the final states\nare stable, and discuss the application of the general formula when neither of\nthese limits applies.",

The numerical resolution that has recently been\nattained is such that mass-loss from two-body relaxation is negligible.

Singular isothermal halos will\nalways survive at some level, however, if halos form with large core radii then\nthe over-merging problem will always exist within dissipationless N-body\nsimulations.

An alternative approach has been to\nsearch for continuous wave (CW) gravitational radiation from the Crab pulsar.\nIn this paper, we examine the possibility of detecting CW gravitational\nradiation from pulsars and show that nearby millisecond pulsars are generally\nmuch better candidates. We show that the minimum strain h_c ~ 10E-26 that can\nbe detected by tuning an antenna to the frequency of the milli- second pulsar\nPSR 1957+20, with presently available detector technology, is orders of\nmagnitude better than what has been accomplished so far by observing the Crab\npulsar, and within an order of magnitude of the maximum strain that may be\nproduced by it. In addition, we point out that there is likely to be a\npopulation of rapidly rotating neutron stars (not necessarily radio pulsars) in\nthe solar neighborhood whose spindown evolution is driven by gravitational\nradiation. We argue that the projected sensitivity of modern resonant detectors\nis sufficient to detect the subset of this population that lies within 0.1 kpc\nof the sun.",

We apply this fact to constrain topological\ndefect models of highest energy cosmic ray (HECR) production. Such models have\nbeen proposed as possible sources of ultrahigh energy particles and gamma-rays\nwith energies above $10^{20}$eV. The constraints on these models derived from\n$^4$He-photodisintegration are compared to corresponding limits from spectral\ndistortions of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) and from the\nobserved diffuse gamma-ray background. It is shown that for reasonable primary\nparticle injection spectra superconducting cosmic strings, unlike ordinary\nstrings or annihilating monopoles, cannot produce the HECR flux at the present\nepoch without violating at least the $^4$He-photodisintegration bound. The\nconstraint from the diffuse gamma-ray background rules out the dominant\nproduction of HECR by the decay of Grand Unification particles in models with\ncosmological evolution assuming standard fragmentation functions.

The best model we have\nfound succeeded in reproducing the Magellanic Stream (MS), as well as a leading\ncounterpart to the Magellanic Stream (the leading arm), on the opposite side of\nthe Magellanic Clouds to the Stream, which mimicks the overall distribution of\nseveral neutral hydrogen clumps observed in the corresponding region of the\nsky. The elongation of the SMC bar along the line-of-sight direction suggested\nby Cepheid observations has been partially reproduced, alongside its projected\nappearance on the sky. The model successfully explains some major trends in the\nkinematics of young populations in the SMC bar and older populations in the\n`halo' of the SMC, as well as the overall velocity pattern for the gas, young\nstars, and carbon stars in the inter-Cloud region.",

This model is interesting in its own right for possible new applications,\nas well as to help understand the combined effect of spatial correlations and\nnonlinearity on disordered systems. Although we specifically discuss the\napplication of the model to electron transport in semiconductor devices, our\nresults apply to other contexts, such as nonlinear optical phenomena. Our model\nconsists of finite width barriers and nonlinearities are dealt with separately\nin the barriers and in the well, both with and without applied electric fields.\nWe study a wide range of nonlinearity coupling values. When the nonlinear term\nis only present in the barriers, a sideband is observed in addition to the main\nresonance and, as a consequence, the current-voltage characteristics present\ntwo peaks at different voltages. In this case, the phenomenology remains\nbasically the same through all the considered variation of the parameters. When\nthe well is the component exhibiting nonlinearity, the results depend strongly\non the nonlinear coefficient. For small values, the current-voltage\ncharacteristics exhibit lower and upper voltage cutoffs. This phenomenon is not\npresent at higher nonlinearities, and eventually linear-like behavior is\nrecovered. We complete this exhaustive study with an analysis of the effects of\nhaving simultaneously both kinds of nonlinear couplings. We conclude the paper\nwith a summary of our results, their technological implications, and a\nprospective discussion of the consequences of our work for more complex\nsystems.",

The population of faint blue galaxies is at sufficiently\nhigh redshift so that their images are distorted near foreground clusters, with\ngiant luminous arcs being the most spectacular evidence for this effect. Much\nweaker distortions, however, can observationally be detected by a statistical\nanalysis of the numerous faint galaxy images, as first demonstrated by Tyson,\nValdes \\& Wenk. This distortion effect can be used as a {\\it quantitativetool}\nfor the reconstruction of the surface mass density of galaxy clusters with\nappropriate redshifts, as was demonstrated by Kaiser \\&Squires. They have\nderived an explicit equation for this surface mass density in terms of its\ntidal field. The reconstruction formula by Kaiser \\& Squires must be modified\nbecause of two effects: in its original form it applies only to weak lenses,\nand hence must be generalized to account for stronger lensing effects. Second,\ndue to the nature of the inversion formula, it produces boundary artefacts (or\nbiases) if applied to real data which are confined to a finite field on the\nsky. We discuss several possibilities to obtain inversion formulae which are\nexact for ideal data on a finite data field (CCD). We demonstrate that there\nexists an infinite number of such finite-field inversion formulae, which differ\nin their sensitivity to observational effects (such as noise, intrinsic\nellipticities of the sources, etc.). We show that, using two simple conditions,\none can uniquely specify a finite-field formula which in a well-defined sense\nminimizes the sensitivity to observational effects.

These results imply that either there is no evolutionary relation\nbetween these two stars, or that there is an unknown mass loss mechanism. To\ninvestigate possible evolutionary links between these objects, we computed\nevolutionary sequences of white dwarf models including time-dependent\ndiffusion. Our initial model is based on the PG~1159 pulsational data, and has\na surface composition of 30% helium, 35% carbon, and 35% oxygen. Below this is\na thin transition zone where the helium fraction falls to zero. As expected,\ndiffusion caused a separation of the elements; a thickening surface layer of\nnearly pure helium overlays a deepening transition zone where the composition\nreturns to the original surface composition. When the model reached the\ntemperature range of GD~358 and the pulsating DB white dwarfs, this pure helium\nsurface layer was 3x10^-6 stellar masses deep. The resulting evolved model is\nvery similar to the model used by Bradley and Winget (1994) to match the\npulsation observations of GD 358. The pulsation periods of this model also show\na good fit to the WET observations. These results demonstrate the plausibility\nof a direct evolutionary path from PG 1159 stars to the much cooler DB white\ndwarfs by inclusion of time-dependent diffusion. A problem still remains in\nthat our models have no hydrogen, and thus must retain their DB nature while\ntheir surface tempeture drops from 45,000K to 30,000K. Since there are no known\nDB stars in this range, we plan to address this problem in future calculations.",

    "summary": "The entropy of stationary black holes has recently been calculated by a\nnumber of different approaches. Here we compare the Noether charge approach\n(defined for any diffeomorphism invariant Lagrangian theory) with various\nEuclidean methods, specifically, (i) the microcanonical ensemble approach of\nBrown and York, (ii) the closely related approach of Ba\\~nados, Teitelboim, and\nZanelli which ultimately expresses black hole entropy in terms of the Hilbert\naction surface term, (iii) another formula of Ba\\~nados, Teitelboim and Zanelli\n(also used by Susskind and Uglum) which views black hole entropy as conjugate\nto a conical deficit angle, and (iv) the pair creation approach of Garfinkle,\nGiddings, and Strominger. All of these approaches have a more restrictive\ndomain of applicability than the Noether charge approach. Specifically,\napproaches (i) and (ii) appear to be restricted to a class of theories\nsatisfying certain properties listed in section 2; approach (iii) appears to\nrequire the Lagrangian density to be linear in the curvature; and approach (iv)\nrequires the existence of suitable instanton solutions. However, we show that\nwithin their domains of applicability, all of these approaches yield results in\nagreement with the Noether charge approach. In the course of our analysis, we\ngeneralize the definition of Brown and York's quasilocal energy to a much more\ngeneral class of diffeomorphism invariant, Lagrangian theories of gravity. In\nan appendix, we show that in an arbitrary diffeomorphism invariant theory of\ngravity, the ``volume term\" in the ``off-shell\" Hamiltonian associated with a\ntime evolution vector field $t^a$ always can be expressed as the spatial\nintegral of $t^a {\\cal C}_a$, where ${\\cal C}_a = 0$ are the constraints\nassociated with the diffeomorphism invariance.",

The recent unprecedented\nmeasurement of the rotation curve of maser emission sources at the center of\nNGC 4258, and the remarkable discovery that it is Keplerian to high precision,\nprovides us a unique opportunity for testing alternatives to a BH (e.g., a\nmassive cluster of stellar remnants, brown dwarfs, low-mass stars, or halo dark\nmatter).\n  We use a conservative upper limit on the systematic deviation from a\nKeplerian rotation curve to constrain the mass distribution at the galaxy\ncenter. Based on evaporation and physical collision time-scale arguments, we\nshow that a central cluster is ruled out, *unless* the cluster consists of\n*extremely* dense objects with mass less than about 0.05 solar masses (e.g.,\nlow mass BHs or elementary particles). Since both of these dynamically-allowed\nsystems are very improbable for other astrophysical reasons, we conclude that a\ncentral dense cluster at the center of NGC 4258 is *very* improbable, thus\nleaving the alternative possibility of a massive BH. We also show that the mass\nof the BH must be at least 98% of the mass enclosed within the inner edge of\nthe masering disk (3.6*10^7 solar masses).

    "summary": "The impact of chiral symmetry on nuclear physics is discussed in the context\nof recent advances in the few-nucleon systems and of dimensional power\ncounting. The tractability of few-nucleon calculations, illustrated by very\nrecent solutions for $A = 2-6$, is shown to follow from power counting based on\nchiral Lagrangians. The latter predicts the suppression of $N$-body forces, as\noriginally shown by Weinberg. Isospin violation in the nuclear force is\nsimilarly analyzed using the results of van Kolck, and this is shown to be\nconsistent with results from the Nijmegen phase-shift analysis. Conventional\n$\\rho - \\omega$ and $\\pi - \\eta$ mixing models with on-shell mixing strength\nare not inconsistent with naive power counting. Meson-exchange currents\ncalculated in chiral perturbation theory are in good agreement with experiment.",

The strategy in the argument\nis to show that the effective space-time superpotential must vanish because\nthere is no place where it can have a pole. This conclusion comes from either\nof two different analyses, in which the Kahler class or the complex structure\nof the gauge bundle is varied, while keeping everything else fixed. In the\nformer case, we recover from the linear sigma model the usual simple pole in\nthe ${\\bf \\bar {27}}^3$ Yukawa coupling but show that an analogous pole does\nnot arise in the couplings of gauge singlet modes.

A specific feature of the reconstructed\npion \\wf is a quasi--zone character of the $q\\bar q$--excitations. On the basis\nof the obtained pion \\wf and the data on deep inelastic scattering off the\npion, the valence quark distribution in a constituent quark is determined.",

Using resonant photoemission we study how this\nchemical substitution affects the electronic structure of the material. For the\npartial Cu-density of states at E_F and in the region of the valence band we\nobserve no significant difference between a pure superconducting sample and an\ninsulating sample with 60% Pr for Ca. This suggests that the states responsible\nfor superconductivity are predomi- nately O-states. The partial Pr-4f density\nof states was extracted utilizing the Super- Koster-Kronig Pr 4d-4f resonance.\nIt consists of a single peak at 1.36eV binding energy. The peak shows a\nstrongly assymetric Doniach-Sunjic line- shape indicating the presence of a\ncontinuum of electronic states with sharp cut off at E_F even in this\ninsulating sample. This finding excludes a bandgap in the insulating sample and\nsupports the existance of a mobility gap caused by spatial localization of the\ncarriers. The presence of such carriers at the Pr-site, between the CuO_2\nplanes shows that the electronic structure is not purely 2-dimensional but that\nthere is a finite interlayer coupling. The resonance enhancement of the\nphotoemission cross section, at the Pr-4d threshold, was studied for the Pr-4f\nand for Cu-states. Both the Pr-4f and the Cu-states show a Fano-like resonance.\nThis resonance of Cu-states with Pr-states is another indication of coupling\nbetween the the Pr-states and those in the CuO_2 plane. Because of the\nstatistical distribution of the Pr-ions this coupling leads to a non-periodic\npotential for the states in the CuO_2 plane which can lead to localization and\nthus to the observed metal-insulator transition.",

As a test case, we present evolutions for the first 3D black\nhole spacetimes. We identify a number of difficulties in evolving 3D black\nholes and suggest approaches to overcome them. We show how special treatment of\nthe conformal factor can lead to more accurate evolution, and discuss\ntechniques we developed to handle black hole spacetimes in the absence of\nsymmetries. Many different slicing conditions are tested, including geodesic,\nmaximal, and various algebraic conditions on the lapse. With current\nresolutions, limited by computer memory sizes, we show that with certain lapse\nconditions we can evolve the black hole to about $t=50M$, where $M$ is the\nblack hole mass. Comparisons are made with results obtained by evolving\nspherical initial black hole data sets with a 1D spherically symmetric code. We\nalso demonstrate that an ``apparent horizon locking shift'' can be used to\nprevent the development of large gradients in the metric functions that result\nfrom singularity avoiding time slicings.

In the metallic regime\nit is shown that the static charge-transfer and density-density correlation\nfunctions diverge as a function of $V$, indicating a charge-tansfer instability\nand phase separation. This is accompanied by a softening of the $q \\to 0$ mode\nof the dynamic correlation functions which is associated with the excitonic\nexcitations responsible for the superconducting correlations observed in the\nproximity of the phase separation boundary of ref. \\cite{cv95b}.",

This state is viewed as two $|{\\bar\nb}q\\rangle $ particles bound by a potential due to the exchange of the four\nlight pseudoscalar and vector mesons, namely the $\\pi,\\ \\eta,\\ \\rho$ and\n$\\omega$. Couplings of these particles are obtained by the use of heavy quark\nsymmetry. We find that the $I=0,\\ J=1$ state is bound for a large range of\nparameters, while all other states are not bound (the $I=1,\\ J=0$ system may be\nbound for some parameters at the extreme range of their allowed values). We\ndiscuss the reasons why the techniques used cannot be extended to mesons\ncontaining two $c$ quarks or a $c$ and $b$ quark.",

Cooling and\nheating timescales in the ISM are typically shorter than typical galactic\nrotation timescales, so the individual phases in the ISM can be assumed to be\nin temperature equilibrium with the radiation field. Using this approximation\nwe can construct an equation of state which depends upon the average density\nand mass fractions in the individual phases. Previous studies suggest that\nthere is an equilibrium phase fraction as a function of pressure. We\nincorporate evolution towards this equilibrium state as a relaxation term with\na time to obtain equilibrium $\\tau$. We derive a condition in terms of a\ncritical Mach number when one dimensional shocks should be continuous. For\nsmall values of the relaxation time $\\tau$ we show that the relaxation term\nacts like a viscosity. We show with one dimensional simulations that increasing\n$\\tau$ causes shocks to become smoother. This work suggests that phase changes\ncan strongly effect the gas dynamics of the ISM across spiral arms and bars.",

Evidence of vacuum screening of adjoint quarks is obtained from a\ncomparison of quark-antiquark ($Q \\bar Q$) flux-tubes for quarks in the adjoint\n(``isospin'' $j=1$) and fundamental ($j=1/2$) representations. The component\n${\\cal E}_j$ of the color-electric field strength in the direction parallel to\nthe $Q \\bar Q$ axis is calculated. Near the quarks the ratio of fields ${\\cal\nE}_{j=1} / {\\cal E}_{j=1/2}$ approaches the value 8/3, which is equal to the\nratio of SU(2) Casimirs. In between the quarks, the ratio falls well below 8/3\nat large $R$. ${\\cal E}_j$ also falls off rapidly as a function of distance\n$x_\\perp$ perpendicular to the $Q \\bar Q$ axis. However, the ratio ${\\cal\nE}_{j=1} / {\\cal E}_{j=1/2}$ depends very weakly on $x_\\perp$. The flux-tubes\nin the two representations thus appear to have very similar cross-sections.\nThis result could imply that the QCD vacuum is dual to a type I superconductor.",

Although our HST observations include both pre- and\npost-refurbishment images, the depth of the exposures guarantees that the\nmajority of the arcs are detected with diffraction-limited resolution. A number\nof the objects in our sample are multiply-imaged and we illustrate the ease of\nidentification of such features when working at high resolution. We discuss the\nmorphological and scale information on these distant field galaxies in the\nlight of HST studies of lower redshift samples. We conclude that the dominant\npopulation of star-forming galaxies at z=1 is a factor of 1.5-2 times smaller\nthan the similar group in the local field.

    "summary": "Three new photometric CCD-based datasets are presented for NGC~6791. They\nconsist of deep UBV photometry (to $V_{lim} =24$, $B_{lim}=24$, $U_{lim} = 23$)\nof the central parts of the cluster and of selected fields around it, and of\nrelatively shallower UBVI photometry for the whole cluster ($23' \\times 23'$).\nThe data have been used to discuss the reddening, metallicity and age\nofNGC~6791, a cluster which is particularly important because of (1)~its\nmost-advanced age among open clusters, (2)~metallicity higher than solar and\n(3)~particularly large number of member stars. We discovered two new very blue\nstars increasing the total of sdB objects in the cluster to ten. They are\nlocated in a very narrow range magnitudes $V=17.7 \\pm 0.5$; their blue colors\nstrongly constrain our determination of the reddening of the cluster to\n$E(B-V)=0.17 \\pm 0.01$. We detected no other blue stars except a population of\nfaint objects with $V \\approx 22$ in the center of the cluster. We have used\nthe new theoretical isochrones in a differential determination of metallicity\nand age of NGC~6791 using M67 and NGC~188 as two clusters with well-known\nabundaces and age. We find $[Fe/H] \\simeq +0.5$ and age by 1~Gyr older than\nthat of NGC~188. The luminosity function of the cluster is surpisingly flat\nwhile the ``secondary'' main-sequence of equal-mass binaries is weaker than in\nless-populous old open clusters. We explain both features by the large total\nmass of the cluster which has lead to weak evaporation of low-mass and single\nstars from the cluster.",

    "summary": "We present $B,V,R,J,H,K$ broad--band images of the barred galaxy NGC 1097.\nThe optical and infrared colors maps trace the location of the major dust\nfeatures. The dust lanes are relatively free of star formation and have low\nopacity. The depth of the dust lanes decreases as a function of wavelength so\nthat they are deepest at $B$ and shallower at $H$ and $K$ where they are\ndifficult to detect. We find that the dust lane on the north-west side of the\ngalaxy has colors consistent with those of a dust screen with opacity derived\nfrom the galactic extinction law. Thus, it must be located on the near side of\nthe galaxy. The colors in the dust lane on the south-east side of the galaxy,\non the other hand, suggest that there are stars both in front of and behind the\ndust, consistent with this dust lane being located on the far side of the\ngalaxy. Near the inner spiral ring (at $\\sim 17'' = 1.4$kpc from the nucleus),\nthe dust lane becomes double peaked with peak to valley extinction ratio\nsimilar to that observed in radio continuum by Ondrechen and van der Hulst\n(1983). This suggests that if the cold diffuse component of the interstellar\nmedium (traced by the dust) moves with the cosmic ray electron component then\nthe magnetic field pressure is not a significant force in the shocks.\nAlternatively if the two phases do not move together a more detailed comparison\nmay show differences in the shock shapes. From the $K$ images, we estimate that\nthe total stellar mass of the star forming spiral ring at a radius of $\\sim$\n1kpc from the nucleus is of the same order as the molecular gas mass in the\nring. The infrared images show a short bar inside the inner spiral ring. In the\nprincipal plane of the galaxy, the short bar is not perpendicular to the\nprominent outer bar. This suggests that there are torques between the inner bar\nand the spiral",

A generalisation of the abelian Hodge\nstar duality is found which, though not yet known to give dual symmetry,\nreproduces analogues to many dual properties of the abelian theory. For\nexample, there is a dual potential, but it is a 2-indexed tensor $T_{\\mu\\nu}$\nof the Freedman-Townsend type. Though not itself functioning as such,\n$T_{\\mu\\nu}$ gives rise to a dual parallel transport, $\\tilde{A}_\\mu$, for the\nphase of the wave function of the colour magnetic charge, this last being a\nmonopole of the Yang-Mills field but a source of the dual field. The standard\ncolour (electric) charge itself is found to be a monopole of $\\tilde{A}_\\mu$.\nAt the same time, the gauge symmetry is found doubled from say $SU(N)$ to\n$SU(N) \\times SU(N)$. A novel feature is that all equations of motion,\nincluding the standard Yang-Mills and Wong equations, are here derived from a\n`universal' principle, namely the Wu-Yang (1976) criterion for monopoles, where\ninteractions arise purely as a consequence of the topological definition of the\nmonopole charge.

Thanks to the proximity and relatively\nsmall timescales, which permit direct observations of evolutionary changes, YSO\njets are, perhaps, the best laboratories for cosmic jet investigation.

Therefore the\nemergent $\\nu_e$ and $\\bar\\nu_e$ originate from layers with lower temperatures\nfurther out in the star and are emitted with much lower characteristic spectral\ntemperatures. In addition, a major contribution to the $\\nu_e$ and $\\bar\\nu_e$\nopacities is due to absorptions, while the opacity of $\\nu_x$ is strongly\ndominated by scattering reactions with nucleons and nuclei in which the $\\nu_x$\nenergy is (essentially) conserved. Therefore the $\\nu_x$ distribution is nearly\nisotropic when $\\nu_x$ decouple energetically and their outward diffusion is\nslowed down. In a generalized form to include this effect, the Stefan-Boltzmann\nRadiation Law can account for both the facts that $\\nu_e$ ($\\bar\\nu_e$) and\n$\\nu_x$ emerge from the star with similar luminosities but with very different\ncharacteristic spectral temperatures. Simple analytical expressions to estimate\nthe effect are given.

We derive probability distributions\nfor the minimum Lorentz expansion factor, the radiation energy, the maximum\nbaryonic mass, and the maximum surrounding gas density in the events, based on\n254 events from the second BATSE catalog. Secondly, the time variabilities of\nthe bursts in the BATSE catalog are used to place an upper bound on the\ncurvature radius of the emitting surface in the events. This is based on the\nrequirement that the emitting region seen by the observer must be sufficiently\nsmall to produce the observed variability without violating causality. Finally,\nwe discuss the association of cosmological GRB with galaxies. We consider eight\nbright and well-localized bursts detected by the Pioneer Venus Orbiter, whose\npositional error boxes contain no bright galaxies. Using the local luminosity\nfunction of galaxies, we calculate the probability for not seeing the GRB host\ngalaxy. This probability tends to increase as the width of the GRB luminosity\nfunction increases. However, the allowed width of the GRB luminosity function\nis restricted by the number-count statistics of the bursts.",

Due to the\nchange in the magnetic dipole field in curved spacetime the induced electric\nfield also changes its magnitude and direction and increases significantly near\nthe surface of the star. As a consequence the surface charge density, the\nacceleration of charged particles in vacuum magnetospheres and the space charge\ndensity in non-vacuum magnetosphere greatly increase near the surface of the\nstar.

Beyond ensuring R parity conservation, the horizontal symmetry allows\nfor the dynamical generation of a hierarchical pattern of fermion masses,\nwithout the need of any ad hoc choice of small Yukawa couplings. The structure\nof the mass matrices implies that the fourth family does not mix with the other\nthree, and that the $b',t',\\tau',\\nu'$ masses are all naturally in the 100 GeV\nrange. The model has other interesting phenomenological implications. The scale\nof the horizontal symmetry breaking is constrained by cosmological and\nastrophysical arguments to be $\\sim 10^{11}$ GeV. Then the late $b'$ decays\ncould explain a magnitude of the isotropic cosmic gamma flux. In addition, a\nlower bound of a few eV is found for the mass of the $\\tau$-neutrino, which can\nthus provide a hot component for the cosmological dark matter. Due to R parity\nconservation, the lightest supersymmetric particle is stable and can provide\nthe cold component.

Other fermion masses arise from the higher order\noperators, with natural mass hierarchy described in terms of small ratios\n$\\eps_\\Sigma=V_\\Sigma/V_H$ and $\\eps_H=V_H/M$, where $V_H$ and $V_\\Sigma$\ncorrespondingly are the $SU(6)$ and $ SU(5)$ symmetry breaking scales, and $M$\nis a large (Planck or string) scale.

The observed polarisation is also\nconsistent with the signal expected on the basis of simulations incorporating\nmeasured properties of local galaxies and modest extrapolations of the observed\nredshift distribution of faint galaxies. From the simulations we derive a\nbest-fit halo circular velocity of $V\\sim 220$ km/s and characteristic radial\nextent of $s \\go 100h^{-1}$ kpc.

An inflationary potential on moduli space can result if the scale of\ndynamical SUSY breaking in some sector of the theory is determined by a moduli\ndependent coupling. The magnitude of density fluctuations generated during\ninflation then depends on the scale of SUSY breaking in this sector. This can\nnaturally be hierarchically smaller than the Planck scale in a dynamical model,\ngiving small fluctuations without any fine tuning of parameters.

It stems from the notion of basic algebra which\npossesses both the differential structure (as functional algebras) and\nnon-commutativity (as algebras of observables in quantum theories). The main\nessence of this formalism is that it deprives the notion of spacetime as event\nsupport of its fundamental status making it relative to the measurement\nperformed. Before the observation is executed, it is pointless to speak of\nevents as points of spacetime: there is no underlying manifold.
