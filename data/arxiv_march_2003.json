This\nmap was derived from Hubble Space Telescope images that isolated the primary\nlines of HI for determination of the local extinction and of the OIII lines for\ndetermination of Tc. Although there is no statistically significant variation\nof Tc with distance from the dominant ionizing star theta1-Ori-C, we find small\nscale variations in the plane of the sky down to a few arcseconds that are\ncompatible with the variations inferred from comparing the value of Te derived\nfrom forbidden and recombination lines, commonly known as the t^2 problem. We\npresent other evidence for fine scale variations in conditions in the nebula,\nthese being variations in the surface brightness of the the nebula,\nfluctuations in radial velocities, and ionization changes. From our Tc map and\nother considerations we estimate that t^2=0.028 +-0.006 for the Orion nebula.\nShadowed regions behind clumps close to the ionization front can make a\nsignificant contribution to the observed temperature fluctuations, but they\ncannot account for the t^2 values inferred from several methods of temperature\ndetermination. It is shown that an anomalous broadening of nebular emission\nlines appears to have the same sense of correlation as the temperature\nanomalies, although a causal link is not obvious.",

    "summary": "We present a new model of high-energy lightcurves from rotation powered\npulsars. The key ingredient of the model is the gap region (i.e. the region\nwhere particle acceleration is taking place and high-energy photons originate)\nwhich satisfies the following assumptions: i) the gap region extends from each\npolar cap to the light cylinder; ii) the gap is thin and confined to the\nsurface of last open magnetic-field lines; iii) photon emissivity is uniform\nwithin the gap region. The model lightcurves are dominated by strong peaks\n(either double or single) of caustic origin. Unlike in other pulsar models with\ncaustic effects, the double peaks arise due to crossing two caustics, each of\nwhich is associated with a different magnetic pole. The generic features of the\nlightcurves are consistent with the observed characteristics of pulsar\nlightcurves: 1) the most natural (in terms of probability) shape consists of\ntwo peaks (separated by 0.4 to 0.5 in phase for large viewing angles); 2) the\npeaks posess well developed wings; 3) there is a bridge (inter-peak) emission\ncomponent; 4) there is a non-vanishing off-pulse emission level; 5) the radio\npulse occurs before the leading high-energy peak. The model is well suited for\nfour gamma-ray pulsars - Crab, Vela, Geminga and B1951+32 - with double-peak\nlightcurves exhibiting the peak separation of 0.4 to 0.5 in phase. Hereby, we\napply the model to the Vela pulsar. Moreover, we indicate the limitation of the\nmodel in accurate reproducing of the lightcurves with single pulses and\nnarrowly separated (about 0.2 in phase) pulse peaks. We also discuss the\noptical polarization properties for the Crab pulsar in the context of the\ntwo-pole caustic model.",

This paper examines the Statefinder diagnostic in the light\nof the proposed SNAP satellite which is expected to observe about 2000\nsupernovae per year. We show that the Statefinder is versatile enough to\ndifferentiate between dark energy models as varied as the cosmological constant\non the one hand, and quintessence, the Chaplygin gas and braneworld models, on\nthe other. Using SNAP data, the Statefinder can distinguish a cosmological\nconstant ($w=-1$) from quintessence models with $w \\geq -0.9$ and Chaplygin gas\nmodels with $\\kappa \\leq 15$ at the $3\\sigma$ level if the value of $\\om$ is\nknown exactly. The Statefinder gives reasonable results even when the value of\n$\\om$ is known to only $\\sim 20%$ accuracy. In this case, marginalizing over\n$\\om$ and assuming a fiducial LCDM model allows us to rule out quintessence\nwith $w \\geq -0.85$ and the Chaplygin gas with $\\kappa \\leq 7$ (both at\n$3\\sigma$). These constraints can be made even tighter if we use the\nStatefinders in conjunction with the deceleration parameter. The Statefinder is\nvery sensitive to the total pressure exerted by all forms of matter and\nradiation in the universe. It can therefore differentiate between dark energy\nmodels at moderately high redshifts of $z \\lleq 10$.",

Consequently, some\nauthors say that \"the rest mass of tachyons is imaginary\". Besides, the\nstatement \"photons have zero rest mass\" is almost common. In terms of\nrelativity, however, the state of rest cannot be reasonably defined for luxons\nand tachyons, and, therefore, today it does not make sense to speak of rest\nmass of such objects. It is shown here that the phrases \"negative squared\nmass\", \"imaginary mass\", and \"photon's zero mass\" result from applying\nbradyonic dynamical relativistic relations to determine properties of luxons\nand tachyons; and that this erroneous procedure results from an unfortunate\ninterpretation of kinematical relativistic relations. It is also shown that the\nuse of proper relativistic relations, i.e. luxonic or tachyonic ones, gives a\npositive quantity having the squared mass dimension. Thus we obtain a nonzero\nreal quantity having the mass dimension (called masslike quantity), which is\npositive for the photon and may (by intuition - should) be positive for other\nluxons and for tachyons.",

We study how it might arrive at such an orbit and how it has\navoided being tidally circularized until now. The presence of a stellar\ncompanion to the host star suggests the possibility that the Kozai mechanism\nand tidal dissipation combined to draw the planet inward well after it formed:\nKozai oscillations produce periods of extreme eccentricity in the planet orbit,\nand the tidal dissipation that occurs during these periods of small pericentre\ndistances leads to gradual orbital decay. We call this migration mechanism the\n'Kozai migration'. It requires that the initial planet orbit is highly inclined\nrelative to the binary orbit. For a companion at 1000 AU and an initial planet\norbit at 5 AU, the minimum relative inclination required is ~ 85. We discuss\nthe efficiency of tidal dissipation inferred from the observations of\nexo-planets. Moreover, we investigate possible explanations for the velocity\nresidual (after the motion induced by the planet is removed) observed on the\nhost star: a second planet in the system is excluded over a large extent of\nsemi-major axis space if Kozai migration is to work, and the tide raised on the\nstar by HD 80606b is likely too small in amplitude. Lastly, we discuss the\nrelevance of Kozai migration for other planetary systems.",

Here, we address the question of how best to\ntake advantage of cold atom properties to perform the observation of as highly\nforbidden a line as the 6S-7S Cs transition for achieving, in the longer term,\nAtomic Parity Violation measurements in radioactive alkali isotopes. Another\npoint at issue is whether one might do better with stable, cold atoms than with\nthermal atoms. To compensate for the large drawback of the small number of\natoms available in a trap, one must take advantage of their low velocity. To\nlengthen the time of interaction with the excitation laser, we suggest choosing\na geometry where the laser beam exciting the transition is colinear to a slow,\ncold atomic beam, either extracted from a trap or prepared by Zeeman slowing.\nWe also suggest a new observable physical quantity manifesting APV, which\npresents several advantages:specificity, efficiency of detection, possibility\nof direct calibration by a parity conserving quantity of a similar nature. It\nis well adapted to a configuration where the cold atomic beam passes through\ntwo regions of transverse, crossed electric fields, leading both to\ndifferential measurements and to strong reduction of the contributions from the\nM_1-Stark interference signals, potential sources of systematics in APV\nmeasurements. Our evaluation of signal to noise ratios shows that with\navailable techniques, measurements of transition amplitudes, important as\nrequired tests of Atomic Theory should be possible in cesium 133 with a\nstatistical precision of 1/1000 and probably also in Fr isotopes for production\nrates of 10^6 Fr atoms/s.",

Such perturbations can contribute significantly to\nthe CMBR temperature and polarization anisotropies at large l > 1000 or so,\nlike the excess power detected by the CBI experiment. The magnetic contribution\ncan be distinguished from most conventional signals, as they lead to CMBR\npolarization dominated by the odd parity, B-type signal. Experiments like DASI\nand WMAP have detected evidence for CMBR polarization at small l. Many\nexperiments will also probe the large $l$ regime. We therefore calculate the\npolarization signals due to primordial magnetic fields, for different spectra\nand different cosmological parameters. A scale-invariant spectrum of tangled\nfields which redshifts to a present value B_{0}=3\\times 10^{-9} Gauss, produces\nB-type polarization anisotropies of order 0.3 - 0.4 micro Kelvin between l of\n1000-5000. Larger signals result if the spectral index of magnetic tangles is\nsteeper, n>-3. The peak of the signal shifts to larger l for a lambda-dominated\nuniverse, or if the baryon density is larger. The signal will also have\nnon-Gaussian statistics. We also predict the much smaller E-type polarization,\nand T-E cross correlations for these models.",

    "summary": "Minkowski space can be sliced, outside the lightcone, in terms of Euclidean\nAnti-de Sitter and Lorentzian de Sitter slices. In this paper we investigate\nwhat happens when we apply holography to each slice separately. This yields a\ndual description living on two spheres, which can be interpreted as the\nboundary of the light cone. The infinite number of slices gives rise to a\ncontinuum family of operators on the two spheres for each separate bulk field.\nFor a free field we explain how the Green's function and (trivial) S-matrix in\nMinkowski space can be reconstructed in terms of two-point functions of some\nputative conformal field theory on the two spheres. Based on this we propose a\nMinkowski/CFT correspondence which can also be applied to interacting fields.\nWe comment on the interpretation of the conformal symmetry of the CFT, and on\ngeneralizations to curved space.",

For this, we have collected all available photometric\nobservations from the literature and constructed decades-long O-C diagrams of\nthe stars. This traditional method is useful because of the single-periodic\nnature of the light variations. Text-book examples of slow period evolution (XX\nCyg, DY Her, DY Peg) and cyclic period changes due to light-time effect (LITE)\nin a binary system (SZ Lyn) are updated with the new observations. For YZ Boo,\nwe find a period decrease instead of increase. The previously suggested\nLITE-solution of BE Lyn (Kiss & Szatmary 1995) is not supported with the new\nO-C diagram.

For concreteness, we consider a\nnoncommutative scalar field model near the horizon and derive the effective\nmetric via the equation of motion of noncommutative scalar field. This metric\ndisplays a new horizon in addition to the original one associated with the\nSchwarzschild black hole. The infinite red-shifting of the scalar field on the\nnew horizon determines the range of the noncommutativ space and explains the\nrelevant boundary condition for the field. This range enables us to calculate\nthe entropy of black hole as proportional to the area of its original horizon\nalong the same line as in 't Hooft's model, and the thickness of the brick wall\nis found to be proportional to the thermal average of the noncommutative\nspace-time range.

    "summary": "Hydrodynamic fluctuations at non-zero temperature can cause slow relaxation\ntoward equilibrium even in observables which are not locally conserved. A\nclassic example is the stress-stress correlator in a normal fluid, which, at\nzero wavenumber, behaves at large times as t^{-3/2}. A novel feature of the\neffective theory of hydrodynamic fluctuations in supersymmetric theories is the\npresence of Grassmann-valued classical fields describing macroscopic\nsupercharge density fluctuations. We show that hydrodynamic fluctuations in\nsupersymmetric theories generate essentially the same long-time power-law tails\nin real-time correlation functions that are known in simple fluids. In\nparticular, a t^{-3/2} long-time tail must exist in the stress-stress\ncorrelator of N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory at non-zero temperature,\nregardless of the value of the coupling. Consequently, this feature of\nfinite-temperature dynamics can provide an interesting test of the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence. However, the coefficient of this long-time tail is suppressed\nby a factor of 1/N_c^2. On the gravitational side, this implies that these\nlong-time tails are not present in the classical supergravity limit; they must\ninstead be produced by one-loop gravitational fluctuations.",

For most of the models\nwe find that the multicomponent wind nature is not important for either wind\ndynamics or for wind temperature stratification. However, for stars with the\nlowest metallicities we find that multicomponent effects influence the wind\nstructure. These effects range from pure heating to possible fallback of the\nnonabsorbing wind component. We present a simple formula for the calculation of\nmetallicity for which the multicomponent effects become important. We show that\nthe importance of the multicomponent nature of winds of low metallicity stars\nis characterised not only by the low density of driving ions, but also by lower\nmass-loss rate.",

Finally, I give a brief discussion of holomorphic\n$ADE$ models, focusing on the example of the $A_2$ quiver, for which I extract\nexplicitly the relevant Riemann surface. In this case, use of the holomorphic\nmodel is crucial, since the Hermitian approach and its attending regularization\nwould lead to a singular algebraic curve, thus contradicting the requirements\nof the conjecture. In particular, I show how an appropriate regularization of\nthe holomorphic $A_2$ model produces the desired smooth Riemann surface in the\nlimit when the regulator is removed, and that this limit can be described as a\nstatistical ensemble of `reduced' holomorphic models.",

The majority of DLAs show significant\nunderabundances of Ar relative to other alpha-capture elements with common\nnucleosynthetic origin. We show that neither dust depletion nor intervening HII\nregions inside DLAs offer a viable justification to these underabundances. A\nnatural explanation is found in the framework of photoionization models of HI\nregions embedded in an ionizing continuum with varying spectral distribution.\nAt z ~ 2.5 the observed Ar deficiencies are large, [Ar/alpha] ~ -0.6/-0.8 dex,\nsuggestive of a hard, QSO-dominated spectrum. At z >~ 3 the deficiencies are\ninstead small, suggestive of a soft, stellar-type spectrum, though more data\nare needed to generalize this high-z result. We argue that the change of Ar\nabundances is induced by the evolution of the UV metagalactic continuum, in\nwhich case the UV emission internal to DLAs must be small (i.e. DLAs should\nhave modest star formation rates) and the external background must become\nsofter at z > 3. The former requirement is consistent with the modest evolution\nof DLAs abundances and the lack of Ly_alpha and H_alpha emissions associated\nwith DLAs. The latter requirement is consistent with the observed evolution of\nSiIV/CIV ratios in the IGM, the claims of high escape fraction of UV photons\nfrom Ly-break galaxies at z >~ 3, and the recent finding that the HeII\nre-ionization seems to occur between z ~ 3.4 and z ~ 3.

In the present\nwork we show, based on general arguments, that the computation of this quantity\nneglecting Hard Thermal Loop vertices contradicts the Ward identity and\nviolates the thermodynamic sum rule following from the quark number\nconservation.

The caps of the cylinders have narrow\ntubes conically tapering to super narrow slits which allow for an axial flow\nalong the surface of the inner cylinder. The approximated solution for the\nCouette flow for short cylinders was found and used for the stability analysis\ninstead of the exact but bulky solution. The sensitivity of the Couette flow to\ngeneral small perturbations and to the weak axial flow was studied. We\ndemonstrate that perturbations coming from the axial flow cause the propagation\nof dispersive waves in the Taylor-Couette flow. The coexistence of a rotation\nand of an axial flow requires to study in addition to the energy and the\nangular momentum also the helicity of the flow. The approximated form for the\nhelicity formula in case of short cylinders was derived. We found that the\naxial flow stabilizes the Taylor - Couette flow. The supercritical flow\nincludes a rich variety of vortical structures including a symmetric pair of\nTaylor vortices, an anomalous single vortex and quasi periodic oscillating\nvortices.

When thus\nidentified, dual colour then predicts 3 and only 3 fermion generations, besides\nsuggesting a special Higgs mechanism for breaking the generation symmetry. A\nphenomenological model with a Higgs potential and a Yukawa coupling constructed\non these premises is shown to explain immediately all the salient qualitative\nfeatures of the fermion mass hierarchy and mixing pattern, excepting for the\nmoment CP-violation. Calculations already carried out to 1-loop order is shown\nto give with only 3 adjustable parameters the following quantities all to\nwithin present experimental error: all 9 CKM matrix elements $|V_{rs}|$ for\nquarks, the neutrino oscillation angles or the MNS lepton mixing matrix\nelements $|U_{\\mu 3}|, |U_{e 3}|$, and the mass ratios $m_c/m_t, m_s/m_b,\nm_\\mu/m_\\tau$.

For the origin of the 3D turbulence a new mechanism is proposed.\nOwing to the strongly stable stratification, the mean radial shear is stable,\nwhile the horizontal shear is expected to drive predominantly horizontal,\nquasi-2D motions in thin slabs. Here I suggest that a major source of 3D\noverturning turbulent motions in the tachocline is the secondary shear\ninstability due to the strong, random vertical shear arising between the\nuncorrelated horizontal flows in neighbouring slabs. A formula for the vertical\ndiffusivity due to this turbulence, equation (9), is derived and applied in a\nsimplified 1D model of the tachocline. It is found that Maxwell stresses due to\nan oscillatory poloidal magnetic field of a few hundred gauss are able to\nconfine the tachocline to a thickness below 5 Mm. The integral scale of the 3D\noverturning turbulence is the buoyancy scale, on the order of 10 km and its\nvelocity amplitude is a few m/s, yielding a vertical turbulent diffusivity on\nthe order of 10^8 cm^2/s.",

The reason for this might be that the\ncore collapse time scales for such populous clusters are greater than the age\nof the Galaxy. Among those clusters, for which the structure has not been\nmodified by core collapse, there is a correlation between central concentration\nand integrated luminosity, in the sense that the most luminous clusters have\nthe strongest central concentration. The outermost region of the Galaxy with\n$R>10$ kpc was apparently not able to form metal-rich $([Fe/H]>-1.0)$ globular\nclusters, whereas such clusters (of which Ter 7 is the prototype) were able to\nform in some nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies.

An incompletely-sampled spectral\nline map of a region of size 26 x 19 arcmin around Sgr B2 reveals three\nnoteworthy features. First, absorption by foreground water vapor is detectable\nat local standard-of-rest (LSR) velocities in the range -100 to 0 km/s at\nalmost every observed position. Second, spatially-extended emission by water is\ndetectable at LSR velocities in the range 80 to 120 km/s at almost every\nobserved position. This emission is attributable to the 180-pc molecular ring\nidentified from previous observations of CO. The typical peak antenna\ntemperature of 0.075 K for this component implies a typical water abundance of\n1.2E-6 to 8E-6 relative to H2. Third, strong absorption by water is observed\nwithin 5 arcmin of Sgr B2 at LSR velocities in the range 60 to 82 km/s. An\nanalysis of this absorption yields a H2O abundance ~ 2E-7 to 4E-7 relative to\nH2 if the absorbing water vapor is located within the core of Sgr B2 itself;\nor, alternatively, a water column density ~ 2.5E+16 to 4E+16 per cm2 if the\nwater absorption originates in the warm, foreground layer of gas proposed\npreviously as the origin of ammonia absorption observed toward Sgr B2.",

The polarization is a signature of the motion\nof the primordial seeds that led to the galaxies and large-scale structure of\nthe Universe observed today. Earlier measurements of tiny temperature\nfluctuations in the CMB have been used to infer the sizes of the primordial\nseeds.

Motivated by the inconsistent abundance and temperature\ndeterminations obtained by different observers for X-ray groups, we provide a\ndetailed investigation of the systematic errors on the derived abundances\nconsidering the effects of the temperature distribution, calibration, plasma\ncodes, bandwidth, Galactic Nh, and background rate. The iron abundance (Fe)\ndrops from Fe ~1 solar within R ~50 kpc to Fe ~0.4 solar near R=100 kpc. This\nradial decline in Fe is highly significant: Fe=1.09 +/- 0.04 solar (stat) +/-\n0.05 solar + 0.18 solar (sys) within R=48 kpc (5') compared to Fe=0.44 +/- 0.02\nsolar (stat) +/- 0.10 solar + 0.13 solar (sys) over R=48-96 kpc (5'-10'). The\ndata rule out with high confidence a very sub-solar value for Fe within R=48\nkpc confirming that previous claims of very sub-solar central Fe values in NGC\n5044 were primarily the result of the Fe Bias: i.e., the incorrect assumption\nof spatially isothermal and single-phase gas when in fact temperature\nvariations exist. Within R=48 kpc we obtain Si/Fe = 0.83 +/- 0.02 (stat) +/-\n0.02 + 0.07 (sys) and S/Fe = 0.54 +/- 0.02 (stat) +/- 0.01 + 0.01 (sys) in\nsolar units. These ratios are consistent with their values at larger radii and\nimply that SNIa have contributed ~80% of the iron mass within a 100 kpc radius\nof NGC 5044. This SNIa fraction is similar to the Sun and suggests an IMF\nsimilar to that of the Milky Way. At the very center (R ~2 kpc) the XMM and\nChandra CCDs and the XMM RGS show that the Fe drops to ~50% of its value at\nimmediately larger radius analogously to that seen in some galaxy clusters.\n(Abridged)",

These results\nare in reasonable agreement with the recent measurements of PVDs in the Las\nCampanas redshift survey, the PSCz catalogue and the SDSS data.

In our simulation, the mean infall velocity of young\ngalaxies is significantly lower than that of all the galaxies or of the old\ngalaxies, and the dynamical bias becomes important on scales less than 3Mpc/h.\nThe mass density field reconstructed from the velocity field of young galaxies\nusing the POTENT-style method suffers in accuracy both from the spatial bias\nand the dynamical friction on the smoothing scale of R_s=8Mpc/h.

    "summary": "The Owl Nebula is a triple-shell planetary nebula with the outermost shell\nbeing a faint bow-shaped halo. We have obtained deep narrow-band images and\nhigh-dispersion echelle spectra in the H-alpha, [O III], and [N II] emission\nlines to determine the physical structure of each shell in the nebula. These\nspatio-kinematic data allow us to rule out hydrodynamic models that can\nreproduce only the nebular morphology. Our analysis shows that the inner shell\nof the main nebula is slightly elongated with a bipolar cavity along its major\naxis, the outer nebula is a filled envelope co-expanding with the inner shell\nat 40 km/s, and the halo has been braked by the interstellar medium as the Owl\nNebula moves through it. To explain the morphology and kinematics of the Owl\nNebula, we suggest the following scenario for its formation and evolution. The\nearly mass loss at the TP-AGB phase forms the halo, and the superwind at the\nend of the AGB phase forms the main nebula. The subsequent fast stellar wind\ncompressed the superwind to form the inner shell and excavated an elongated\ncavity at the center, but has ceased in the past. At the current old age, the\ninner shell is backfilling the central cavity.",

    "summary": "Mg isotopic abundance ratios are measured in 20 bright red giants in globular\ncluster NGC 6752 based on very high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra\nobtained with UVES on the VLT. There is a considerable spread in the ratio\n24Mg:25Mg:26Mg with values ranging from 53:9:39 to 83:10:7. We measured the\nabundances of O, Na, Mg, Al, and Fe combining our sample with 21 RGB bump stars\n(Grundahl et al. 2002). The abundances of the samples are consistent and\nexhibit the usual anticorrelations between O-Na and Mg-Al. A positive\ncorrelation is found between 26Mg and Al, a mild anticorrelation is found\nbetween 24Mg and Al, while no correlation is found between 25Mg and Al. None of\nthe elemental or isotopic abundances show a dependence on evolutionary status\nand, as shown by Gratton et al. (2001), the abundance variations exist even in\nmain sequence stars. This strongly suggests that the star-to-star abundance\nvariations are a result of varying degrees of pollution with intermediate mass\nAGB stars being likely polluters. Even for the least polluted stars, the\nabundances of 25Mg and 26Mg relative to 24Mg are considerably higher than\npredicted for ejecta from Z=0 supernovae. Zero metallicity AGB stars may be\nresponsible for these higher abundances. Our measured Mg isotopic ratios reveal\nanother layer to the globular cluster star-to-star abundance variations that\ndemands extensions of our present theoretical knowledge of stellar\nnucleosynthesis by giant stars.",

Different solutions arise for different\nvalues of the dimensionless collisionality parameter, Q=sigma*rho_b*r_s, where\nsigma is the SIDM particle scattering cross section per unit mass, rho_b is the\ncosmic mean density, and r_s is the shock radius. For all solutions, a\nflat-density, isothermal core is present which grows in size as a fixed\nfraction of r_s, pumped by cosmological infall. Accordingly, core collapse must\nin general be delayed until infall becomes negligible, contrary to previous\nanalyses based on isolated halos, which predict core collapse in a Hubble time.\nOur solutions agree with N-body simulations, which match observed galactic\nrotation curves if sigma=[0.56 - 5.6]cm^2/g, implying Q=[6.2e-7 - 3.6e-5].\nSimilar profiles also arise for Q=[1.37e-2 - 1.7e-1], or sigma=[1.2e4 -\n2.7e4]cm^2/g, a regime not previously simulated.",

If the\ntrue peak of the Lyman alpha emission is at the same redshift, then a large\nfraction of the flux blueward of the peak is absorbed. The equivalent width of\nthe MgII emission line is similar to that of lower redshift quasars, suggesting\nthat the UV continuum is not dominated by a beamed component. Making basic\nassumptions about the line-emitting gas we derive an estimate for the central\nblack hole in this quasar of 3x10^9 solar masses.

    "summary": "A simple model for the reheating of the universe after inflation is studied\nin which an essentially inhomogeneous scalar field representing matter is\ncoupled to an essentially homogeneous scalar inflaton field. Through this\ncoupling, the potential determining the evolution of the inflaton field is made\ntime-dependent. Due to this the frequency of parametric resonance becomes time\ndependent, making the reheating process especially effective. All fields\nincluding the gravitational field are initially simplified by expanding each in\nterms of the respective homogeneity or inhomogeneity. Employing only the lowest\norder of this expansion, we space-average, and introduce all independent\naverages as new variables. This leads to a hierarchy of equations for the\nspatial moments of the fields and their derivatives. A small expansion\nparameter permits a truncation to lowest order, yielding a closed system of 5\ncoupled nonlinear first order differential equations. For a parabolic\npotential, the energy densities of the matter and inflaton fields oscillate\nchaotically around each other from the end of inflation until they reach\nextremely small values. The average period of preponderance of one of the two\ncontinuously increases in this process. We discuss that this may provide one\nclue to a solution of the coincidence problem. For a Mexican hat potential we\ncan easily obtain and understand dynamical symmetry breaking.",

It is also demonstrated that both of the\nelectron and nuclear pressures become zero at the same time for a metal in the\nvacuum, in contrast to the conventional viewpoint that the zero pressure is\nrealized by a result of the cancellation between the electron and nuclear\npressures, each of which is not zero. On the basis of these facts, a simple\nequation of states for liquid metals is derived, and examined numerically for\nliquid alkaline metals by use of the quantum hypernetted chain equation and the\nAshcroft model potential.",

The Ks-band luminosity\nfunction of the cluster galaxies is well represented by the Schechter function\nwith a characteristic magnitude Ks*=18.90 (-0.57/+0.45) and faint-end slope\nalpha=-0.60 (-0.33/+0.39), consistent with what is expected for a passively\nevolving population of galaxies formed at high redshift, zf>2. From the total\nKs-band flux of the cluster galaxies and a dynamical estimate of the total mass\nof the cluster, the restframe Ks-band mass-to-light ratio of the cluster is\nderived to be M/L=27(-17/+64)(h_50)(M/L)_{sun}, in agreement with the upper\nlimit derived earlier from Chandra X-ray observations and the value derived\nlocally in the Coma cluster. The cluster galaxies span a red sequence with a\nconsiderable scatter in the colour-magnitude diagrams, suggesting that they\ncontain young stellar populations in addition to the old populations of\nmain-sequence stars that dominate the Ks-band luminosity function. This is in\nagreement with spectroscopic observations which show that 5 out of the 6\ngalaxies in the field confirmed to be at the redshift of the lensing galaxy\nhave emission lines. The projected spatial distribution of the cluster galaxies\nis filamentary-like rather than centrally concentrated around the lensing\ngalaxy, and show no apparent luminosity segregation. A handful of the cluster\ngalaxies show evidence of merging/interaction. The results presented in this\npaper suggest that a young cluster of galaxies is assembling around MG2016+112.",

    "summary": "A major problem in extragalactic astronomy is the inability to distinguish in\na robust, physical, and model independent way how galaxy populations are\nrelated to each other and to their formation histories. A similar, but\ndistinct, and also long standing question is whether the structural appearances\nof galaxies, as seen through their stellar light distributions, contain enough\nphysical information to offer this classification. We argue through the use of\n240 images of nearby galaxies that three model independent parameters measured\non a single galaxy image reveal its major ongoing and past formation modes, and\ncan be used as a robust classification system. These parameters quantitatively\nmeasure: the concentration (C), asymmetry (A) and clumpiness (S) of a galaxy's\nstellar light distribution. When combined into a three dimensional `CAS' volume\nall major classes of galaxies in various phases of evolution are cleanly\ndistinguished. We argue that these three parameters correlate with important\nmodes of galaxy evolution: star formation and major merging activity. This is\nargued through the strong correlation of Halpha equivalent width and broad band\ncolors with the clumpiness parameter, the uniquely large asymmetries of 66\ngalaxies undergoing mergers, and the correlation of bulge to total light\nratios, and stellar masses, with the concentration index. As an obvious goal is\nto use this system at high redshifts to trace evolution, we demonstrate that\nthese parameters can be measured, within a reasonable and quantifiable\nuncertainty, with available data out to z ~ 3 using the Hubble Space Telescope\nGOODS ACS and Hubble Deep Field images.",

The comparison between the two methods clearly\ndemonstrates the superior performance of the DTFE with respect to conventional\nSPH methods, in particular at locations where SPH appears to fail. The DTFE is\na fully self-adaptive technique for reconstructing continuous density fields\nfrom discrete particle distributions, and is based upon the corresponding\nDelaunay tessellation. Its principal asset is its complete independence of\narbitrary smoothing functions and parameters specifying the properties of\nthese. As a result it manages to faithfully reproduce the anisotropies of the\nlocal particle distribution and through its adaptive and local nature proves to\nbe optimally suited for uncovering the full structural richness in the density\ndistribution. Through the improvement in local density estimates, calculations\ninvoking the DTFE will yield a much better representation of physical processes\nwhich depend on density. The presented results form an encouraging step towards\nthe application and insertion of the DTFE in astrophysical hydrocodes. We\ndescribe an outline for the construction of a particle hydrodynamics code in\nwhich the DTFE replaces kernel-based methods. Further discussion addresses the\nissue and possibilities for a moving grid based hydrocode invoking the DTFE,\nand Delaunay tessellations, in an attempt to combine the virtues of the\nEulerian and Lagrangian approaches.",

In the case of symmetric couplings, we find evidence for\na transition from a spin-glass-like phase to a ferromagnet-like phase as the\nacquisition strength of the stored pattern is increased from zero. In the\nferromagnetic phase, we find the existence of two types of phase-space\nstructure for $m > 0$ where $m$ is the overlap of the state of the system with\nthe stored pattern: a simple phase-space structure where all initial states\nwith $m > 0$ flow to the attractor corresponding to the stored pattern; and a\ncomplex phase-space structure with many attractors with their basins of\nattraction. The presence of random asymmetry in the couplings results in better\nretrieval performance of the network by enhancing the size of the basin of\nattraction of the stored pattern and by making the recall of memory\nsignificantly faster.",

The last conditions are not related to the\nvariational principle and are not considered as constraints used in the process\nof variations. The application of the whole structure of a Lagrangian theory\nwith an appropriate choice of Lagrangian invariant as the pressure of the fluid\nshows that the Euler-Lagrange equations with their corresponding\nenergy-momentum tensors lead to Navier-Stokes' equation identical with the\nEuler equation for a perfect fluid in a space with one affine connection and\nmetrics.

    "summary": "The foundations of the Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) distributions for describing\nequilibrium statistical mechanics of systems are examined. Broadly, they fall\ninto: (i) probabilistic paaroaches based on the principle of equal a priori\nprobability (counting technique and method of steepest descents), law of large\nnumbers, or the state density considerations and (ii) a variational scheme --\nmaximum entropy principle (due to Gibbs and Jaynes) subject to certain\nconstraints. A minimum set of requirements on each of these methods are briefly\npointed out: in the first approach, the function space and the counting\nalgorithm while in the second, \"additivity\" property of the entropy with\nrespect to the composition of statistically independent systems. In the past\nfew decades, a large number of systems, which are not necessarily in\nthermodynamic equilibrium (such as glasses, for example), have been found to\ndisplay power-law distributions, which are not describable by the\nabove-mentioned methods. In this paper, parallel to all the inquiries\nunderlying the BG program described above are given in a brief form. In\nparticular, in the probabilistic derivations, one employs a different function\nspace and one gives up \"additivity\" in the variational scheme with a different\nform for the entropy. The requirement of stability makes the entropy choice to\nbe that proposed by Tsallis. From this a generalized thermodynamic description\nof the system in a quasi-equilibrium state is derived. A brief account of a\nunified consistent formalism associated with systems obeying power-law\ndistributions precursor to the exponential form associated with thermodynamic\nequilibrium of systems is presented here.",

    "summary": "Finite size effects in the localization properties of disordered quantum\nwires are analyzed through conductance calculations. Disorder is induced by\nintroducing vacancies at random positions in the wire and thus preserving the\nchiral symmetry. For quasi one-dimensional geometries and low concentration of\nvacancies, an exponential decay of the mean conductance with the wire length is\nobtained even at the center of the energy band. For wide wires, finite size\neffects cause the conductance to decay following a non-pure exponential law. We\npropose an analytical formula for the mean conductance that reproduces\naccurately the numerical data for both geometries. However, when the\nconcentration of vacancies increases above a critical value, a transition\ntowards the suppression of the conductance occurs.\n  This is a signature of the presence of ultra-localized states trapped in\nfinite regions of the sample.",

Using\npulsar-gated radio imaging data taken at a center frequency of 2496 MHz with\nthe Australia Telescope Compact Array, we have determined a rotation measure\nfor the pulsar of +842 +/- 23 rad m^-2. These data, combined with archival\npolarimetry data taken at a center frequency of 1366 MHz with the Parkes\ntelescope, were used to determine the polarization characteristics of PSR\nJ1119-6127 at both frequencies. The pulsar has a fractional linear polarization\nof ~75% and ~55% at 1366 and 2496 MHz, respectively, and the profile consists\nof a single, wide component. This pulse morphology and high degree of linear\npolarization are in agreement with previously noticed trends for young pulsars\n(e.g., PSR J1513-5908). A rotating-vector (RV) model fit of the position angle\n(PA) of linear polarization over pulse phase using the Parkes data suggests\nthat the radio emission comes from the leading edge of a conal beam. We discuss\nPSR J1119-6127 in the context of a recent theoretical model of pulsar spin-down\nwhich can in principle be tested with polarization and timing data from this\npulsar. Geometric constraints from the RV fit are currently insufficient to\ntest this model with statistical significance, but additional data may allow\nsuch a test in the future.",

Using the 2dF fiber\nspectrograph, we have searched for the luminosity at which lithium remains\nunburned in an attempt to constrain the cluster age. The lack of a population\nof individual lithium-rich objects towards the faint end of our sample places a\nvery strong lower limit to the cluster age of 35 Myr. However, the detection of\nlithium in the averaged spectra of our faintest targets suggests that the\nlithium depletion boundary lies at 9.5 < M(I) < 10.0 and that the cluster age\nis < 54 Myr. The age of NGC 2547 judged from fitting isochrones to low-mass\npre-main-sequence stars in colour-magnitude diagrams is 20-35 Myr using the\nsame evolutionary models. The sense and size of the discrepancy in age\ndetermined by these two techniques is similar to that found in another young\ncluster, IC 2391, and in the low-mass pre main-sequence binary system, GJ\n871.1AB. We suggest that the inclusion of rotation or dynamo-generated magnetic\nfields in the evolutionary models could reconcile the two age determinations,\nbut only at the expense of increasing the cluster ages beyond that currently\nindicated by the lithium depletion. Alternatively, some mechanism is required\nthat increases the rate of lithium depletion in young, very low-mass fully\nconvective stars.",

We determine the relative\nrole of the small ($\\sim Q^2$) and large ($\\gg Q^2$) diffractive masses in\nnuclear shadowing as a function of $x$ and find that the large mass\ncontribution, which is an analog of the triple Pomeron exchange, becomes\nsignificant only for $x \\le 10^{-4}$.

Also, we find that the next-to-leading order effects in nuclear shadowing\nin the ratio of the nucleus to nucleon structure functions $F_2$ are quite\nsizable. Within the same formalism, we also present results for the impact\nparameter dependence of nPDFs. We also address the problem of extracting of the\nneutron\n  $F_{2n}(x,Q^2)$ from the deuteron and proton data.

The two main emission component, the black\nbody and the Comptonized tail that are clearly identified in the time-averaged\nspectrum, show strong variability with the first component lagging the second\none. The observed variability can be explained if the emission is produced by\nComptonization in a hot slab (radiative shock) of Thomson optical depth ~0.3-1\nat the neutron star surface. The emission patterns of the black body and the\nComptonized radiation are different: a \"knife\"- and a \"fan\"-like, respectively.\nWe construct a detailed model of the X-ray production accounting for the\nDoppler boosting, relativistic aberration and gravitational light bending in\nthe Schwarzschild spacetime. We present also accurate analytical formulae for\ncomputations of the light curves from rapidly rotating neutron stars using\nformalism recently developed by Beloborodov (2002). Our model reproduces well\nthe pulse profiles at different energies simultaneously, corresponding phase\nlags, as well as the time-averaged spectrum. We constrain the compact star mass\nto be bounded between 1.2 and 1.6 solar masses. By fitting the observed\nprofiles, we determine the radius of the compact object to be R~11 km if M=1.6\nM_sun, while for M=1.2 M_sun the best-fitting radius is ~6.5 km, indicating\nthat the compact object in SAX J1808.4-3658 can be a strange star.

However, it is now quite likely that they may provide a fundamental link\nbetween classical general relativity and quantum theories of gravity. Here we\ncarry out the first numerical computation of very highly damped quasinormal\nmodes (QNM's) for charged and rotating black holes. In the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om\ncase QNM frequencies and damping times show an oscillatory behaviour as a\nfunction of charge. The oscillations become faster as the mode order increases.\nAt fixed mode order, QNM's describe spirals in the complex plane as the charge\nis increased, tending towards a well defined limit as the hole becomes\nextremal. Kerr QNM's have a similar oscillatory behaviour when the angular\nindex $m=0$. For $l=m=2$ the real part of Kerr QNM frequencies tends to\n$2\\Omega$, $\\Omega$ being the angular velocity of the black hole horizon, while\nthe asymptotic spacing of the imaginary parts is given by $2\\pi T_H$.",

The main difference between the luminosity distributions\nof the UCM sample and the luminosity functions of the local galaxy population\nis a lower normalization (phi^*), indicating a lower global volume density of\nUCM galaxies. The typical near-infrared luminosity (L^*) of local star-forming\ngalaxies is fainter than that of normal galaxies. This is a direct consequence\nof the lower stellar masses of our objects. However, at optical wavelengths (B\nand r) the luminosity enhancement arising from the young stars leads to M^*\nvalues that are similar to those of normal galaxies. The fraction of the total\noptical and near infrared luminosity density in the local Universe associated\nwith star-forming galaxies is 10-20%. Fitting the total stellar mass function\nusing a Schechter parametrization we obtain alpha=-1.15+/-0.15,\nlog({M}^*)=10.82+/-0.17 Msun and log(phi^*)=-3.04+/-0.20 Mpc^{-3}.

While it is established that the effect of\nneutrinos on the evolution of cosmic structure is small, the upper limits\nderived from large-scale structure data could help significantly to constrain\nthe absolute scale of the neutrino masses. In a recent paper the 2dF Galaxy\nRedshift Survey (2dFGRS) team provided an upper limit m_nu,tot < 2.2 eV, i.e.\napproximately 0.7 eV for each of the three neutrino flavours, or phrased in\nterms of their contributioin to the matter density, Omega_nu/Omega_m < 0.16.\nHere we discuss this analysis in greater detail, considering issues of assumed\n'priors' like the matter density Omega_m and the bias of the galaxy\ndistribution with respect the dark matter distribution. As the suppression of\nthe power spectrum depends on the ratio Omega_nu/Omega_m, we find that the\nout-of- fashion Mixed Dark Matter Model, with Omega_nu=0.2, Omega_m=1 and no\ncosmological constant, fits the 2dFGRS power spectrum and the CMB data\nreasonably well, but only for a Hubble constant H_0<50 km/s/Mpc. As a\nconsequence, excluding low values of the Hubble constant, e.g. with the HST Key\nProject is important in order to get a strong constraint on the neutrino\nmasses. We also comment on the improved limit by the WMAP team, and point out\nthat the main neutrino signature comes from the 2dFGRS and the Lyman alpha\nforest.",

There is a large variation in the ERO surface density from\nfield to field, and as many as 30--40 % of the fields have roughly 4--5 times\nmore EROs than what is expected from a random distribution. The average surface\ndensity exceeds the value found in large random-field surveys by a factor of\n2--3, a result which is significant at the >3 sigma level. Hence, it appears\nthat the quasar lines of sight are biassed towards regions of high ERO density.\nThis might be caused by clusters or groups of galaxies physically associated\nwith the quasars. However, an equally likely possibility is that the observed\nERO excess is part of overdensities in the ERO population along the line of\nsight to the quasars. In this case, the non-randomness of quasar fields with\nrespect to EROs may be explained in terms of gravitational lensing.",

Spectra\nextracted from the entire circumference of the blast wave reveal the broad and\nnarrow component H-alpha line emission characteristic of non-radiative shocks\nin partially neutral gas. The new spectra of DEM L71 include portions of the\nrim that have not been previously observed. We find that the broad component\nwidth varies azimuthally along the edge of DEM L71, ranging from 450+/-60 km/s\nalong the eastern edge to values as high as 985 (+210)(-165) km/s along the\nfaint western edge. In part of the faint northern rim the broad component is\nnot detected, possibly indicating a lower density in these regions and/or a\nbroad component width in excess of 1000 km/s. Between the limits of zero and\nfull electron-ion temperature equilibration at the shock front, the allowed\nrange of shock velocities is 430-560 km/s along the east rim and 700-1250 km/s\nalong other parts of the blast wave. The H-alpha broad-to-narrow flux ratios\nvary considerably around the remnant, ranging from 0.4 to 0.8. These ratios lie\nbelow the values predicted by our shock models. We find that narrow component\nH-alpha emission from a cosmic ray precursor may be the cause of the\ndiscrepancy. The least decelerated portions of the blast wave (i.e., regions\nexcluding the brightest filaments) are well characterized by Sedov models with\na kinetic energy E_51= (0.37+/-0.06)*D_50**(5/2), where D_50 is the LMC\ndistance in units of 50 kpc.

We have used both Chandra ACIS-S data and optical Fabry-Perot\nspectra of the blast wave to measure the electron and proton temperatures,\nrespectively. In principle, when combined, these measurements can determine the\ndegree of electron-ion temperature equilibration (g_0 = T_e/T_p) immediately\nbehind the shock front. In our X-ray analysis we fit Chandra spectra of three\nnested regions behind the blast wave under three different scenarios: (1) a\nplanar, initially unequilibrated shock (g_0 = m_e/m_p), where the downstream\nelectron and proton temperatures equilibrate through Coulomb collisions, (2) a\nplanar, immediately equilibrated shock (g_0 = 1) and (3) a spherical,\nequilibrated shock under Sedov evolution. Using independent measurements of T_e\nand T_p we find that the X-ray spectra from the fastest blast wave locations\n(V_s~700-1000 km/s) are consistent with little or no equilibration at the shock\nfront and are inconsistent with full equilibration. In contrast, spectra from\nregions showing slower blast wave speeds (V_s~400-600 km/s) allow full\nequilibration but exclude zero equilibration. In order to directly constrain\nthe initial equilibration, we incorporated our knowledge of the proton\ntemperatures into our X-ray models to build planar shock models that allowed\nfor a variable g_0. This model confirmed and strengthened the above results.\nSpecifically, we found that X-ray spectra from an intermediate velocity shock\n(V_s~800 km/s) were consistent with intermediate equilibration, excluding both\ng_0 = m_e/m_p and g_0 = 1 at greater than 1 sigma.

A natural question is how many clusters are\nappropriate for the description of a given system. Traditional approaches to\nthis problem are based either on a framework in which clusters of a particular\nshape are assumed as a model of the system or on a two-step procedure in which\na clustering criterion determines the optimal assignments for a given number of\nclusters and a separate criterion measures the goodness of the classification\nto determine the number of clusters. In a statistical mechanics approach,\nclustering can be seen as a trade--off between energy-- and entropy--like\nterms, with lower temperature driving the proliferation of clusters to provide\na more detailed description of the data. For finite data sets, we expect that\nthere is a limit to the meaningful structure that can be resolved and therefore\na minimum temperature beyond which we will capture sampling noise. This\nsuggests that correcting the clustering criterion for the bias which arises due\nto sampling errors will allow us to find a clustering solution at a temperature\nwhich is optimal in the sense that we capture maximal meaningful structure --\nwithout having to define an external criterion for the goodness or stability of\nthe clustering.

    "summary": "We have performed a thorough analysis of the constraints which can be put on\nneutrino parameters from cosmological observations, most notably those from the\nWMAP satellite and the 2dF galaxy survey. For this data we find an upper limit\non the sum of active neutrino mass eigenstates of \\sum m_nu < 1.0 eV (95%\nconf.), but this limit is dependent on priors. We find that the WMAP and 2dF\ndata alone cannot rule out the evidence from neutrinoless double beta decay\nreported by the Heidelberg-Moscow experiment. In terms of the relativistic\nenergy density in neutrinos or other weakly interacting species we find, in\nunits of the equivalent number of neutrino species, N_nu, that N_nu =\n4.0+3.0-2.1 (95% conf.). When BBN constraints are added, the bound on N_\\nu is\n2.6+0.4-0.3 (95% conf.), suggesting that N_nu could possibly be lower than the\nstandard model value of 3. This can for instance be the case in models with\nvery low reheating temperature and incomplete neutrino thermalization.\nConversely, if N_nu is fixed to 3 then the data from WMAP and 2dFGRS predicts\nthat 0.2458 < Y_P < 0.2471, which is significantly higher than the\nobservationally measured value. The limit on relativistic energy density\nchanges when a small $\\nu_e$ chemical potential is present during BBN. In this\ncase the upper bound on N_nu from WMAP, 2dFGRS and BBN is N_nu < 6.5. Finally,\nwe find that a non-zero \\sum m_nu can be compensated by an increase in N_nu.\nOne result of this is that the LSND result is not yet ruled out by cosmological\nobservations.",

We consider magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) accretion flows\nwith a spherically symmetric density distribution at the outer boundary, but\nwith spherical symmetry broken by the introduction of a small,\nlatitude-dependent angular momentum and a weak radial magnetic field. We study\naccretion flows by means of numerical 2D, axisymmetric, MHD simulations with\nand without resistive heating. Our main result is that the properties of the\naccretion flow depend mostly on an equatorial accretion torus which is made of\nthe material that has too much angular momentum to be accreted directly. The\ntorus accretes, however, because of the transport of angular momentum due to\nthe magnetorotational instability (MRI). Initially, accretion is dominated by\nthe polar funnel, as in the hydrodynamic inviscid case, where material has zero\nor very low angular momentum. At the later phase of the evolution, the torus\nthickens towards the poles and develops a corona or an outflow or both.\nConsequently, the mass accretion through the funnel is stopped. The accretion\nof rotating gas through the torus is significantly reduced compared to the\naccretion of non-rotating gas (i.e., the Bondi rate). It is also much smaller\nthan the accretion rate in the inviscid, weakly rotating case.Our results do\nnot change if we switch on or off resistive heating.

We analyze the thermal stability of the gas using a\nLagrangian perturbation analysis. For thermal conductivity at the level of\n20-40 % of Spitzer conductivity, consistent with previous estimates for cluster\ngas, we find that the growth rate of the most unstable global radial mode is ~\n6-9 times lower than the growth rate of local isobaric modes at the cluster\ncenter in the absence of conduction. The growth time in typical clusters is ~\n2-5 Gyr, which is comparable to the time since the last major merger episode,\nwhen the gas was presumably well mixed. Thus, we suggest that thermal\ninstability is not dynamically significant in clusters, provided there is an\nadequate level of thermal conduction. On the other hand, if the heating of the\ngas is not the result of thermal conduction or any other diffusive process such\nas turbulent mixing, then the thermal instability has a growth time under a Gyr\nin the central regions of the cluster and is a serious threat to equilibrium.\nWe also analyze local nonradial modes and show that the Lagrangian technique\nleads to the same dispersion relation as the Eulerian approach, provided that\nclusters are initially in strict thermal equilibrium.

Investigating compressive\nversus shear modes separately, we evaluate their relative total power, and find\nthat as the magnetic field strength decreases, (1) the shear fraction of the\ntotal kinetic power decreases, and (2) slopes of power-law fits over the\ninertial range steepen. To relate to previous work on incompressible MHD\nturbulence, we present qualitative and quantitative measures of the\nscale-dependent spectral anisotropy arising from the shear-Alfv\\'{e}n cascade,\nand show how these vary with changing mean magnetic field strength. Finally, we\npropose a method for using anisotropy in velocity centroid maps as a diagnostic\nof the mean magnetic field strength in observed cloud cores.",

In order to study the propagation\nof metric, dilaton, and Kalb-Ramond two-form, we perform the perturbation\nanalysis in the southern diamond of Kerr-de Sitter space including a conical\nsingularity.

While, Kerr metric is used to\ndescribe the pseudo-Newtonian potential for accretion disk around black hole,\nthe Hartle-Thorne metric is considered to describe disk around neutron star.\nTwo other potentials were proposed to describe the temporal effects of the\naccretion disk. Using these potentials, I study the global parameter space of\nthe accretion disk around black holes and neutron stars. I show that, for\ndifferent angular momenta of the compact object, the valid disk parameter\nregion dramatically changes and disk may become unstable in certain situations.\nTo bring it in the stable situation, the angular momentum of the accreting\nmatter has to be reduced/enhanced (for co/counter-rotating disk) by means of\nsome physical process. I also study, how the fluid properties get changed with\ndifferent rotations of the compact objects. Moreover, I show the effect of\nviscosity to the fluid properties of the disk.

Ekedahl, 1983). b) over a finite field of\ncardinal $q$, a proper smooth variety which is rationally chain connected, or\nFano, or weakly unirational, has a number of rational points congruent to 1\nmodulo $q$ (Esnault, 2003). c) over an algebraic closed field of caracteristic\n$p>0$, the fundamental group of a proper smooth variety which is rationally\nchain connected, or Fano, or weakly unirational, is a finite group of order\nprime to $p$ (cf. Ekedahl, 1983). The common feature of the proofs is a control\nof the $p$-adic valuations of Frobenius and is best explained within the\nframework of Berthelot's rigid cohomology.

    "summary": "We study the potential of high-energy photon colliders for the production of\ngluino pairs within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). In this\nmodel, the process gamma gamma -> gluino gluino is mediated by quark/squark box\ndiagrams with enhancements for up-type quarks/squarks from their larger charges\nand for third generation squarks from their large mass splittings, generated by\nthe mixing of left- and right-handed states. Far above threshold and in\nscenarios with very heavy squarks, resolved photons can contribute\nsignificantly at tree level. Taking into account the laser photon\nbackscattering spectrum, electron and laser beam polarization effects, and\ncurrent mass exclusion limits, we find that gluino pair production in\nhigh-energy photon collisions should be visible over large regions of the MSSM\nparameter space, contrary to what has been found for e^+e^- annihilation. In\naddition, the cross section rises rather steeply, so that a gluino mass\ndetermination with a precision of a few GeV should be feasible for a wide range\nof post-LEP benchmark points.",

In order to understand the origin of metastability,\nwhich appears in an energy region below the critical point, we consider two\ndifferent classes of out-of-equilibrium initial conditions, both leading to\nQSS, and having respectively initial magnetization equal to one (M1 IC) and\nequal to zero (M0 IC). We compare the corresponding $\\mu$-space, the resulting\nvelocity pdfs and correlations, and the eventual aging features of the\nmicroscopic dynamics. In both cases the model exhibits non-gaussian pdfs,\nthough anomalous correlations are present only when the system is started with\nan initial magnetization equal to one. In the M0 IC case the relaxation to\nequilibrium is almost exponential, while,for M1 IC, when correlations and aging\nare found, the decay is a power-law and the overall behavior can be very well\nreproduced by a Tsallis q-exponential function. These results contribute to\nclarify the overall scenario, which is more complex than previously expected\nand stress the importance of the dynamics in the relaxation process. The\nnonextensive statistical mechanics formalism proposed by Tsallis seems to be\nvalid, in the out-of-equilibrium phase, when correlations and strong long-term\nmemory effects emerge.

The TNO binaries\nare strikingly different from asteroid binaries in four respects (Veillet et al\n2002): their frequency is an order of magnitude larger, the mass ratio of their\ncomponents is closer to unity, and their orbits are wider and highly eccentric.\nTwo explanations have been proposed for their formation, one assuming large\nnumbers of massive bodies (Weidenschilling 2002), and one assuming large\nnumbers of light bodies (Goldreich et al 2002). We argue that both assumptions\nare unwarranted, and we show how TNO binaries can be produced from a modest\nnumber of intermediate-mass bodies of the type predicted by the gravitational\ninstability theory for the formation of planetesimals (Goldreich and Ward\n1973). We start with a TNO binary population similar to the asteroid binary\npopulation, but subsequently modified by three-body exchange reactions, a\nprocess that is far more efficient in the Kuiper belt, because of the much\nsmaller tidal perturbations by the Sun. Our mechanism can naturally account for\nall four characteristics that distinguish TNO binaries from main-belt asteroid\nbinaries.",

The spectra obtained show double-peaked, extremely wide emission line\nprofiles, and a decrease of the radial velocities with distance to the source\nin a step-like fashion.

We compare two versions of\nnon-relativistic chiral effective field theory: One scheme restricted to pion\nand nucleon degrees of freedom only, and an alternative approach which\nincorporates explicit Delta(1230) resonance degrees of freedom. It turns out\nthat, in order to approach the physical value of g_A in a leading-one-loop\ncalculation, the inclusion of the explicit Delta(1230) degrees of freedom is\ncrucial. With information on important higher order couplings constrained from\nanalyses of inelastic pion production processes, a chiral extrapolation\nfunction for g_A is obtained, which works well from the chiral limit across the\nphysical point into the region of present lattice data. The resulting\nenhancement of our extrapolation function near the physical pion mass is found\nto arise from an interplay between long- and short- distance physics.",

The far-IR spectra are dominated by the strong continuum emission of\ndust and by the fine structure lines of high excitation potential ions (NII,\nNIII and OIII) and those of neutral or weakly ionized atoms (OI and CII). The\nline emission has revealed a very extended component of ionized gas. The study\nof the NIII 57 microns/NII 122 microns and OIII 52/88 microns line intensity\nratios show that the ionized gas has a density of n_e~10^{2-3} cm^-3 while the\nionizing radiation can be characterized by a diluted but hard continuum, with\neffective temperatures of ~35000 K.\n  Photoionization models show that the total number of Lyman photons needed to\nexplain such an extended component is approximately equal to that of the HII\nregions in Sgr B2(N) and (M) condensations. We propose that the inhomogeneous\nand clumpy structure of the cloud allows the radiation to reach large distances\nthrough the envelope. Therefore, photodissociation regions (PDRs) can be\nnumerous at the interface of the ionized and the neutral gas. The analysis of\nthe OI (63 and 145 microns) and CII (158 microns) lines indicates an incident\nfar-UV field (G_0, in units of the local interstellar radiation field) of\n10^{3-4} and a H density of 10^{3-4} cm^{-3} in such PDRs.

The average\ncontribution to the field intensity from the resonances that are above a\nthreshold transmission coefficient $T_{c}$ is a broad distribution with a large\nmaximum at/near mid-waveguide, depending universally (for given $T_{c}$) on the\nratio of the length of the disorder segment to the localization length,\n$L/\\xi$.

We predict galaxy luminosity functions in preheated\nuniverses. The results depend crucially on whether the baryonic smoothing scale\nin the IGM is computed globally, or in a local, density-dependent fashion.\nUsing a globally averaged smoothing scale, we find that models with excessive\npreheating produce too few L_* and fainter galaxies, and are therefore\ninconsistent with observational data. A density-dependent smoothing scale\nrequires more energetic preheating to achieve the same degree of suppression in\nthe faint-end slope. All models, however, appear unable to explain the sharp\ncut-off in the luminosity function at bright magnitudes. Supernova-driven\npreheating scenarios tend to raise the mean metallicity of the universe well\nabove the minimum levels observed in the Lyman-alpha clouds.

For\npointed spaces, the general idea is to decompose the total space of a fibration\nas a diagram over the category of simplices of the base and replace it by the\nlocalized diagram. This of course is not possible in an arbitrary category. We\nhave thus to adapt another construction which heavily depends on Mather's cube\ntheorem. Working with model categories in which the cube theorem holds, we\ncharacterize completely those who admit a fibrewise nullification. As an\napplication we get fibrewise plus-construction and fibrewise Postnikov sections\nfor algebras over an operad.",

From the results of our analysis we conclude that the data confirm the\nend-point suppressed shape of the pion DA we previously obtained with QCD sum\nrules and nonlocal condensates, while the exclusion of both the asymptotic and\nthe Chernyak--Zhitnitsky DAs is reinforced at the $3\\sigma$- and\n$4\\sigma$-level, respectively.

Furthermore,\nwe analyze the relation between the power-law correlations and the origin of\nthe power-law probability distribution of the signal intensity. We introduce a\nstochastic multiplicative model for the time intervals between point events and\nanalyze the statistical properties of the signal analytically and numerically.\nSuch model system exhibits power-law spectral density S(f)~1/f**beta for\nvarious values of beta, including beta=1/2, 1 and 3/2. Explicit expressions for\nthe power spectra in the low frequency limit and for the distribution density\nof the interevent time are obtained. The counting statistics of the events is\nanalyzed analytically and numerically, as well. The specific interest of our\nanalysis is related with the financial markets, where long-range correlations\nof price fluctuations largely depend on the number of transactions. We analyze\nthe spectral density and counting statistics of the number of transactions. The\nmodel reproduces spectral properties of the real markets and explains the\nmechanism of power-law distribution of trading activity.

    "summary": "We study polymer layers formed by irreversible adsorption from a polymer\nmelt. Our theory describes an experiment which is a ``slow'' version of that\nproposed by Guiselin [Europhys. Lett., v. 17 (1992) p. 225] who considered\ninstantaneously irreversibly adsorbing chains and predicted a universal density\nprofile of the layer after swelling with solvent to produce the ``Guiselin\nbrush.'' Here we ask what happens when adsorption is not instantaneous. The\nclassic example is chemisorption. In this case the brush is formed slowly and\nthe final structure depends on the experiment's duration, $t_{final}$. We find\nthe swollen layer consists of an inner region of thickness $z^* \\sim\nt_{final}^{-5/3}$ with approximately constant density and an outer region\nextending up to height $h \\sim N^{5/6}$ which has the same density decay $\\sim\nz^{-2/5}$ as for the Guiselin case.",

    "summary": "The temperature anisotropy power spectrum measured with the Wilkinson\nMicrowave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) at high multipoles is in spectacular\nagreement with an inflationary Lambda-dominated cold dark matter cosmology.\nHowever, the low order multipoles (especially the quadrupole) have lower\namplitudes than expected from this cosmology, indicating a need for new\nphysics. Here we speculate that the low quadrupole amplitude is associated with\nspatial curvature. We show that positively curved models are consistent with\nthe WMAP data and that the quadrupole amplitude can be reproduced if the\nprimordial spectrum truncates on scales comparable to the curvature scale.",

We find that there is always a drag around\nthe laser beam. Though the beam passes through the surface of the cloud and the\nsound velocity is small in the Painlev\\'e boundary layer, the shedding of\nvortices starts only when a threshold velocity is reached. This critical\nvelocity is lower than the critical velocity computed for the corresponding 2D\nproblem at the center of the cloud.

It appears to\ncomprise two components separated by less than 1\" on the sky (<8kpc); one\ncomponent (B) is blue, the other (P) is red in restframe UV-optical colours.\nThe combined system has an optical luminosity of ~8L* and its restframe optical\nspectrum is characteristic of a Seyfert AGN. However, its restframe UV spectrum\nexhibits striking features associated with young stars, including P-Cygni lines\nfrom stellar winds and blue-shifted interstellar absorption lines indicative of\na galactic outflow. Redshifts are derived from stellar photospheric lines in\nthe UV and from narrow emission lines in the restframe optical, and these are\ncompared to that measured for the molecular gas recently detected with the IRAM\ninterferometer. The offsets indicate that the far-IR emission is most likely\nassociated with the near-IR source P, which hosts the Seyfert nucleus, while\nthe UV-bright component B is blueshifted by 400km/s. This suggests that the two\ncomponents are probably merging and the resulting gravitational interactions\nhave triggered the hyperluminous activity. Modelling of the UV spectral\nfeatures implies that the starburst within the UV component of this system has\nbeen going on for at least ~10Myrs. Assuming that the bolometrically-dominant\nobscured component has a similar lifetime, we estimate that it has so far\nformed a total stellar mass of ~10^11 Mo. If this star formation continues at\nits present level for substantially longer, or if this activity is repeated,\nthen the present-day descendant of N2 850.4 will be a very luminous galaxy.",

Previous theoretical work has suggested that a\nbar in a galaxy could be dissolved by the formation of a mass concentration in\nthe center, although the precise mass and degree of central concentration\nrequired is not well-established. Here we report an extensive study of the\neffects of central masses on bars in high-quality N-body simulations of\ngalaxies. We study models containing both strong and weak bars, and quantify\nthe change in bar amplitude as a mass concentration is grown in their centers.\nWe find that bars are more robust than previously thought. We have varied the\ngrowth rate of the central mass, its final mass and the degree of concentration\nof the mass. Our main conclusions are: (1) the central mass has to be as large\nas several percent of the disk mass to completely destroy the bar; (2) for a\ngiven mass, objects whose scale-length is a few pc or less cause the greatest\nreduction in bar amplitude, while significantly more diffuse objects have a\nlesser effect; and (3) the bar amplitude always decreases as the central mass\nis grown, and continues to decay thereafter on a cosmological timescale. Thus\nthe masses of SBHs are probably too small, even when dressed with a stellar\ncusp, to affect the bar amplitude significantly.",

    "summary": "There is quite a clear anticorrelation between the intrinsic peak frequency\nand the overall radio source size in Compact Steep Spectrum (CSS) and GHz\nPeaked Spectrum (GPS) radio sources as shown by O'Dea (1998). This feature is\ninterpreted in terms of synchrotron self-absorption (although free-free\nabsorption may play a role as well) of the radiation emitted by a small radio\nsource which is growing within the inner region of the host galaxy. This leads\nto the hypothesis that these objects are young and that the radio source is\nstill developing/expanding within the host galaxy itself. Very young radio\nsources must have the peak in their radio spectra occurring above a few tens of\nGHz, and for this reason they are termed High Frequency Peakers (HFPs). These\nnewly born radio sources must be very rare given that they spend very little\ntime in this stage.",

Exploiting known results of an effective field theory\nwhich separates hard (order 2 pi T) and soft (order gT) contributions, we\nexplore the accuracy of simple resummations which at a given loop order\nsystematically treat hard contributions strictly perturbatively, but soft\ncontributions without truncations. This turns out to improve significantly the\ntwo-loop and the three-loop results in that both remain below the ideal-gas\nvalue, and the degree of renormalization scale dependence decreases as one goes\nfrom two to three loop order, whereas it increases in the conventional\nperturbative results. Including the four-loop logarithms recently obtained by\nKajantie et al., we find that this trend continues and that with a particular\nsublogarithmic constant the untruncated four-loop result is close to the\nthree-loop result, which itself agrees well with available lattice results down\nto temperatures of about 2.5 T_c. We also investigate the possibility of\noptimization by using a variational (``screened'') perturbation theory in the\neffective theory. At two loops, this gives a result below the ideal gas value,\nand also closer to lattice results than the recent two-loop\nhard-thermal-loop-screened result of Andersen et al. While at three-loop order\nthe gap equation of dimensionally reduced screened perturbation theory does not\nhave a solution in QCD, this is remedied upon inclusion of the four-loop\nlogarithms.",

In Einstein-Hilbert gravity, this would include any homogeneous plane\nwave satisfying the weak null energy condition. For conformally flat plane\nwaves such as the Penrose limit of $AdS_5 \\times S^5$, all spacelike curves\nthat reach infinity also end on this boundary and the completion is Hausdorff.\nHowever, the more generic case (including, e.g., the Penrose limits of $AdS_4\n\\times S^7$ and $AdS_7 \\times S^4$) is more complicated. In one natural\ntopology, not all spacelike curves have limit points in the causal completion,\nindicating the need to introduce additional points at `spacelike infinity'--the\nendpoints of spacelike curves. We classify the distinct ways in which spacelike\ncurves can approach infinity, finding a {\\it two}-dimensional set of distinct\nlimits. The dimensionality of the set of points at spacelike infinity is not,\nhowever, fixed from this argument. In an alternative topology, the causal\ncompletion is already compact, but the completion is non-Hausdorff.",

Our construction is based on structures introduced by\nGeroch, Kronheimer, and Penrose and has much in common with the modifications\nintroduced by Budic and Sachs as well as those introduced by Szabados. However,\nthese earlier constructions defined ideal points as equivalence classes of\ncertain past and future sets, effectively defining the completed space as a\nquotient. Our approach is fundamentally different as it identifies ideal points\ndirectly as appropriate pairs consisting of a (perhaps empty) future set and a\n(perhaps empty) past set. These future and past sets are just the future and\npast of the ideal point within the original spacetime. This provides our\nconstruction with useful causal properties and leads to more satisfactory\nresults in a number of examples. We are also able to endow the completion with\na topology. In fact, we introduce two topologies, which illustrate different\nfeatures of the causal approach. In both topologies, the completion is the\noriginal spacetime together with endpoints for all timelike curves. We explore\nthis procedure in several examples, and in particular for plane wave solutions,\nwith satisfactory results.",

First, barchans receive a sand flux at their back proportional to\ntheir width while the sand escapes only from their horns. Large dunes\nproportionally capture more than they loose sand, while the situation is\nreversed for small ones: therefore, solitary dunes cannot remain in a steady\nstate. Second, the propagation speed of dunes decreases with the size of the\ndune: this leads -- through the collision process -- to a coarsening of barchan\nfields. We show that these phenomena are not specific to the model, but result\nfrom general and robust mechanisms. The length scales needed for these\ninstabilities to develop are derived and discussed. They turn out to be much\nsmaller than the dune field length. As a conclusion, there should exist further\n- yet unknown - mechanisms regulating and selecting the size of dunes.",

In this paper we firstly compare\nanalytically two filters for the PLANCK point source extraction, namely, the\nadaptive top-hat filter (ATHF), the theoretically-optimal filter (TOF). Our\nanalyses are based on the premise that the experiment parameters the TOF assume\nand require are already known: the CMB and noise power spectrum and a circular\nGaussian beam shape and size, whereas the ATHF does not need any a priori\nknowledge. The analyses show that the TOF is optimal in terms of the gain after\nthe parameter inputs. We simulate the PLANCK HFI 100 GHz channel with\nelliptical beam in rotation to test the efficiency of the TOF and the ATHF. We\nalso apply the ATHF on the WMAP Q-band map and the derived map (the\nforeground-cleaned map by Tegmark, de Oliveira Costa & Hamilton) from the WMAP\n1-year data. The uncertainties on the angular power spectrum will hamper the\nefficiency of the TOF. To tackle the real situations for the PLANCK point\nsource extraction, most importantly, the elliptical beam shape with slow\nprecession and change of the ellipticity ratio due to possible mirror\ndegradation effect, the ATHF is computationally efficient and well suited for\nthe construction of the PLANCK Early Release Compact Source Catalogue.",

This appears to question both standard\naccretion disc theory and the zero torque assumption for the inner boundary\ncondition, both of which predict a much less extreme profile. Instead it argues\nthat a torque may be present due to magnetic coupling with matter in the\nplunging region or even to the spinning black hole itself. Discussion so far\nhas centered on the torque acting on the disc. However the crucial determinant\nof the iron line profile is the radial variation of the power radiated in the\ncorona. Here we study the effects of different inner boundary conditions on the\ncoronal emissivity and on the profiles of the observable Fe K alpha lines. We\nargue that in the extreme case where a prominent highly redshifted component of\nthe iron line is detected, requiring a steep emissivity profile in the\ninnermost part and a flatter one outside, energy from the gas plunging into the\nblack hole is being fed directly to the corona.",

The circular polarization appears to be\nmodulated on the primary's spin period and harmonics of the positive superhump\nperiod, with an amplitude peak-to-peak of almost ~10 per cent with both\nnegative and positive polarization. A recent study by Woudt & Warner of RR Cha\nshows it to have both positive and negative superhumps, indicating the presence\nof a precessing/tilted accretion disc. In addition, they also find a stable\nperiod at 1950 s, characteristic of an Intermediate Polar. RR Cha also shows\ndeep eclipses with variable depth. We propose a possible explanation for the\norigin of the polarized emission. We assume that it is of cyclotron origin. The\nvariations of the circular polarization with the proposed spin period are\ncaused by the rotation of the compact object. The long period variability arise\nas a result of a precessing/tilted accretion disc, periodically obscuring\neither of two accretion regions on the surface of the white dwarf. We also\npoint out several similarities of RR Cha with the SW Sex stars. The lack of a\ntime resolved spectroscopic study prevents to make any conclusion regarding its\npossible SW Sex nature.

The basic quantity in this\napproach -- the unintegrated gluon structure function -- was for the first time\nextracted from the experimental data on F_{2p}, thoroughly investigated, and\nconsistently used in the vector meson production calculation. Moreover, by\nlimiting ourselves to the lowest Fock state of the vector meson, we were able\nto construct in a closed form the theory of spin-angular coupling in the vector\nmeson. This allowed us for the first time to address the production of a vector\nmeson in a given spin-angular state. We performed an extensive analytical and\nnumerical investigation of the properties of 1S, 2S, and D-wave vector meson\nproduction reactions. Treating the physical ground state vector mesons as\npurely 1S states, we observed a good overall agreement with all available\nexperimental data on vector meson production. For the excited states, our\nanalysis predicts a picture which is remarkably different from 1S-state, so\nthat such reactions can be regarded as potential sources of new information on\nthe structure of excited states in vector mesons.",

Both for\nensembles and individual orbits, as N increases there is a smooth convergence\ntowards a continuum limit. Discreteness effects are well modeled by Gaussian\nwhite noise with relaxation time t_R = const * (N/log L)t_D, with L the Coulomb\nlogarithm and t_D the dynamical time scale. Discreteness effects accelerate\nemittance growth for initially localised clumps. However, even allowing for\ndiscreteness effects one can distinguish between orbits which, in the continuum\nlimit, feel a regular potential, so that emittance grows as a power law in\ntime, and chaotic orbits, where emittance grows exponentially. For sufficiently\nlarge N, one can distinguish two different `kinds' of chaos. Short range\nmicrochaos, associated with close encounters between charges, is a generic\nfeature, yielding large positive Lyapunov exponents X_N which do not decrease\nwith increasing N even if the bulk potential is integrable. Alternatively,\nthere is the possibility of larger scale macrochaos, characterised by smaller\nLyapunov exponents X_S, which is present only if the bulk potential is chaotic.\nConventional computations of Lyapunov exponents probe X_N, leading to the\noxymoronic conclusion that N-body orbits which look nearly regular and have\nsharply peaked Fourier spectra are `very chaotic.' However, the `range' of the\nmicrochaos, set by the typical interparticle spacing, decreases as N increases,\nso that, for large N, this microchaos, albeit very strong, is largely\nirrelevant macroscopically. A more careful numerical analysis allows one to\nestimate both X_N and X_S.",

To circumvent this problem we need to\nspecify a gauge condition to fix the gauge so that the fields that are\nconnected by gauge invariance are not overcounted in the process of\nquantization. The usual way we do this in the light-front is through the\nintroduction of a Lagrange multiplier, $(n\\cdot A)^{2}$, where $n_{\\mu}$ is the\nexternal light-like vector, i.e., $n^{2}=0$, and $A_{\\mu}$ is the vector\npotential. This leads to the usual light-front propagator with all the ensuing\ncharacteristics such as the prominent $(k\\cdot n)^{-1}$ pole which has been the\nsubject of much research. However, it has been for long recognized that this\nprocedure is incomplete in that there remains a residual gauge freedom still to\nbe fixed by some ``ad hoc'' prescription, and this is normally worked out to\nremedy some unwieldy aspect that emerges along the way. In this work we propose\na new Lagrange multiplier for the light-front gauge that leads to the correctly\ndefined propagator with no residual gauge freedom left. This is accomplished\nvia $(n\\cdot A)(\\partial \\cdot A)$ term in the Lagrangian density. This leads\nto a well-defined and exact though Lorentz non invariant propagator.",

In particular it is shown that, when the temperature\ndecreases, the compound exhibits a crossover from 2D-Heisenberg to 2D-Ising\nbehavior, followed by a 2D-Ising-like phase transition, whose location allows\nto get a reliable estimate of the easy-axis anisotropy driving the transition\nitself. Below the critical temperature T_N=3.77 K, the specific heat is well\ndescribed by the two-dimensional easy-axis model down to a temperature T*=1.47\nK where a T^3-law sets in, possibly marking a low-temperature crossover of\nmagnetic fluctuations from two to three dimensions.",

We show that Fe is present above the photosphere as\nlong as $\\dot M>4\\times 10^{-13}M_\\odot {\\rm yr^{-1}}$ during the burst. In\nthis limit, the total Fe column is $N_{\\rm Fe}\\approx 3\\times 10^{19}{\\rm\ncm^{-2}}$ for incident material of solar abundances and only depends on the\nnuclear physics of the proton spallation. The Fe destruction creates many heavy\nelements with $Z<26$ which may imprint photo-ionization edges on the NS spectra\nduring a radius expansion event or in a burst cooling tail. Detecting these\nfeatures in concert with those from Fe would confirm a redshift measurement. We\nalso begin to address the radiative transfer problem, and find that a\nconcentrated Fe layer with $kT=1.2-1.4 {\\rm keV}$ and column $N_{\\rm Fe}= 7-20\n\\times 10^{20} {\\rm cm}^{-2}$ (depending on the line depth) above the hotter\ncontinuum photosphere is required to create the H$\\alpha$ line of the observed\nstrength. This estimate must be refined by considerations of non-LTE effects as\nwell as resonant line transport. Until these are carried out, we cannot say\nwhether the Fe column from accretion and spallation is in conflict with the\nobservations. We also show that hydrogenic Fe might remain in the photosphere\ndue to radiative levitation from the high burst flux.",

Making use of the fact\nthat an isotropic image could be reconstructed from its projection into any\ndirection, we can reconstruct the images of the X-ray halos from the data\nobtained with the HETGS and/or in CC mode. These data have no or less serious\npile-up and enable us to take full advantage of the excellent angular\nresolution of Chandra. With the reconstructed high resolution images, we can\nprobe the X-ray halos as close as 1$''$ to their associated point sources.\nApplying this method to Cygnus X-1 observed with Chandra HETGS in CC mode, we\nderived an energy dependent radial halo flux distribution and concluded that,\nin a circular region (2$'$ in radius) centered at the point source: (1)\nrelative to the total intensity, the fractional halo intensity (FHI) is about\n15% at $\\sim$1 keV and drops to about 5% at $\\sim$6 keV; (2) about 50% of the\nhalo photons are within the region of a radius less than 40$''$; and (3) the\nspectrum of the point source is slightly distorted by the halo contamination.",

Two of the observed fields have been studied at multiple\nfrequencies, allowing determination of power spectra and structure functions of\nrotation measure RM as well. The third field extends over a large part of the\nnorthern sky, so that the variation of the power spectra over Galactic latitude\nand longitude can be studied. The power spectra of Q and U are steeper than\nthose of P, probably because a foreground Faraday screen creates extra\nstructure in Q and U, but not in P. The extra structure in Q and U occurs on\nlarge scales, and therefore causes a steeper spectrum. The derived slope of the\npower spectrum of P is the multipole spectral index, and is consistent with\nearlier estimates. The multipole spectral index decreases with Galactic\nlatitude (i.e. the spectrum becomes flatter), but is consistent with a constant\nvalue over Galactic longitude. Power spectra of the rotation measure RM show a\nspectral index of about 1, while the structure function of RM is approximately\nflat. The structure function is flatter than earlier estimates from polarized\nextragalactic sources, which could be due to the fact that extragalactic source\nRM probes the complete line of sight through the Galaxy, whereas as a result of\ndepolarization diffuse radio polarization only probes the nearby ISM.",

    "summary": "We study aspects of the interaction between a D-brane and an anti-D-brane in\nthe maximally supersymmetric plane wave background of type IIB superstring\ntheory, which is equipped with a mass parameter mu. An early such study in flat\nspacetime (mu=0) served to sharpen intuition about D-brane interactions,\nshowing in particular the key role of the ``stringy halo'' that surrounds a\nD-brane. The halo marks the edge of the region within which tachyon\ncondensation occurs, opening a gateway to new non-trivial vacua of the theory.\nIt seems pertinent to study the fate of the halo for non--zero mu. We focus on\nthe simplest cases of a Lorentzian brane with p=1 and an Euclidean brane with\np=-1, the D--instanton. For the Lorentzian brane, we observe that the halo is\nunaffected by the presence of non--zero mu. This most likely extends to other\n(Lorentzian) p. For the Euclidean brane, we find that the halo is affected by\nnon-zero mu. As this is related to subtleties in defining the exchange\namplitude between Euclidean branes in the open string sector, we expect this to\nextend to all Euclidean branes in this background.",

Yamada gave a construction of a symmetric spin model on $4n$ vertices\nfrom each 4-weight spin model on $n$ vertices.\n  In this paper we build on recent work with Munemasa to give a different proof\nto Yamada's result, and we analyse the structure of the association scheme\nattached to this spin model.",

Our resistivity\nmeasurements indicate that the compound Yb$_2$Ir$_3$Ge$_5$ behaves like a\ntypical Kondo lattice system with no ordering down to 0.4 K. However, a\nCurie-Weiss fit of the inverse magnetic susceptibility above 100 K gives an\neffective moment of only 3.66 $\\mu$$_B$ which is considerably less than the\ntheoretical value of 4.54 $\\mu$$_B$ for magnetic Yb$^3+$ ions. The value of\n$\\theta_{P}$ = -15.19 K is also considerably higher indicating the presence of\nstrong hybridization. An upturn in the low temperature heat capacity gives an\nindication that the system may order magnetically just below the lowest\ntemperature of our heat capacity measurements (0.4 K).

The technical challenges to this end can be\nsummarized as building a very large TPC capable of detecting low energy\nrecoils, down to a few 100 eV, within the required low background constraints.\nMore specifically We propose the development of a spherical gaseous TPC of\nabout 10-m in radius and a 200 Mcurie triton source in the center of curvature.\nOne can list a number of exciting studies, concerning fundamental physics\nissues, that could be made using a large volume TPC and low energy\nantineutrinos:1) The oscillation length involving the small mixing angle in the\nelectronic neutrino disappearancei experiment is comparable to the length of\nthe detector. Measuring the counting rate of neutrino-electron elastic\nscattering will give a precise measurement of the oscillation parameters free\nof systematic errors. First estimations show that a sensitivity of a few\npercent for the measurement of the above angle. 2) The low energy detection\nthreshold offers a unique sensitivity for the neutrino magnetic moment which is\nabout two orders of magnitude beyond the current experimental limit. 3)\nScattering at such low neutrino energies has never been studied and any\ndeparture from the expected behavior may be an indication of new physics beyond\nthe standard model. We present results of theoretical calculation and studies\nof possible measurements.",

We review the ideas of computational mechanics, an\ninformation-theoretic method for finding optimal causal models of stochastic\nprocesses, and argue that macrostates coincide with the ``causal states'' of\ncomputational mechanics. Defining a set of macrostates thus consists of an\ninductive process where we start with a given set of observables, and then\nrefine our partition of phase space until we reach a set of states which\npredict their own future, i.e. which are Markovian.

    "summary": "It was generally believed that, in general relativity, the fundamental laws\nof nature should be invariant or covariant under a general coordinate\ntransformation. In general relativity, the equivalence principle tells us the\nexistence of a local inertial coordinate system and the fundamental laws in the\nlocal inertial coordinate system which are the same as those in inertial\nreference system. Then, after a general coordinate transformation, the\nfundamental laws of nature in arbitrary coordinate system or in arbitrary\ncurved space-time can be obtained. However, through a simple example, we find\nthat, under a general coordinate transformation, basic physical equations in\ngeneral relativity do not transform covariantly, especially they do not\npreserve their forms under the transformation from a local inertial coordinate\nsystem to a curved space-time. The origination of the violation of the general\ncovariance is then studied, and a general theory on general coordinate\ntransformations is developed. Because of the the existence of the\nnon-homogeneous term, the fundamental laws of nature in arbitrary curved\nspace-time can not be expressed by space-time metric, physical observable and\ntheir derivatives. In other words, basic physical equations obtained from the\nequivalence principle and the principle of general covariance are different\nfrom those in general relativity. Both the equivalence principle and the\nprinciple of general covariance can not be treated as foundations of general\nrelativity. So, what are the foundations of General Relativity? Such kind of\nessential problems on General Relativity can be avoided in the physical picture\nof gravity. Quantum gauge theory of gravity, which is founded in the physics\npicture of gravity, does not have such kind of fundamental problems.",

We find that the spatial distribution of the local power of the\ntransmitted flux on scales k >= 0.05 s/km is highly spiky or intermittent. The\nprobability distribution functions (PDFs) of the local power are long-tailed.\nThe power on small scales is dominated by small probability events, and\nconsequently, the uncertainty in the power spectrum of the transmitted flux\nfield is generally large. This uncertainty arises due to the slow convergence\nof an intermittent field to a Gaussian limit required by the central limit\ntheorem (CLT). To reduce this uncertainty, it is common to estimate the error\nof the power spectrum by selecting subsamples with an \"optimal\" size. We show\nthat this conventional method actually does not calculate the variance of the\noriginal intermittent field but of a Gaussian field. Based on the analysis of\nintermittency, we propose an algorithm to calculate the error. It is based on a\nbootstrap re-sampling among all independent local power modes. This estimation\ndoesn't require any extra parameter like the size of the subsamples, and is\nsensitive to the intermittency of the fields. This method effectively reduces\nthe uncertainty in the power spectrum when the number of independent modes\nmatches the condition of the CLT convergence.",

The typical frequency $\\nu_m$ of the\nsynchrotron emission from the forward shock passes through the optical band\ntypically on a timescale of minutes to hours. Before the passage of $\\nu_m$,\nthe optical flux evolves as $t^{-1/4}$ and after the passage, the decay\nsteepens to $t^{-(3p-2)/4}$, where $p$ is the exponent for the assumed\npower-law energy distribution of nonthermal electrons and is typically $\\sim\n2$. The steepening in the slope of temporal decay should be readily\nidentifiable in the early afterglow light curves. We propose that such a\nsteepening was observed in the R-band light curve of GRB 021004 around day 0.1.\nAvailable data at several radio frequencies are consistent with this\ninterpretation, as are the X-ray observations around day~1.

    "summary": "Water plays a key role in biological membrane transport. In ion channels and\nwater-conducting pores (aquaporins), one dimensional confinement in conjunction\nwith strong surface effects changes the physical behavior of water. In\nmolecular dynamics simulations of water in short (0.8 nm) hydrophobic pores the\nwater density in the pore fluctuates on a nanosecond time scale. In long\nsimulations (460 ns in total) at pore radii ranging from 0.35 nm to 1.0 nm we\nquantify the kinetics of oscillations between a liquid-filled and a\nvapor-filled pore. This behavior can be explained as capillary evaporation\nalternating with capillary condensation, driven by pressure fluctuations in the\nwater outside the pore. The free energy difference between the two states\ndepends linearly on the radius. The free energy landscape shows how a\nmetastable liquid state gradually develops with increasing radius. For radii\nlarger than ca. 0.55 nm it becomes the globally stable state and the vapor\nstate vanishes. One dimensional confinement affects the dynamic behavior of the\nwater molecules and increases the self diffusion by a factor of two to three\ncompared to bulk water. Permeabilities for the narrow pores are of the same\norder of magnitude as for biological water pores. Water flow is not continuous\nbut occurs in bursts. Our results suggest that simulations aimed at collective\nphenomena such as hydrophobic effects may require simulation times longer than\n50 ns. For water in confined geometries, it is not possible to extrapolate from\nbulk or short time behavior to longer time scales.",

As a\nresult, one can propagate this better-sampled background spectrum through\ninverses of the distortion and rectification transformations, and accurately\nmodel the background spectrum in two-dimensional spectra for which the\ndistortions have not been removed (i.e. the data have not been\nrebinned/rectified). The procedure, as outlined in this paper, is extremely\ninsensitive to cosmic rays, hot pixels, etc. Because of this insensitivity to\ndiscrepant pixels, sky modeling and subtraction need not be performed as one of\nthe later steps in a reduction pipeline. Sky-subtraction can now be performed\nas one of the earliest tasks, perhaps just after dividing by a flat-field.\nBecause subtraction of the background can be performed without having to\n``clean'' cosmic rays, such bad pixel values can be trivially identified after\nremoval of the two-dimensional sky background.",

The e-folding time is ~ 7 ms for the\nmain flare and ~ 1 ms for its precursor. The spectrum strongly hardens during\nthe flare. On the other hand, flares in the hard state have generally lower\namplitudes and longer e-folding times, and their spectra soften during the\nflare, with the hardness of the spectrum at the flare peak similar for both\ntypes of the flares. The presence of the flares shows unusually dramatic events\ntaking place in the accretion flow of Cyg X-1. On the other hand, the rate of\noccurence of hard-state flares shows they may represent a high-flux end of the\ndistribution of shots present in usual lightcurves of Cyg X-1.",

Our novel procedure is to treat the\nwind equation as an algebraic relation between the relativistic Alfv\\'{e}n\nMach-number and the poloidal electric to toroidal magnetic field amplitudes\nratio $\\xi$.\n  This allows us to obtain easily the wind solutions for\ntrans-fast-magnetosonic flows, together with the required range of\n  $\\xi$. Then, to determine the spatial variation of $\\xi$, we solve\napproximately the Grad-Shafranov equation applied to a jet flow ejected with a\nvery large total specific energy $E$ and confined within a very small opening\nangle. Our trans-fast-magnetosonic model provides a closed-form expression for\nthe transition from a magnetically dominated flow to a kinetic-energy dominated\none, which occurs in the sub-asymptotic region far beyond the light cylinder of\nthe radius\n  $R_{\\rm L}$. Importantly, we find that the equipartition between magnetic and\nkinetic energies is realized at a cylindrical radius of order of\n  $R_{\\rm L}E/c^{2}$, and confirm that the further conversion of magnetic to\nkinetic energy proceeds logarithmically with distance in the asymptotic region.\nFinally, we discuss briefly the astrophysical implications of our model for\njets originating from active galactic nuclei.",

    "summary": "A hole in a 4d orbital of atomic xenon relaxes through Auger decay after a\nlifetime of 3 fs. Adding electronegative fluorine ligands to form xenon\nfluoride molecules, results in withdrawal of valence-electron density from Xe.\nThus, within the one-center picture of Auger decay, a lowered Xe 4d Auger width\nwould be expected, in contradiction, however, with experiment. Employing\nextensive ab initio calculations within the framework of many-body Green's\nfunctions, we determine all available decay channels in XeFn and characterize\nthese channels by means of a two-hole population analysis. We derive a relation\nbetween two-hole population numbers and partial Auger widths. On this basis,\ninteratomic electronic decay processes are demonstrated to be so strong in the\nxenon fluorides that they overcompensate the reduction in intra-atomic Auger\nwidth and lead to the experimentally observed trend. The nature of the relevant\nprocesses is discussed. These processes presumably underlie Auger decay in a\nvariety of systems.",

As collapse continues and brings\nin more rapidly rotating gas, the wind can eventually break out. Here we model\nthis transition by following the motion of the shocked shell created by impact\nof the wind and a rotating, collapsing envelope. We first demonstrate, both\nanalytically and numerically, that our previous, quasi-static solutions are\ndynamically unstable. Our present, fully time-dependent calculations include\ncases both where the wind is driven back by infall to the stellar surface, and\nwhere it erupts as a true outflow. For the latter, we find that the time of\nbreakout is sim 50,000 yr for wind speeds of 200 km/s. The reason for the delay\nis that the shocked material, including the swept-up infall, must be able to\nclimb out of the star's gravitational potential well.\n  We explore the critical wind speed necessary for breakout as a function of\nthe mass transport rates in the wind and infall, as well as the cloud rotation\nrate Omega0 and time since the start of infall. Breakout does occur for\nrealistic parameter choices. The actual breakout times would change if we\nrelaxed the assumption of perfect mixing between the wind and infall material.\nOur expanding shells do not exhibit the collimation of observed jets, but\ncontinue to expand laterally. To halt this expansion, the density in the\nenvelope must fall off less steeply than in our model.",

We\nreview the decade long research program to measure the cross section of the\n$^7Be(p,\\gamma)^8B$ reaction using the Coulomb dissociation method, including\nthe pioneering RIKEN1 experiment carried out during March 1992, followed by\nRIKEN2, GSI1, GSI2 and an MSU experiment.

The\nGSI1 and GSI2 high precision measurements are in good (to perfect) agreement\nwith the newly published high precision measurements of direct capture with\n$^7Be$ targets. From these GSI-Seattle-Weizmann high precision data we conclude\nthat the astrophysical cross section factor, $S_{17}(0)$, is most likely in the\nrange of 20 - 22 eV-b. We point out to an additional large uncertainty (-10%\n+3%) that still exists due to uncertainty in the measured slope of the S-factor\nand the theoretical extrapolation procedure which may still lower $S_{17}(0)$\ndown to approximately 18.5 eV-b. For quoting $S_{17}(0)$ with an uncertainty of\n$\\pm$5% or better, yet another measurement needs to be performed at very low\nenergies, as recently discussed by the UConn-Weizmann-LLN collaboration for the\nCERN/ISOLDE facility.",

Despite of its proximity to us (16 Mpc) it\nis not known with certainty whether or not M87 has a dusty torus.\n  Infrared observations indicate that if a torus exists in M87 it must have a\nrather low infrared luminosity. Using arguments from unification theory of\nactive galactic nuclei, we have earlier suggested that the inner parsec-scale\nregion of M87 could still harbour a small torus sufficiently cold such that its\ninfrared emission is dwarfed by the jet emission. The infrared emission from\neven a small cold torus could affect through photon-photon pair production\ninteractions the escape of 100 GeV to TeV energy gamma rays from the central\nparsec of M87.\n  The TeV gamma-ray flux from the inner jet of M87 has recently been predicted\nin the context of the Synchrotron Proton Blazar (SPB) model to extend up to at\nleast 100 GeV (Protheroe, Donea, Reimer, 2002). Subsequently, the detection of\ngamma-rays above 730 GeV by the HEGRA Cherenkov telescopes has been reported.\nWe discuss the interactions of gamma-rays produced in the inner jet of M87 with\nthe weak infrared radiation expected from a possible dusty small-scale torus,\nand show that the HEGRA detection shows that the temperature of any torus\nsurrounding the gamma-ray emission region must be cooler than about 250 K.

We then mention the\nunique role of the boost-rotation symmetric spacetimes, representing uniformly\naccelerated objects, as the only explicit radiative solutions known which are\nasymptotically flat; they are used as test beds in numerical relativity and\napproximation methods.\n  The main part of the review is devoted to the examples of radiative fields in\nthe vacuum spacetimes with positive cosmological constant. Type N solutions are\nanalyzed by using the equation of geodesic deviation. Both these and\nRobinson-Trautman solutions of type II are shown to approach de Sitter universe\nasymptotically. Recent work on the the radiative fields due to uniformly\naccelerated charges in de Sitter spacetime (\"cosmological Born's solutions\") is\nreviewed and the properties of these fields are discussed with a perspective to\ncharacterize general features of radiative fields near a de Sitter-like\ninfinity.",

In this paper we\nuse these distribution functions to populate dark matter haloes in\nhigh-resolution N-body simulations of the standard LCDM cosmogony with\nOmega_m=0.3 and sigma_8=0.9. Stacking simulation boxes of 100 Mpc/h and 300\nMpc/h with 512^3 CDM particles each we construct Mock Galaxy Redshift Surveys\nout to a redshift of z=0.2. We use these mock surveys to investigate various\nclustering statistics. The projected correlation functions for galaxies with\ndifferent luminosities and types match the observations well on scales larger\nthan about 3 Mpc/h. On smaller scales, however, the model overpredicts the\nclustering power by about a factor two. Furthermore, the model predicts\npairwise velocity dispersions (PVD) that are about 400 km/s too high at\nprojected pair separations of ~1 Mpc/h. A strong velocity bias in massive\nhaloes can reduce the predicted PVD to the observed level, but does not help to\nresolve the over-prediction of clustering power on small scales. Consistent\nresults can be obtained within the standard LCDM model only when the\nmass-to-light ratio of clusters is almost twice the observed value.\nAlternatively, a LCDM model with sigma_8=0.75 can also reproduce the\nobservational results.",

For the sake of simplicity the temperature is considered\nuniform. The goal of the paper is to examine the validity of the linear\napproximation. With this purpose the evolution equations are developed\nincluding quadratic terms in the derivatives of the metric perturbations and\nusing coordinate conditions that, in the linear case, reduce to the\nlongitudinal gauge. We obtain the general solution, in the coordinate space, of\nthe evolution equation for the scalar mode, and, in the case of spherical\nsymmetry, we express this solution in terms of unidimensional integrals of the\ninitial conditions: the initial values of the Newtonian potential and its first\ntime derivative. We find that the contribution of the initial first time\nderivative, which has been systematically forgotten, allows to form\ninhomogeneities similar to a cluster of galaxies starting with very small\ndensity contrast. Finally, we obtain the first non linear correction to the\nlinearized solution due to the quadratic terms in the evolution equations. Here\nwe find that a non null pressure plays a crucial role in constraining the non\nlinear corrections. It is shown, by means of examples, that reasonable thermal\nvelocities at the present epoch (non bigger than $10^{-6}$) make the ratio\nbetween the first non linear correction and the linear solution of the order of\n$10^{-2}$ for a galaxy cluster inhomogeneity.",

Part of it can be attributed\nto stellar activity as we demonstrate by correlating the residual RVs with an\nindex that describes the filling-in of the Halpha line by emission. A\ncorrelation coefficient of -0.50 indicates that the appearance of active\nregions causes a blueshift of photospheric absorption lines. Assuming that\nactive regions basically inhibit convection we discuss the possibility that the\nfundamental (inactive) convection pattern in this M4V star produces a\nconvective redshift. We also determine upper limits to the projected mass msini\nand to the true mass m of hypothetical planetary companions in circular orbits.\nFor the separation range 0.017-0.98 AU we exclude any planet with msini>0.12\nMjupiter and m>0.86 Mjupiter. Throughout the habitable zone, i.e. 0.034-0.082\nAU, we exclude planets with msini>7.5 Mearth and m>3.1 Mneptune.",

Annual\nlayered (varved) deposits of a landslide dammed lake in the Santa Maria Basin\n(26 deg S, 66 deg W) with an age of 30,000 14C years provide an archive of\nprecipitation variability during this time. The comparison of these data with\npresent-day rainfall observations tests the hypothesis that increased rainfall\nvariability played a major role in landslide generation. A potential cause of\nsuch variability is the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The causal link\nbetween ENSO and local rainfall is quantified by using a new method of\nnonlinear data analysis, the quantitative analysis of cross recurrence plots\n(CRP). This method seeks similarities in the dynamics of two different\nprocesses, such as an ocean-atmosphere oscillation and local rainfall. Our\nanalysis reveals significant similarities in the statistics of both modern and\npalaeo-precipitation data. The similarities in the data suggest that an\nENSO-like influence on local rainfall was present at around 30,000 14C years\nago. Increased rainfall, which was inferred from a lake balance modeling in a\nprevious study, together with ENSO-like cyclicities could help to explain the\nclustering of landslides at around 30,000 14C years ago.",

On the whole, the models reproduce the properties of\npresent-day spirals (such as SFRs, SFHs, scale sizes, metallicities, and gas\nfractions) rather well. In particular, we find that once the effects of dust\nand variations in stellar populations have been taken into account, published\nspiral galaxy scale-size distributions derived from optical data (with\nlogarithmic widths ~0.3) can be reconciled with the width of the stellar mass\nscale-size distribution predicted by the semi-analytic model (~0.5). There are\nsome illuminating discrepancies between the observations and the model\npredictions. The model colours of luminous spiral galaxies are somewhat too\nblue and those of faint galaxies somewhat too red, most likely indicating\nshortcomings in the way that gas is accreted by spiral galaxies. Furthermore,\nthe model produces too few luminous spiral galaxies. These difficulties could\nbe resolved by altering the way in which gas cooling is treated or, perhaps, by\nadopting a higher baryon fraction and invoking galactic `superwinds.' Secondly,\nstellar M/Ls are found to be as high as observations permit. Yet, typically 60%\nof the mass in the inner half-light radius of the model galaxies is dark. This\nresults in an offset between the model and observed spiral galaxy\nluminosity-linewidth relation. This could be resolved by substantially reducing\nthe mass of baryons which make it into a galaxy disc (with an attendant\ndecrease in stellar M/L), or by modifying the assumed dark matter profile to\ninclude less dark matter in the inner parts.

Both linear and non-linear growth are studied, together\nwith their observational signatures on higher order statistics and abundance of\ncollapsed objects. In general, models which show similar cosmic acceleration at\nz ~ 1, can produce quite different normalization for large scale density\nfluctuations, ie sigma_8, cluster abundance or higher order statistics, such as\nthe normalized skewness S_3, which is independent of the linear normalization.\nFor example, for a flat universe with Omega_M ~ 0.22, DGP and standard\nCardassian cosmologies predict about 2 and 3 times more clusters respectively\nthan the standard Lambda model at z=1.5. When normalized to CMB fluctuations\nthe sigma_8 amplitude turns out to be lower by a few tens of a percent.

On the part of the hyperbolic\nbranch where the lightest neutralino is dominantly a higgsino rather than being\nmostly a bino, the relic density constraints are satisfied by coannihilation\nwith the next lightest neutralino and the light chargino. Including this branch\nthe lightest neutralino mass satisfies $m_{\\chi_1^0}\\leq 1200$ GeV for\n$\\tan\\beta\\leq 50$. Constraints of $b\\to s+\\gamma$ and of $g_{\\mu}-2$ are also\nanalyzed.

Within the accuracy of the\nexperiment, the sum rule is obeyed in both materials.

The FGT sum rule in the optimally-doped material suggests that the\nmajority of the spectral weight of the condensate comes from energies below\n2\\Delta_0, which is consistent with a BCS material in which the condensate\noriginates from a Fermi liquid normal state.

    "summary": "The short-period cataclysmic variable WZ Sge underwent its first dwarf nova\noutburst in 23 years in 2001 July. Here we describe 905-1187 Ang. spectra\nobtained with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) during the\noutburst and within the first few months after the outburst. The first\nspectrum, obtained about 7 days after the outburst began and 6.4 days past\noptical maximum, is dominated by a broad (50-60 Ang. EW) feature due to O VI\nand can be characterized in terms of emission from a highly inclined disk\nmodulated by the effects of a highly ionized wind. WZ Sge is fainter in later\nobservations (starting about 45 days after optical maximum) and increasingly\n\"red\" in the far ultraviolet. The spectral shape increasingly resembles that\nexpected from a metal-enriched white dwarf photosphere, although it seems\nlikely that some disk contribution remains at least through the second FUSE\nobservation, when the visible light curve showed the system to be undergoing a\nrebrightening event. The absorption lines observed on 29 September and in early\nNovember, when the visible light curve was in a fairly steady decline toward\nquiescence, are narrow, with widths (FWHM) of order 0.7-1.3 Ang. (200-400\nkm/s). The most natural explanation for these spectra is that the continuum\narises from a relatively massive, slowly rotating white dwarf, and that the\nlines are created by a combination of metals in the atmosphere and of absorbing\nmaterial along the line of sight to the white dwarf. If the white dwarf has\nlog{g}= 8.5, then the white dwarf cooled from ~25,000 K on 29 September to\n23,000 K in early November.",

We\nclassify the latter according to their symmetry transformation properties as\nwell as the order at which they appear in a derivative expansion. We apply this\nframework to several particle physics models, including R-parity violating\nsupersymmetry (RPV SUSY) and the left-right symmetric model (LRSM) with mixing\nand a right-handed Majorana neutrino. We show that, in general, the pion\nexchange contributions to $\\nbb$-decay dominate over the short-range\nfour-nucleon operators. This confirms previously published RPV SUSY results and\nallows us to derive new constraints on the masses in the LRSM. In particular,\nwe show how a non-zero mixing angle $\\zeta$ in the left-right symmetry model\nproduces a new potentially dominant contribution to $\\nbb$-decay that\nsubstantially modifies previous limits on the masses of the right-handed\nneutrino and boson stemming from constraints from $\\nbb$-decay and vacuum\nstability requirements.",

The results include standard phases,\nsuch as the CE-insulating and FM-metallic regimes, but they also unveil novel\nstates, such as a ferromagnetic charge-ordered (CO) orbital-ordered phase\ncompatible with recent experimental results by Loudon et al. (ii) For realistic\ncouplings, it was observed that the charge disproportionation delta of the CO\nphase is far from the widely accepted extreme limit delta=0.5 of a 3+/4+ charge\nseparation. A far smaller delta appears more realistic, in agreement with\nrecent experiments by Garcia et al. and Daoud-Aladine it et al. (iii) Colossal\nmagnetoresistance (CMR) effects are found in calculations of cluster\nresistances using the Landauer formalism. This occurs near the ubiquitous\nfirst-order phase transitions between the insulating and metallic states. (iv)\nThe CE-state is found to be (very sensitive to disorder) since its long-range\norder rapidly disappears when quenched-disorder is introduced, contrary to the\nFM state which is more robust. This is also in qualitative agreement with\nrecent experiments by Akahoshi et al. and Nakajima et al. (v) The phase diagram\nin the half-doped (electron doping) regime is briefly discussed as well. A\ncharge-ordered state is found which is the analog of the x=0.5 CE phase. It\ncontains a 3+/2+ charge arrangement at large lambda.",

The model\nplanetary radii are intended for comparisons with radii derived from\nobservations of transiting extrasolar planets. To provide such comparisons, we\nexpect that of order 10 transiting planets with orbital periods less than 200\ndays can be detected around bright (V<10) main-sequence stars for which\naccurate, well-sampled radial velocity measurements can be readily accumulated.\nThrough these observations, structural properties of the planets will be\nderivable, particularly for low-mass, high-temperature planets. Implications\nregarding the transiting companion to OGLE-TR-56 recently announced by Konacki\net al. are discussed.\n  With regard to the confirmed transiting planet, HD 209458b, we find, in\naccordance with other recent calculations, that models without internal heating\npredict a radius that is 35 percent smaller than the observed radius. We\nexplore the possibility that HD 209458b owes its large size to dissipation of\nenergy arising from ongoing tidal circularization of the orbit.

Abundance comparisons show an excellent\nagreement between the heaviest n-capture elements (Z >= 56) and scaled solar\nsystem r-process abundances, confirming earlier results for CS 22892-052 and\nother metal-poor stars. New theoretical r-process calculations also show good\nagreement with CS 22892-052 abundances as well as the solar r-process abundance\ncomponents.The abundances of lighter elements (40<= Z <= 50), however, deviate\nfrom the same scaled abundance curves that match the heavier elements,\nsuggesting different synthesis conditions or sites for the low-mass and\nhigh-mass ends of the abundance distribution.

If the energy spectrum of the configurations has\na low energy tail, the model also allows a thermodynamic liquid-liquid\ntransition at T_l. The liquid-liquid transition of the model is correlated to\nthe kinetic fragile-strong transition accompanied by the anomalous slowing down\nof motion. Fragility of the system is classified in terms of features of the\nenergy landscape such as ruggedness of the potential energy surface, size of\nthe cooperative motion invoked in a transition from one configuration to\nanother, and energy needed to deform the local structure in the cooperative\nmotion. A simple relation is found between diffusion constant, D and the saddle\nindex of the potential energy surface, f, as $D \\propto f^{a}$, where a depends\non the size of the cooperative motion.",

More precisely we count the number of different moments when we\nintroduce an asymmetry (tapping) in the random matrix model and then take it to\nvanish. It is shown here that the number of moments grows exponentially with\nrespect to N the size of the matrix. As these models map onto models of\nstructural glasses in the high temperature phase (liquid) this may have\ninteresting implications for the supercooled liquid phase in these spin glass\nmodels. Further it is shown that the nature of the asymmetry (tapping) is\ncrutial in finding the multiple solutions. This also clarifies some of the\npuzzles we raised in ref. \\cite{bd99}.",

As in the previous\nmodel, the doublet-triplet splitting can be realized in a natural way, while\nproton decay via dimension 5 operators is suppressed and gauge coupling\nunification is also realized without fine-tuning. Combining the matter sector,\nsimple complete GUTs can be obtained. Since the Higgs sector is simpler, the\ngauge coupling constant at the cutoff scale can be in perturbative region, and\ntherefore, the estimated value of the lifetime of a nucleon in this model,\n$\\tau_p(p\\to e^+\\pi^0)\\sim 5\\times 10^{33}$ years, becomes more reliable.",

Although\nthe gauge choice eliminates negative-norm states at the outset, there are still\neven-moded Virasoro and even(odd) moded super-Virasoro constraints to be\nimposed in the NS(R) sectors. The Casimir energy is now positive in both\nsectors; there are no tachyons.

We further found that narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s) also\nfollow this relation with a larger scatter and there is only a weak correlation\nbetween the X-ray variability and the Eddington ratio, which suggest that rapid\nvariability and narrow lines in NLS1s are mainly due to small central black\nholes in NLS1s, not the difference of circumnuclear gas around NLS1s. A strong\ncorrelation was found between the hard X-ray photon index and the Eddington\nratio. If the suggestion of two distinct accretion classes, namely ADAF and\nthin disk accretion, in AGNs (Lu & Yu) is correct, the strong photon\nindex-Eddington ration correlation showed that there exists a kind of two zone\naccretion disk, in which the outer zone is a thin disk, and the inner zone is\nan ADAF disk. Otherwise, the accretion process is the thin disk accretion and\nthe ADAF accretion is not required.",

EE Cep shows very large changes of the shape\nand the depth of minima during different eclipses, however it is possible to\nsingle out some persistent features. The analysis suggests that the eclipsing\nbody should be a long object surrounded by an extended semi-transparent\nenvelope. As an explanation, a model of a precessing optically thick disc,\ninclined to the plane of the binary orbit, is invoked. The changes of its\nspatial orientation, which is defined by the inclination of the disc and the\ntilt, induced most probably by precession of the disc spin axis with a period\nof about 50 years, produce strange photometric behaviour of this star. The\nH_alpha emission, and possibly the NaI absorptions, show significant changes\nduring several months outside of the eclipse phase.",

For 12 of these 37 AGNs, the\nradii of the gravitational instability in the standard thin accretion disks are\nobtained using central black hole masses and the calculated accretion rates.\nThese are consistent with the results from the reverberation mapping method.\nThese results provide supporting evidence that such gravitational instabilities\ncontribute to the formation of the Broad Line Regions (BLRs) in AGNs.",

The 19 binaries brighter than 16.4 mag in I band and\nwith the depth of primary and secondary eclipse greater than 0.25 mag were\ninvestigated. The solutions were obtained by a modified version of the\nWilson-Devinney program. The quality of DIA light curves - a good phase\ncoverage and relatively small scatter - is enough to calculate realistic\nestimates for the third light l_3 and the argument of periastron. It was found\nthat solutions of detached, eccentric systems with flat light curve between\neclipses usually may suffer from indetermination of l_3 in contrast to those of\nsimilar systems having some proximity effects.\n  The physical properties of the stars were estimated on the basis of their\nphotometric elements and indices assuming the distance modulus to SMC ~18.9 and\nconsistency between an empirical mass-luminosity relation and the flux scaling.\nThe method was tested on three LMC stars of known absolute dimensions and a\ngood agreement was found for m-M ~18.5. Such an approach may give fast and\naccurate estimates of absolute dimensions for large and homogeneous samples of\neclipsing binaries in the Magellanic Clouds and other close galaxies. Moreover,\nthis method allows also for independent estimation of E(B-V) in the direction\nto a particular binary.

Specifically, we are interested in what happens when a system\nparameter is slowly swept in time through the bifurcation. Such situations are\nknown to be indeterminate in the sense that it is difficult to predict the\neventual fate of an orbit that tracks the pre-bifurcation node attractor as the\nsystem parameter is swept through the bifurcation. In this paper we investigate\nthe scaling of (1) the fractal basin boundary of the static (i.e., unswept)\nsystem near the saddle-node bifurcation, (2) the dependence of the orbit's\nfinal destination on the sweeping rate, (3) the dependence of the time it takes\nfor an attractor to capture a swept orbit on the sweeping rate, and (4) the\ndependence of the final attractor capture probability on the noise level. With\nrespect to noise, our main result is that the effect of noise scales with the\n5/6 power of the parameter drift rate. Our approach is to first investigate all\nthese issues using one-dimensional map models. The simplification of treatment\ninherent in one dimension greatly facilitates analysis and numerical\nexperiment, aiding us in obtaining the new results listed above. Following our\none-dimensional investigations, we explain that these results can be applied to\ntwo-dimensional systems. We show, through numerical experiments on a\nperiodically forced second order differential equation example, that the\nscalings we have found also apply to systems that result in two dimensional\nmaps.",

We show that due to the Hall effect, strictly speaking there is no\ndistinction between N- and S-shaped CVCs. Instead the observed CVC depends on\nthe experimental setup with, e.g., an N-shaped CVC in a Corbino disc geometry\ncorresponding to an S-shaped CVC in a Hall bar geometry in a strong magnetic\nfield. We argue that instabilities of homogeneous states in regions of negative\ndifferential conductivity lead to the observation of zero resistance in Hall\nbars and zero conductance in Corbino discs and we discuss the structure of\ncurrent and electric field domains.",

From measuring the Doppler shifts of the H-alpha\ncore, we detect velocity changes as large as 16.5 km/s and conclude that they\nare due to the horizontal motions associated with the g-mode pulsations on the\nstar. We detect seven pulsation modes from the velocity time-series and\nidentify the same modes in the flux variations. We discuss the properties of\nthese modes and use the advantage of having both velocity and flux measurements\nof the pulsations to test the convective driving theory proposed for DAV stars.\nOur data show limited agreement with the expected relationships between the\namplitude and phases of the velocity and flux modes. Unexpectedly, the velocity\ncurve shows evidence for harmonic distortion, in the form of a peak in the\nFourier transform whose frequency is the exact sum of the two largest\nfrequencies. Combination frequencies are a characteristic feature of the\nFourier transforms of light curves of G29-38, but before now have not been\ndetected in the velocities, nor does published theory predict that they should\nexist. We compare our velocity combination frequency to combination frequencies\nfound in the analysis of light curves of G29-38, and discuss what might account\nfor the existence of velocity combinations with the properties we observe.\n  We also use our high-resolution spectra to determine if either rotation or\npulsation can explain the truncated shape observed for the DAV star's line\ncore. We are able to eliminate both mechanisms: the average spectrum does not\nfit the rotationally broadened model and the time-series of spectra provides\nproof that the pulsations do not significantly truncate the line.",

    "summary": "In a previous article [H. Bergeron, J. Math. Phys. 42, 3983 (2001)], we\npresented a method to obtain a continuous transition from classical to quantum\nmechanics starting from the usual phase space formulation of classical\nmechanics. This procedure was based on a Koopman-von Neumann approach where\nclassical equations are reformulated into a quantumlike form. In this article,\nwe develop a different derivation of quantum equations, based on purely\nclassical stochastic arguments, taking some elements from the\nBohm-Fenyes-Nelson approach. This study starts from a remark noticed by\ndifferent authors [M. Born, Physics in My Generation (Pergamon Press, London,\n1956); E. Prugovecki, Stochastic Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Spacetime\n(Reidel, Dordrecht, 1986)], suggesting that physical continuous observables are\nstochastic by nature. Following this idea, we study how intrinsic stochastic\nproperties can be introduced into the framework of classical mechanics. Then we\nanalyze how the quantum theory can emerge from this modified classical\nframework. This approach allows us to show that the transition from classical\nto quantum formalism (for a spinless particle) does not require real\npostulates, but rather soft generalizations.",

All of our targets, which span a range of spectral types\nfrom M5 to M8, exhibit moderate to very strong H$\\alpha$ emission. In half of\nthe IC 348 objects, the H$\\alpha$ profiles are broad and asymmetric, indicative\nof on-going accretion. Of these, IC348-355 (M8) is the lowest mass object to\ndate to show accretion-like H$\\alpha$. Three of our ~M6 IC 348 targets with\nbroad H$\\alpha$ also harbor broad OI (8446\\AA) and CaII (8662\\AA) emission, and\none shows broad HeI (6678\\AA) emission; these features are usually seen in\nstrongly accreting classical T Tauri stars. We find that in very low mass\naccretors, the H$\\alpha$ profile may be somewhat narrower than that in higher\nmass stars. We propose that low accretion rates combined with small infall\nvelocities at very low masses can conspire to produce this effect. In the\nnon-accretors in our sample, H$\\alpha$ emission is commensurate with, or higher\nthan, saturated levels in field M dwarfs of similar spectral type. Our results\nconstitute the most compelling evidence to date that young brown dwarfs undergo\na T Tauri-like accretion phase similar to that in stars. This is consistent\nwith a common origin for most low-mass stars, brown dwarfs and isolated\nplanetary mass objects.",

However, this mathematical vector model has barely 200\nyears and its complete installation in the physics is hardly more than 100\nyears old. In classical mechanics, based on point particles with mass, momentum\nis considered as a vector because the speed of the particle is applied on a\nsingle point and the mass is defined only at that point. When the extension to\nclassical rigid solids is made, that is, to solids that keep their shape, being\nso that the speed is defined to be the same for each and every point where the\nsolid is defined, then the viewpoint of momentum as a vector is the simplest\nand more convenient approach. Relativity (restricted and general) was developed\nin the decades of 1900 and 1910 and quantum mechanics in the decades of 1920\nand 1930. Relativity then impedes the existence of classical rigid solids. The\nmaximum speed for the transmission of signals prevents a body from varying its\nstatus without being deformed. On the other hand, quantum physics breaks up\nwith the concept of point particles with mass, substituting this model for the\none of the wave function defined in an extensive region of the space\n(space-time in the quantum relativity). Can we really define, the moment of a\nrelativistic solid or of a wave function with a simple vector?",

One would therefore expect this system to possess a\nsecond constant of the motion in addition to the total energy.

In this paper we\nsolve several problems raised by those authors. The anchored expansion constant\nis a variant of the Cheeger constant; its positivity implies positive lower\nspeed for the simple random walk, as shown by Virag [Geom. Funct. Anal. 10\n(2000) 1588-1605]. We prove that if G has a positive anchored expansion\nconstant, then so does every infinite cluster of independent percolation with\nparameter p sufficiently close to 1; a better estimate for the parameters p\nwhere this holds is in the Appendix. We also show that positivity of the\nanchored expansion constant is preserved under a random stretch if and only if\nthe stretching law has an exponential tail. We then study a simple random walk\nin the infinite percolation cluster in Cayley graphs of certain amenable groups\nknown as ``lamplighter groups.'' We prove that zero speed for a random walk on\na lamplighter group implies zero speed for random walk on an infinite cluster,\nfor any supercritical percolation parameter p. For p large enough, we also\nestablish the converse.",

As\nwell as an elongated envelope associated with the protostellar formation (size\n\\~0.07 pc x 0.04 pc, mass ~ 2.3 Mo), two compact (~ 0.03 pc) condensations were\nfound in the CH3OH line at the southern edge of the elongated envelope, where\nthe blueshifted CO outflow emerging from the protostar is located. In contrast\nto the elongated envelope, those compact CH3OH condensations show much larger\nline width (up to 2.0 km s-1) with centroid velocities blueshifted by ~ 0.8 km\ns-1. The compact condensations have momenta (~ 0.06 Mo km s-1) comparable to\nthat of the blueshifted molecular outflow. These results suggest that the\ncompact condensations are probably formed in the course of interaction between\nthe outflow and the ambient gas surrounding the protostar, and that such\ninteraction may cause dissipation of a part of the ambient gas. No drastic,\nlocalized enhancement of the CH3OH abundance is, however, observed toward the\ncompact condensations, implying that there seems to be no significant shock\nheating at the compact condensations. This may be because the CO outflow\nvelocity (< 10 km s-1) is too low to cause effective heating to release CH3OH\non dust grains into gas phase.",

(2) Tidal scattering of stars on the MBH. (3) Tidal heating of\ninspiraling stars - \"squeezars\" - that were tidally captured by the MBH. We\ndiscuss the implications for stellar populations near MBHs and for the growth\nof MBHs by tidal disruption of stars, and the possible observational signature\nof such processes near the MBH in the Galactic Center. We compare the event\nrates of prompt tidal encounters (tidal disruption and tidal scattering) and\nslow inspiral events (squeezars / tidal capture), and find that tidal capture\nis at least an order of magnitude less efficient than prompt disruption. This\nmeans that past studies, which assigned similar weights to prompt disruption\nand tidal capture, over-estimated the contribution of tidal disruption to the\ngrowth of the MBH by at least a factor of two.",

One is isomorphic to the space of simultaneous deformations of\nthe branch locus and the base of the double covering. The second summand is the\nsubspace of deformations of the double covering which induce trivial\ndeformations of the branch divisor. The main result of the paper is a\ndescription of the effect of imposing singularities in the branch locus.\n  As a special case we study deformations of Calabi--Yau threefolds which are\nnon--singular models of double cover of the projective 3--space branched along\nan octic surface. We show that in that case the number of deformations can be\ncomputed explicitly using computer algebra systems. This gives a method to\ncompute the Hodge numbers of these Calabi--Yau manifolds. In this case the\ntransverse deformations are resolutions of deformations of double covers of\nprojective space but not double covers of a blow--up of projective space. In\nthe paper we gave many explicit examples.",

Quarks and gluons condense to form a gas of nucleons and light mesons,\nthe latter decay subsequently. At the end of the first second, neutrinos and\nneutrons decouple from the radiation fluid. The quark--hadron transition and\ndissipative processes during the first second prepare the initial conditions\nfor the synthesis of the first nuclei.\n  As for the cold dark matter (CDM), WIMPs (weakly interacting massive\nparticles) -- the most popular candidates for the CDM -- decouple from the\npresently known forms of matter, chemically (freeze-out) at 10 ns and\nkinetically at 1 ms.

This description starts from the\n1/N-expansion of the 2PI effective action to next-to-leading order, which\nincludes scattering and memory effects. From this starting point one is lead to\nevolution equations for the propagator, which are nonlocal in time. Numerical\nsolutions showed that the propagator depends only very slightly on the center\ncoordinates already after moderate times, and that correlations between earlier\nand later times are suppressed exponentially, which causes an effective memory\nloss. Exploiting these two observations, we combine a first order gradient\nexpansion with a Wigner transformation to derive our kinetic equations, which\nare local in time, from the nonlocal evolution equations. In contrast to\nstandard descriptions based on loop expansions, our kinetic equations remain\nvalid even for nonperturbatively large fluctuations.

The\nnoise measurements were made using an ac bias with and without a dc bias\ncurrent imposed on it.

The Lorentzian in $S_V(f)$ which appears due\nto Random telegraphic noise (RTN) as seen in the time series of the\nfluctuation, is seen in a very narrow temperature window around $T_{CO}$ where\nit makes the dominating contribution to the fluctuation. When the applied dc\nbias is increased beyond a certain threshold current density $J_{th}$, the\nelectrical conduction becomes non-linear and one sees appearance of a\nsignificant Lorentzian contribution in the spectral power due to RTN.

The AGN phenomenon is commonplace only in galaxies\nwith high mass, high velocity dispersion, and high stellar surface mass\ndensity. Most normal galaxies with these properties have old stellar\npopulations. However, the hosts of powerful AGNs (Seyfert 2s) have young\nstellar populations. The fraction of AGN hosts that have recently undergone a\nmajor starburst also increases with AGN luminosity.

    "summary": "Conventional rockets are not a suitable technology for deep space missions.\nChemical rockets require a very large weight of propellant, travel very slowly\ncompared to light speed, and require significant energy to maintain operation\nover periods of years. For example, the 722 kg Voyager spacecraft required\n13,600 kg of propellant to launch and would take about 80,000 years to reach\nthe nearest star, Proxima Centauri, about 4.3 light years away. There have been\nvarious attempts at developing ideas on which one might base a spacecraft that\nwould permit deep space travel, such as spacewarps. In this paper we consider\nanother suggestion from science fiction and explore how the quantum vacuum\nmight be utilized in the creation of a novel spacecraft. The spacecraft is\nbased on the dynamic Casimir effect, in which electromagnetic radiation is\nemitted when an uncharged mirror is properly accelerated in the vacuum. The\nradiative reaction produces a dissipative force on the mirror that tends to\nresist the acceleration of the mirror. This force can be used to accelerate a\nspacecraft attached to the mirror. We also show that, in principal, one could\nobtain the power to operate the accelerated mirror in such a spacecraft using\nenergy extracted from the quantum vacuum using the standard Casimir effect\nwitha parallel plate geometry. Unfortunately the method as currently conceived\ngenerates a miniscule thrust, and is no more practical than a spacewarp, yet it\ndoes provide an interesting demonstration of our current understanding of the\nphysics of the quantized electromagnetic field in vacuum.",

    "summary": "We present a power spectral analysis of the Crab pulsar's timing noise,\nmainly using radio measurements from Jodrell Bank taken over the period\n1982-1989. The power spectral analysis is complicated by nonuniform data\nsampling and the presence of a steep red power spectrum that can distort power\nspectra measurement by causing severe power ``leakage''. We develop a simple\nwindowing method for computing red noise power spectra of uniformly sampled\ndata sets and test it on Monte Carlo generated sample realizations of red\npower-law noise. We generalize time-domain methods of generating power-law red\nnoise with even integer spectral indices to the case of noninteger spectral\nindices. The Jodrell Bank pulse phase residuals are dense and smooth enough\nthat an interpolation onto a uniform time series is possible. A windowed power\nspectrum is computed revealing a periodic or nearly periodic component with a\nperiod of about 568 days and a 1/f^3 power-law noise component with a noise\nstrength of 1.24 +/- 0.067 10^{-16} cycles^2/sec^2 over the analysis frequency\nrange 0.003 - 0.1 cycles/day. This result deviates from past analyses which\ncharacterized the pulse phase timing residuals as either 1/f^4 power-law noise\nor a quasiperiodic process. The analysis was checked using the Deeter\npolynomial method of power spectrum estimation that was developed for the case\nof nonuniform sampling, but has lower spectral resolution. The timing noise is\nconsistent with a torque noise spectrum rising with analysis frequency as f\nimplying blue torque noise, a result not predicted by current models of pulsar\ntiming noise. If the periodic or nearly periodic component is due to a binary\ncompanion, we find a companion mass > 3.2 Earth masses.",

    "summary": "We propose a new mechanism to generate density perturbations in inflationary\nmodels. Spatial fluctuations in the decay rate of the inflaton field to\nordinary matter lead to fluctuations in the reheating temperature. We argue\nthat in most realistic models of inflation the coupling of the inflaton to\nnormal matter is determined by the vacuum expectation values of fields in the\ntheory. If those fields are light during inflation (this is a generic situation\nin the minimal models of supersymmetric inflation) they will fluctuate leading\nto density perturbations through the proposed mechanism. We show that these\nfluctuations could easily dominate over the ones generated through the standard\nmechanism. The new scenario has several consequences for inflation model\nbuilding and observations. The proposed mechanism allows to generate the\nobserved level of density perturbations with a much lower scale of inflation\nand thus generically predicts a smaller level of gravitational waves. The\nrelation between the slope of the spectrum of the produced density\nperturbations and the potential of the inflaton field is different from the\nstandard relations obtained in the context of slow roll inflation. Because the\nfield responsible for the fluctuations is not the inflaton, it can have\nsignificantly larger self couplings and thus density perturbations could be\nnon-Gaussian. The non-Gaussianity can be large enough to be detectable by CMB\nand Large Scale Structure observations.",

We identify two main emission\nregion, namely the core (also bright in thermal X-ray) and the outskirts region\nwhere accretion shocks occur. IC emission from shock accelerated CR electrons\ndominate the emission in the outer regions of galaxy clusters, provided that at\nleast a fraction of a percent of the shock ram pressure is converted into CR\nelectrons. A clear detection of this component and of its spatial distribution\nwill allow us direct probing of cosmic accretion shocks.

However, IC emission from\nshock accelerated electrons projected onto the cluster core will not be\nnegligible.

On such phase space we construct a\none parameter family of integrable hierarchies which preserves the mixed\nspectrum of the associated string spectral problem.

Using an infinite dimensional version of the Jacobi ellipsoidal\ncoordinates we obtain a one parameter family of canonical coordinates\nlinearizing the flows.",

This photon index is\nsignificantly flatter than the other AXPs, and resemble to soft gamma-ray\nrepeaters (SGRs) in the quiescent state. The pulse profile is double-peaked,\nand we found that the second peak has significantly hard spectrum. The spectra\nof all phases are consistent with power-law plus blackbody model with constant\ntemperature and photon index. When fitted with two blackbody model, we obtained\nsimilarly good fit.

The approach is quite\ngeneral, encompassing classical, quantum, discrete and continuous systems, the\nmain thrust going to quantum many body systems. Our central topic is the\nanalysis of the emergent properties of critical systems on the intermediate\nscales and in the scaling limit. To mention some particularly interesting\npoints, we show that systems typically loose part of their quantum character in\nthe scaling limit (vanishing of commutators) and we rigorously prove, with the\nhelp of the KMS-condition, the emergence of the phenomenon of critical slowing\ndown together with the necessity of renormalising the time variable.

When it\neventually dissolves, the cluster deposits a disproportionate number of massive\nstars in the innermost parsec of the Galactic nucleus.

    "summary": "Starting from a Zimm model we study selfdiffusion in a solution of\ncrosslinked monomers. We focus on the effects of the hydrodynamic interaction\non the dynamics and the critical behaviour at the sol-gel-point. Hydrodynamic\ninteractions cause the clusters' diffusion constant to depend not only on the\ncluster's size but also on the cluster's shape -- in contrast to the Rouse\nmodel. This gives rise to a nontrivial scaling of the Kirkwood diffusion\nconstant averaged over all clusters of fixed size $n$, ${\\hat D}_n\\sim\nn^{-{\\hat b}}$ with ${\\hat b}=1/d_s-1/2$ given in terms of the spectral\ndimension $d_s$ of critical percolation clusters. The long-time decay of the\nincoherent scattering function is determined by the diffusive motion of the\nlargest clusters. This implies the critical vanishing $D_{\\rm eff}\\sim\n\\epsilon^a$ of the cluster-averaged effective diffusion constant at the gel\npoint with exponent $a = (3/2 -\\tau +1/d_{s})/\\sigma$.",

    "summary": "Bipartite entanglement is one of the fundamental quantifiable resources of\nquantum information theory. We propose a new application of this resource to\nthe theory of quantum measurements. According to Naimark's theorem any rank 1\ngeneralised measurement (POVM) M may be represented as a von Neumann\nmeasurement in an extended (tensor product) space of the system plus ancilla.\nBy considering a suitable average of the entanglements of these measurement\ndirections and minimising over all Naimark extensions, we define a notion of\nentanglement cost E_min(M) of M.\n  We give a constructive means of characterising all Naimark extensions of a\ngiven POVM. We identify various classes of POVMs with zero and non-zero cost\nand explicitly characterise all POVMs in 2 dimensions having zero cost. We\nprove a constant upper bound on the entanglement cost of any POVM in any\ndimension. Hence the asymptotic entanglement cost (i.e. the large n limit of\nthe cost of n applications of M, divided by n) is zero for all POVMs.\n  The trine measurement is defined by three rank 1 elements, with directions\nsymmetrically placed around a great circle on the Bloch sphere. We give an\nanalytic expression for its entanglement cost. Defining a normalised cost of\nany d-dimensional POVM by E_min(M)/log(d), we show (using a combination of\nanalytic and numerical techniques) that the trine measurement is more costly\nthan any other POVM with d>2, or with d=2 and ancilla dimension 2. This\nstrongly suggests that the trine measurement is the most costly of all POVMs.",

This is similar to the dynamic asset\ntree studied recently, as both are based on correlations between asset returns.\nHowever, the new modified methodology does not, in general, lead to a tree but\na graph, or several graphs that need not be inter-connected. The asset tree,\ndue to the minimum spanning tree criterion, is forced to ``accept'' edge\nlengths that are far less optimal (longer) than the asset graph, thus resulting\nin higher overall length for the tree. The same criterion also causes asset\ntrees to be more fragile in structure when measured by the single-step survival\nratio. Over longer time periods, in the beginning the asset graph decays more\nslowly than the asset tree, but in the long-run the situation is reversed. The\nvertex degree distributions indicate that the possible scale free behavior of\nthe asset graph is not as evident as it is in the case of the asset tree.",

It is possible that the I-K colour of youthful stars\nis affected by the presence of magnetic activity. In the 2-colour diagram we\nfind no colour change across the \"M dwarf gap\" (which would be indicative of\ndust formation). For Teff=2800--3150K, the colours of Praesepe and Pleiades\nsources differ, which may result from gravity sensitive molecular opacities.\nPraesepe sources cooler than 2500K agree with the dusty models, but Pleiades\nsources agree with the NextGen models down to 2000K. It is possible that dust\nformation does not begin until lower Teffs in sources with lower surface\ngravities. We also identify unresolved binaries in both clusters, and estimate\nmass ratios (q) for Pleiades BDs. Most of these have q>0.7, however, 3/18\nappear to have lower q values.

The detailed consideration of the spin degrees of\nfreedom allows to discern the way in which the SU(2) spin invariance is\npreserved in the renormalization process. Regarding the spin correlations, we\nfind two different universality classes which correspond, in the context of the\nextended Hubbard model, to having the bare on-site interaction $U$ repulsive or\nattractive. The first class is characterized by a spin instability which\ndevelops through the condensation of particle-hole pairs with momentum ${\\bf\nQ}$, with the disappearance of the Fermi line in the neighborhood of the\nsaddle-points. Within that class, the attractive or repulsive character of the\nnearest-neighbor interaction $V$ dictates whether there is or not a d-wave\nsuperconducting instability in the system. For the Hubbard model with just\non-site interaction, we show that some of the irrelevant operators are able to\ntrigger the superconducting instability. The naturalness of the competing\ninstabilities is guaranteed by the existence of a range of doping levels in\nwhich the chemical potential of the open system is renormalized to the level of\nthe saddle-points. We incorporate this effect to obtain the phase diagram as a\nfunction of the bare chemical potential, which displays a point of optimal\ndoping separating the regions of superconductivity and spin instability.",

    "summary": "After recalling episodes from Pascual Jordan's biography including his\npivotal role in the shaping of quantum field theory and his much criticized\nconduct during the NS regime, I draw attention to his presentation of the first\nphase of development of quantum field theory in a talk presented at the 1929\nKharkov conference. He starts by giving a comprehensive account of the\nbeginnings of quantum theory, emphasising that particle-like properties arise\nas a consequence of treating wave-motions quantum-mechanically. He then goes on\nto his recent discovery of quantization of ``wave fields'' and problems of\ngauge invariance. The most surprising aspect of Jordan's presentation is\nhowever his strong belief that his field quantization is a transitory not yet\noptimal formulation of the principles underlying causal, local quantum physics.\nThe expectation of a future more radical change coming from the main architect\nof field quantization already shortly after his discovery is certainly quite\nstartling. I try to answer the question to what extent Jordan's 1929\nexpectations have been vindicated. The larger part of the present essay\nconsists in arguing that Jordan's plea for a formulation without ``classical\ncorrespondence crutches'', i.e. for an intrinsic approach (which avoids\nclassical fields altogether), is successfully addressed in past and recent\npublications on local quantum physics.",

This\ncorrelation is estimated using the past history itself, and is used by a\nfraction of agents to devise active trading strategies. The impact of these\nstrategies on the price modify the observed correlations. A potentially\nunstable feedback loop appears and destabilizes the market from an efficient\nbehaviour. For large enough feedbacks, we find a `phase transition' beyond\nwhich non trivial correlations spontaneously set in and where the market\nswitches between two long lived states, that we call conventions. This\nmechanism leads to overreaction and excess volatility, which may be\nconsiderable in the convention phase. A particularly relevant case is when the\nsource of information is the price itself. The two conventions then correspond\nthen to either a trend following regime or to a contrarian (mean reverting)\nregime. We provide some empirical evidence for the existence of these\nconventions in real markets, that can last for several decades.",

Thus direct dark matter detection is\ncentral to particle physics and cosmology. Supersymmetry provides a natural\ndark matter candidate, the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). It is\npossible to obtain detectable rates, but realystically they are expected to be\nmuch lower than the present experimental goals. So one should exploit two\ncharacteristic signatures of the reaction, namely the modulation effect and the\ncorrelation with the sun's motion in directional experiments. In standard non\ndirectional experiments the modulation is small, less than two per cent. In the\ncase of the directional experiments, the main subject of this paper, we find\ntwo novel features, which are essentially independent of the SUSY model\nemployed, namely: 1) The forward-backward asymmetry, with respect to the sun's\ndirection of motion, is very large and 2) The modulation observed in a plane\nperpendicular to the sun's motion can be higher than 20 per cent and is\ndirection dependent.",

The method is based on the detection of the Coherent\nSynchrotron Radiation (CSR) spectrum produced by a bunch passing a dipole\nmagnet system. This work also contains a systematic treatment of synchrotron\nradiation theory which lies at the basis of CSR. Standard theory of synchrotron\nradiation uses several approximations whose applicability limits are often\nforgotten: here we present a systematic discussion about these assumptions.\nProperties of coherent synchrotron radiation from an electron moving along an\narc of a circle are then derived and discussed. We describe also an effective\nand practical diagnostic technique based on the utilization of an\nelectromagnetic undulator to record the energy of the coherent radiation pulse\ninto the central cone. This measurement must be repeated many times with\ndifferent undulator resonant frequencies in order to reconstruct the modulus of\nthe bunch form-factor. The retrieval of the bunch profile function from these\ndata is performed by means of deconvolution techniques: for the present work we\ntake advantage of a constrained deconvolution method. We illustrate with\nnumerical examples the potential of the proposed method for electron beam\ndiagnostics at the TESLA Test Facility (TTF) accelerator. Here we choose, for\nemphasis, experiments aimed at the measure of the strongly non-Gaussian\nelectron bunch profile in the TTF femtosecond-mode operation. We demonstrate\nthat a tandem combination of a picosecond streak camera and a CSR spectrometer\ncan be used to extract shape information from electron bunches with a narrow\nleading peak and a long tail.",

The\ninflow of gas in bars today appears to stall at a radius of few hundred parsec,\nhowever, forming a nuclear ring. Here we suggest that bars in the early\nUniverse may have avoided this problem, and propose that the progenitors of\ncentral supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are created by gas that is driven deep\ninto the centers of galaxies by bars in the early stages of disk formation. The\ncoincidence of the QSO epoch with galaxy formation, the short lifetimes of\nQSOs, and the existence of SMBHs in the centers of most bright galaxies are all\nnaturally accounted for by disk dynamics in this model. The progenitor SMBHs\nare the seeds for brighter QSO flares during galaxy mergers. We present a new\nstudy of bar weakening by central mass concentrations, which shows that bars\nare less easily destroyed than previously thought. An extremely massive and\ncompact central mass can, however, dissolve the bar, which creates a\npseudo-bulge component in the center of the disk.",

The mode expansion of bulk fields on the\ngravity side is shown to be precisely dual to the \"boundary operator product\nexpansion\" of operators as they approach the defect. From the field theory\npoint of view, the condition for localization is that a \"reduced operator\"\nappearing in this expansion acquires negative anomalous dimension. In\nparticular, a very light localized graviton exists when a mode arising from the\nreduction of the ambient stress-energy tensor to the defect has conformal\ndimension Delta ~ d-1. The part of the stress tensor containing the defect\ndynamics has dimension Delta = d-1 in the free theory, but we argue that it\nacquires an anomalous dimension in the interacting theory, and hence does not\nparticipate in localization in the regime of small backreaction of the brane.\nWe demonstrate that such an anomalous dimension is consistent with the\nconservation of the full stress-energy tensor.

This confirms\nquantitatively earlier speculations that early-type galaxies are calcium\nunderabundant. We find a clear correlation between alpha/Ca ratio and central\nvelocity dispersion, which implies that more massive galaxies are more calcium\nunderabundant. Interestingly this correlation extends down to the dwarf\nspheroidal galaxies of the Local Group for which alpha/Ca ratios have been\nmeasured from high-resolution spectroscopy of individual stars (Shetrone et\nal.). The increase of the calcium underabundance with galaxy mass balances the\nhigher total metallicities of more massive galaxies, so that calcium abundance\nin early-type galaxies is fairly constant and in particular does not increase\nwith increasing galaxy mass. This result may be the key to understand why the\nCaII triplet absorption of early-type galaxies at 8600 A is constant to within\n5 per cent over a large range of velocity dispersions (Saglia et al.; Cenarro\net al.). The origin of the calcium underabundance in early-type galaxies\nremains yet to be understood. We argue that formation timescales are\ndisfavoured to produce calcium underabundance, and that the option of\nmetallicity dependent supernova yields may be the most promising track to\nfollow.",

The spectral\nindices from 1-16micron range from alpha_IR 0.9 to 3.8. The shapes of the\nspectra are correlated with Seyfert type in the sense that steeper nuclear SEDs\n(nu*f_nu increasing with increasing wavelength) tend to be found in Seyfert 2s\nand flatter SEDs (nu *f_nu constant) in Seyfert 1-1.5s. The galaxies optically\nclassified as Seyferts 1.8s and 1.9s display values of alpha_IR as in type 1\nobjects, or values intermediate between those of Seyfert 1s and Seyfert 2s. The\nintermediate SEDs of many Seyfert 1.8-1.9s may be consistent with the presence\nof a pure Seyfert 1 viewed through a moderate amount (A_V <5mag) of foreground\ngalaxy extinction. We find, however, that between 10 and 20% of galaxies with\nbroad optical line components have steep infrared SEDs.\n  Torus models usually adopt high equatorial opacities to reproduce the\ninfrared properties of Seyfert 1s and 2s, resulting in a dichotomy of infrared\nSEDs (flat for type 1s, and steep for type 2s). Such a dichotomy, however, is\nnot observed in our sample. The wide range of spectral indices observed in the\ntype 2 objects, the lack of extremely steep SEDs, and the large numbers of\nobjects with intermediate spectral indices cannot be reconciled with\npredictions from existing optically thick torus models. We discuss possible\nmodifications to improve torus models, including low optical depth tori, clumpy\ndusty tori, and high-optical-depth tori with an extended optically thin\ncomponent.",

Spectral observations show multiple absorbers at\nz3A=2.323, z3B= 2.317, and z3C= 2.293 blueshifted by 450, 990, and 3,155 km/s\nrespectively relative to the host galaxy Lyman-alpha emission.

The chemical abundance ratios\nindicate that the nebula is overabundant in carbon and silicon. The high level\nof carbon and silicon is consistent with a swept-up shell nebula gradually\nenriched by a WCL progenitor wind over the lifetime of the nebula prior to the\nGRB onset. The detection of statistically significant fluctuations and color\nchanges about the jet-like optical decay further supports this interpretation\nsince fluctuations must be present at some level due to inhomogeneities in a\nclumpy stellar wind medium or if the progenitor has undergone massive ejection\nprior to the GRB onset. This evidence suggests that the mass-loss process in a\nWolf-Rayet star might lead naturally to an iron-core collapse with sufficient\nangular momentum that could serve as a suitable GRB progenitor.",

This code implements the\ncascade-evaporation-fission model of intermediate-energy photonuclear\nreactions. It includes multiparticle production in photoreactions on\nintranuclear nucleons, pre-equilibrium emission, and the statistical decay of\nexcited residual nuclei via competition of evaporation, fission, and\nmultifragmentation processes. The calculations show that in the GeV energy\nregion the fission process is not solely responsible for the entire total\nphotoabsorption cross section, even for the actinides: ~55-70% for 232-Th,\n\\~70-80% for 238-U, and ~80-95% for 233-U, 235-U, and 237-Np. This is because\ncertain residual nuclei that are created by deep photospallation at GeV photon\nenergies have relatively low fission probabilities. Using the recent\nexperimental data on photofission cross sections for 237-Np and 233,235,238-U\nfrom the Saskatchewan and Jefferson Laboratories and our calculated fission\nprobabilities, we infer the total photoabsorption cross sections for these four\nnuclei. The resulting cross sections per nucleon agree in shape and in\nmagnitude with each other.

The tight K-z relation of\nluminous, high redshift, radio galaxies is probably a selection effect due to\nthe selection on high black hole masses and high accretion rates. Luminous\nradio galaxies are the radio-loud part of the ``quasar-2'' population, and the\nratio of radio-loud quasars to luminous radio galaxies, about 1:1, is so far\nour only good estimate of the relative numbers of quasar-1s and quasar-2s.

We give examples of\npossible laboratory experiments that investigate into the extreme universe.",

    "summary": "Applying the dynamical coherent potential approximation to a simple model, we\nhave systematically studied the carrier states in $A_{1-x}$Mn$_xB$-type diluted\nmagnetic semiconductors (DMS's). The model calculation was performed for three\ntypical cases of DMS's: The cases with strong and moderate exchange\ninteractions in the absence of nonmagnetic potentials, and the case with strong\nattractive nonmagnetic potentials in addition to moderate exchange interaction.\nWhen the exchange interaction is sufficiently strong, magnetic impurity bands\nsplit from the host band. Carriers in the magnetic impurity band mainly stay at\nmagnetic sites, and coupling between the carrier spin and the localized spin is\nvery strong. The hopping of the carriers among the magnetic sites causes\nferromagnetism through a {\\it double-exchange (DE)-like} mechanism. We have\ninvestigated the condition for the DE-like mechanism to operate in DMS's. The\nresult reveals that the nonmagnetic attractive potential at the magnetic site\nassists the formation of the magnetic impurity band and makes the DE-like\nmechanism operative by substantially enhancing the effect of the exchange\ninteraction. Using conventional parameters we have studied the carrier states\nin Ga$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$As. The result shows that the ferromagnetism is caused\nthrough the DE-like mechanism by the carriers in the bandtail originating from\nthe impurity states.",

Many\ndistributed systems, especially those employed in safety-critical environments,\nshould be able to operate properly even in the presence of software faults.\nMonitoring the execution of a distributed system, and, on detecting a fault,\ninitiating the appropriate corrective action is an important way to tolerate\nsuch faults. This gives rise to the predicate detection problem which requires\nfinding a consistent cut of a given computation that satisfies a given global\npredicate, if it exists.\n  Detecting a predicate in a computation is, however, an NP-complete problem.\nTo ameliorate the associated combinatorial explosion problem, we introduce the\nnotion of computation slice. Formally, the slice of a computation with respect\nto a predicate is a (sub)computation with the least number of consistent cuts\nthat contains all consistent cuts of the computation satisfying the predicate.\nTo detect a predicate, rather than searching the state-space of the\ncomputation, it is much more efficient to search the state-space of the slice.\n  We prove that the slice exists and is uniquely defined for all predicates. We\npresent efficient slicing algorithms for several useful classes of predicates.\nWe develop efficient heuristic algorithms for computing an approximate slice\nfor predicates for which computing the slice is otherwise provably intractable.\nOur experimental results show that slicing can lead to an exponential\nimprovement over existing techniques for predicate detection in terms of time\nand space.",

We nucleate a\nbubble at each center using the extended Potts model and let the structure\nevolve under the constraint of scaled target areas until the bubbles contact\neach other. The target area constraint and pinning centers prevent further\ncoarsening. We then turn the area constraint off and let the edges relax to a\nminimum energy configuration.

We repeated this procedure for various stages of the\ncoarsening of the same simulated foam and investigated the simulation and\nreconstruction dynamics, topology and area distribution, finding that they\nagree to good accuracy.",

    "summary": "In this paper, we investigate the commutative algebra of the cohomology ring\n$H^*(G,k)$ of a finite group $G$ over a field $k$. We relate the concept of\nquasi-regular sequence, introduced by Benson and Carlson, to the local\ncohomology of the cohomology ring. We give some slightly strengthened versions\nof quasi-regularity, and relate one of them to Castelnuovo--Mumford regularity.\nWe prove that the existence of a quasi-regular sequence in either the original\nsense or the strengthened ones is true if and only if the Dickson invariants\nform a quasi-regular sequence in the same sense. The proof involves the notion\nof virtual projectivity, introduced by Carlson, Peng and Wheeler.\n  As a by-product of this investigation, we give a new proof of the\nBourguiba--Zarati theorem on depth and Dickson invariants, in the context of\nfinite group cohomology, without using the machinery of unstable modules over\nthe Steenrod algebra.\n  Finally, we describe an improvement of Carlson's algorithm for computing the\ncohomology of a finite group using a finite initial segment of a projective\nresolution of the trivial module. In contrast to Carlson's algorithm, ours does\nnot depend on verifying any conjectures during the course of the calculation,\nand is always guaranteed to work.",

We present the\nresults of a statistical analysis of {\\em temperature bias} in $H_0$\ndeterminations in a sample of 27 numerically simulated X-ray clusters drawn\nfrom a $\\Lambda$CDM model at z=0.5. We employ adaptive mesh refinement to\nprovide high resolution (15.6 h$^{-1} kpc$) in cluster cores which dominate the\nX-ray and radio signals. Fitting synthetic X-ray and y-parameter maps to the\nstandard isothermal beta model, we find a broad, skewed distribution in\n$f\\equiv H_0(SZ)/H_0(actual)$ with a mean, median, and standard deviation of\n0.89, 0.83 and 0.32 respectively, where $H_0(SZ)$ is the value of $H_0$ derived\nby using Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect method and $H_0(actual)$ is the value used in\nthe cosmological simulation. We find that the clusters' declining temperature\nprofiles systematically lower estimates of $H_0$ by 10% to 20%. The declining\ntemperature profile of our adiabatic system is consistent with the result\nincluding radiative cooling and supernovae feedback (Loken et al. 2002).

Applying\nthe non-isothermal $\\beta$ model to the refined sample with well-fitted\ntemperature profile, the value of f improves 9% relative to the actual value.\nThe study of the morphology and the clumping effects conclude that these two\nfactors combine to induce scatter in f of $\\pm$ 30 %.",

Relevant operators are absent. The model\nexhibits an infinite series of bound state energy eigenvalues. This infinite\nseries approaches an exact geometric series as the eigenvalues approach zero -\nalso a consequence of the limit cycle. Wegner's eigenvalues for irrelevant\noperators are calculated generically for all choices of parameters in the\nmodel. We show that Wegner's eigenvalues are independent of location on the\nlimit cycle, in contrast with Wegner's operators themselves, which vary\ndepending on their location on the limit cycle. An example is then used to\nillustrate numerically how one can tune the initial Hamiltonian to eliminate\nthe first two irrelevant operators. After tuning, the Hamiltonian's bound state\neigenvalues converge much more quickly than otherwise to an exact geometric\nseries.",

The classical\nconstruction (due to Morse, Smale, Thom, Witten), based on the counting of flow\nlines joining critical points of the function $f$ associates to these data the\nMorse complex $M_*(f,v)$. In the present paper we introduce a new class of\nvector fields ($f$-gradients) associated to a Morse function $f$. This class is\nwider than the class of Riemannian gradients and provides a natural framework\nfor the study of the Morse complex. Our construction of the Morse complex does\nnot use the counting of the flow lines, but rather the fundamental classes of\nthe stable manifolds, and this allows to replace the transversality condition\nrequired in the classical setting by a weaker condition on the $f$-gradient\n(almost transversality condition) which is $C^0$-stable. We prove then that the\nMorse complex is stable with respect to $C^0$-small perturbations of the\n$f$-gradient, and study the functorial properties of the Morse complex. The\nlast two sections of the paper are devoted to the properties of functoriality\nand $C^0$-stability for the Novikov complex $N_*(f,v)$ where $f$ is a\ncircle-valued Morse map and $v$ is an almost transverse $f$-gradient.",

Our calculations demonstrate that there are two criteria for\nentanglement, one associated with the two-photon coherences that create\ntwo-photon entangled states, and the other associated with populations of the\ncollective states. We find that the spin-squeezing parameter correctly predicts\nentanglement in the two-atom Dicke system only if it is associated with\ntwo-photon entangled states, but fails to predict entanglement when it is\nassociated with the entangled symmetric state. This explicitly identifies the\nsource of the discrepancy and explains why the system can be entangled without\nspin-squeezing. We illustrate these findings in three examples of the\ninteraction of the system with thermal, classical squeezed vacuum and quantum\nsqueezed vacuum fields.",

Such devices are especially\nimportant for linear optical quantum computing with projective measurements.\nHowever, in this paper I show that it is impossible to construct a\nphotodetector with single-photon resolution when we are restricted to\nsingle-photon sources, linear optical elements and projective measurements with\nstandard (non-photon-number discriminating) photodetectors.

The method employs non-parametric\nmorphological descriptors known as the Minkowski functionals in combination\nwith geometric moments widely used in the image analysis. For the purpose of\nvisualization of the morphological properties of image contour lines we\nintroduce three auxiliary ellipses representing the vector and tensor Minkowski\nfunctionals. We study the discreteness, seeing, and noise effects on elliptic\ncontours as well as their morphological characteristics such as the ellipticity\nand orientation. In order to reduce the effect of noise we employ a technique\nof contour smoothing. We test the method by studying simulated elliptic\nprofiles of toy spheroidal galaxies ranging in ellipticity from E0 to E7. We\nthen apply the method to real galaxies, including eight spheroidals, three disk\nspirals and one peculiar galaxy, as imaged in the near-infrared $K_s$-band (2.2\nmicrons) with the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS). The method is numerically\nvery efficient and can be used in the study of hundreds of thousands images\nobtained in modern surveys.",

To estimate the effect of the resolution bias on\nour observations we have modelled the effective angular-size distribution of\nthe sources in our sample and we have used this distribution to simulate a\nsample of radio sources. Finally we present the radio count distribution down\nto 0.08 mJy derived from the catalogue.

Spectroscopic data are obtained for H II\nregions in 11 Virgo dIs distributed in the central and outer regions of the\ncluster. To ensure that oxygen abundances are derived in a homogeneous manner,\noxygen abundances for field and Virgo dIs are computed using the bright-line\nmethod and compared with abundances directly obtained from [O III]4363, where\navailable. They are found to agree to within about 0.2 dex with no systematic\noffset. At a given optical luminosity, there is no systematic difference in\noxygen abundance between the sample of Virgo dIs and the sample of nearby dIs.\nHowever, five of the eleven Virgo dIs exhibit much lower baryonic gas fractions\nthan field dIs at comparable oxygen abundances. Using field dIs as a reference,\na gas-deficiency index for dIs is constructed, making it possible\nquantitatively to identify which galaxies have lost gas. For the Virgo sample,\nsome of the dwarfs are gas-deficient by a factor of 30. The gas-deficiency\ncorrelates roughly with the X-ray surface brightness of the intracluster gas.\nRam-pressure stripping can best explain the observed gas-poor dIs in the\ncluster sample. Together with the lack of significant fading and reddening of\nthe gas-poor dIs compared to gas-normal dIs, these observations suggest that\nthe gas-poor dIs in Virgo have recently encountered the intracluster medium for\nthe first time. Faded remnants of gas-poor dIs in Virgo will resemble bright\ndwarf ellipticals presently seen in the cluster core.",

In this talk, I would like to discuss a recent novel approach to\nthe issue based on the \"vector manifestation\" scenario discovered by Harada and\nYamawaki in hidden local symmetry theory. For simplicity, I will restrict\nmyself to two extreme scenarios: one that we shall refer to as \"standard\" in\nwhich pions are considered to be the $only$ low-lying degrees of freedom and\nthe other that could be referred to as \"non-standard\" in which in addition to\npions, other degrees of freedom figure in the process. In particular, I shall\nconsider the scenario that arises at one-loop order in chiral perturbation\ntheory with hidden local symmetry Lagrangian consisting of pions as well as\nnearly massless vector mesons that figure importantly at the ``vector\nmanifestation (VM)\" fixed point. It will be shown that if the VM is realized in\nnature, the chiral phase structure of hadronic matter can be much richer than\nthat in the standard one and the chiral phase transition will be a smooth\ncrossover: Sharp vector and scalar excitations are expected in the vicinity of\nthe critical point. Some indirect indications that lend support to the VM\nscenario are discussed.",

Although the FDWE has been found to reflect anomalous energy dissipations,\nthe physical significance of the equation has not been clearly explained in\nthis regard.

A trans-relativistic external shock\ndynamic model by analogy with the evolution of gamma-ray burst remnants, is\nshown to be able to fit the observation data reasonably well. The inferred\ninterstellar medium density around the source is well below the canonical value\n$n_ISM \\sim 1 cm^{-3}$. We find that the emission from the continuously shocked\ninterstellar medium (forward shock region) decays too slowly to be a viable\nmechanism for the eastern X-ray jet. However, the rapidly fading X-ray emission\ncan be interpreted as synchrotron radiation from the non-thermal electrons in\nthe adiabatically expanding ejecta. These electrons were accelerated by the\nreverse shock (moving back into the ejecta) which becomes important when the\ninertia of the swept external matter leads to an appreciable slowing down of\nthe original ejecta. To ensure the dominance of the emission from the shocked\nejecta over that from the forward shock region during the period of the\nobservations, the magnetic field and electron energy fractions in the forward\nshock region must be far below equipartition. Future continuous, follow-up\nmulti-wavelength observations of new ejection events from microquasars up to\nthe significant deceleration phase should provide more valuable insight into\nthe nature of the interaction between the jets and external medium.",

After extension of the valuation to a\nsuitable completion (whose existence is not established in the paper) the\nrelation becomes much more precise, and suggests a possible way to establish\nlocal uniformization for an excellent equicharacteristic local domain with an\nalgebraically closed residue field, by deforming a partial toric embedded\nresolution of the essentially toric spectrum of the associated graded ring.",

Synthetic emission profiles are also\ncalculated and fitted to the observed emission patterns.

These models are the first to include a fully consistent description of\nthe magnetic field, 2D geometry, plasma density and temperature, flow velocity\nand thermodynamics of loops. The consistently calculated heating profiles which\nare largely dominated by radiative losses are influenced by the flow and are\nasymmetrical being concentrated at the upflow footpoint.",

    "summary": "An elementary constituent-quark (CQ) model by Mac Gregor is reviewed with\ncurrently published data from light meson spectroscopy. It was previously shown\nin the CQ model that there existed several mass quanta m = 70 MeV, B = 140 MeV\nand X = 420 MeV, which were responsible for the quantization of meson yrast\nlevels. The existence of a 70-MeV quantum was postulated by Mac Gregor and was\nshown to fit the Nambu empirical mass formula mn = (n/2)137me, n a positive\ninteger. The 70-MeV quantum can be derived in three different ways: 1) pure\nelectric coupling, 2) pure magnetic coupling, and 3) mixed electric and\nmagnetic charges (dyons). Schwinger first introduced dyons in a magnetic model\nof matter. It is shown in this paper that recent data of new light mesons fit\ninto the CQ model (a pure electric model) without the introduction of magnetic\ncharges. However, by introducing electric and magnetic quarks (dyons) into the\nCQ model, new dynamical forces can be generated by the presence of magnetic\nfields internal to the quarks (dyons). The laws of angular momentum and of\nenergy conservation are valid in the presence of magnetic charge. With the\nintroduction of the Russell-Saunders coupling scheme into the CQ model, several\nnew meson particles are predicted to exist. The existence of the f0(560) meson\nis predicted and is shown to fit current experimental data from the Particle\nData Group listing. The existence of meson partners or groupings is shown.",

The lack of MSPs and LMXBs rotating\nnear break-up and the similar rotation periods of several LMXBs have been\nattributed to the accretion torque being balanced, at fast rotation, by\ngravitational radiation, perhaps caused by an oscillation mode made unstable\nthrough the so-called Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz mechanism. Recently,\nWagoner has argued that internal dissipation through weak interaction processes\ninvolving $\\Lambda^0$ and $\\Sigma^-$ hyperons may cause LMXBs to evolve into a\nquasi-steady state, in which the neutron star has a nearly constant rotation\nrate, temperature, and mode amplitude. We take this hypothesis one step\nfurther, showing that MSPs descending from these LMXBs spend a long time in a\nsimilar state, in which a low-amplitude r-mode turns them into extremely steady\nsources of both gravitational waves and thermal X-rays, while they spin down\ndue to a combination of gravitational radiation and the standard magnetic\ntorque.

FM\ndouble-exchange interactions associated with doped eg electrons are favored\nover competing AFM interactions at higher temperatures, and couple more\nstrongly with the lattice via orbital polarization.

Glassy effects arise at low temperatures\n$T$ from the kinetic constraint that spins can only flip if their left\nneighbour is up. We give details of our previous solution of the\nnon-equilibrium coarsening dynamics after a quench to low $T$ (Phys. Rev.\\\nLett. 83:3238, 1999), including the anomalous coarsening of down-spin domains\nwith typical size $\\bar{d} \\sim t^{T \\ln 2}$, and the pronounced `fragile\nglass'-divergence of equilibration times as $t_*=\\exp(1/T^2\\ln 2)$. We also\nlink the model to the paste-all coarsening model, defining a family of\ninterpolating models that all have the same scaling distribution of domain\nsizes. We then proceed to the problem of equilibrium dynamics at low $T$. Based\non a scaling hypothesis for the relation between timescales and lengthscales,\nwe propose a model for the dynamics of `superdomains' which are bounded by\nup-spins that are frozen on long timescales. From this we deduce that the\nequilibrium spin correlation and persistence functions should exhibit identical\nscaling behaviour for low $T$, decaying as $g(\\tilde{t})$. The scaling variable\nis $\\tilde{t}=(t/t_*)^{T\\ln 2}$, giving strongly stretched behaviour for low\n$T$. The scaling function $g(\\cdot)$ decays faster than exponential, however,\nand in the limit $T\\to 0$ at fixed $\\tilde{t}$ reaches zero at a {\\em finite}\nvalue of $\\tilde{t}$.",

This is the routinely observed phenomenon of vacuum polarization. We\nshow that the quantum fluctuations of low mass, scalar fields are enormously\namplified during inflation. If one of these fields is charged, the vacuum\npolarization effect of flat space is strengthened to the point that long wave\nlength photons acquire mass. Our result for this mass is shown to agree with a\nsimple model in which the massive photon electrodynamics of Proca emerges from\napplying the Hartree approximation to scalar quantum electrodynamics during\ninflation. A huge photon mass is not measured today because the original phase\nof inflation ended when the universe was only a tiny fraction of a second old.\nHowever, the zero-point energy left over from the epoch of large photon mass\nmay have persisted during the post-inflationary universe as very weak, but\ncosmological-scale, magnetic fields.

Here\nit is shown that the regime extends down to order N_c^{1/2} which includes the\nhigher end of the elastic regime. The prediction is that in the large N_c\nlimit, observables describable via mean-field theory are unchanged when the\nspin and isospin of either nucleon are both flipped. This prediction is tested\nfor proton-proton and neutron-proton elastic scattering data and found to fail\nbadly. We argue that this failure can be traced to a lack of a clear separation\nof scales between momentum of order N_c^{1/2} and N_c^1 when N_c is as small as\nthree. The situation is compounded by an anomalously low particle production\nthreshold due to approximate chiral symmetry.",

The\ncomparison with recent results from the 2QZ shows that the correlation function\nof QSOs is constant in redshift or marginally increasing toward low redshift.\nWe discuss this behavior with physically motivated models, deriving interesting\nconstraints on the typical mass of the dark matter halos hosting QSOs, M_DMH=\n10^{12.7} h^{-1} M_sun (10^{12.0}-10^{13.5}h^{-1} M_sun at 1 sigma confidence\nlevel).

We model the full radial extent of their\nlight-profiles by simultaneously fitting a PSF-convolved Sersic R^(1/n) model\nand, when necessary, either a central point-source or a central PSF-convolved\nGaussian. The luminosities of the central component L_nuc scale with the host\ngalaxy luminosity L_gal such that L_nuc = 10^(4.76 +/- 0.10)*(L_gal/10^7)^(0.87\n+/- 0.26). The underlying host galaxies display systematic departures from an\nexponential model that are correlated with the model-independent host galaxy\nluminosity and are not due to biasing from the nuclear component. The Pearson\ncorrelation coefficient between log(n) and central galaxy surface brightness\nmu_0 (excluding the flux from extraneous central components) is -0.83 at a\nsignificance level of 99.99%. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the\nlogarithm of the Sersic index `n' and the host galaxy magnitude is -0.77 at a\nsignificance of 99.9%. We explain the observed relationship between dE galaxy\nluminosity and inner logarithmic profile slope (gamma-prime) as a by-product of\nthe correlation between luminosity and Sersic index n. Including, from the\nliterature, an additional 232 dE and E galaxies spanning 10 mag in absolute\nmagnitude (M), the dE galaxies are shown to display a continuous sequence with\nthe brighter E galaxies such that mu_0 brightens linearly with M until core\nformation causes the most luminous (M_B < -20.5 mag) E galaxies to deviate from\nthis relation. The different behavior of dE and E galaxies in the M-mu_e (and\nM-<mu>_e) diagram, and the <mu>_e-log(R_e) diagram have nothing to do with core\nformation, and are in fact expected from the continuous and linear relation\nbetween M and mu_0 and M and log(n).",

In an analysis which parallels the blue fractions of Butcher-Oemler\nstudies, we calculated radio galaxy fractions for the clusters.

We compare the results for Abell 2255 with\nthose for Abell 2256 to assess the role of cluster-cluster mergers on the star\nformation activity of member galaxies. From these clusters, as well as several\nidentified in other studies, a picture emerges in which substructure and\ncluster dynamical activity are of great importance in understanding\nevolutionary phenomenon such as the Butcher-Oemler Effect. Increased fractions\nof active galaxies (be they the blue galaxies of Butcher-Oemler studies or\nradio galaxies as discussed here) naturally result as clusters are built\nthrough mergers of smaller groups in hierarchical formation scenarios.

We find that the rest-frame color distribution of these galaxies is\nbimodal at all redshifts out to z~1. This bimodality permits a\nmodel-independent definition of red, early-type galaxies and blue, late-type\ngalaxies at any given redshift. The colors of the blue peak become redder\ntowards the present day, and the number density of blue luminous galaxies has\ndropped strongly since z~1. Focusing on the red galaxies, we find that they\npopulate a color-magnitude relation. Such red sequences have been identified in\ngalaxy cluster environments, but our data show that such a sequence exists over\nthis redshift range even when averaging over all environments. The mean color\nof the red galaxy sequence evolves with redshift in a way that is consistent\nwith the aging of an ancient stellar population. The rest-frame B-band\nluminosity density in red galaxies evolves only mildly with redshift in a\nLambda-dominated cold dark matter universe. Accounting for the change in\nstellar mass-to-light ratio implied by the redshift evolution in red galaxy\ncolors, the COMBO-17 data indicate an increase in stellar mass on the red\nsequence by a factor of two since z~1. The largest source of uncertainty is\nlarge-scale structure, implying that considerably larger surveys are necessary\nto further refine this result. We explore mechanisms that may drive this\nevolution in the red galaxy population, finding that both galaxy merging and\ntruncation of star formation in some fraction of the blue, star-forming\npopulation are required to fully explain the properties of these galaxies.",

Six of the galaxies exhibit spatially\nextended, tilted H-alpha emission lines; rotation curves for these objects\nreach mean velocities of ~150 km/s at radii of ~6 kpc, without corrections for\nany observational effects.

We find a mean SFR_H-alpha of 16 M_sun/yr and an average\nSFR_H-alpha/SFR_UV ratio of 2.4, without correcting for extinction.

We\nshow that the heating rate induced by the Lyman alpha scatterings is much lower\nthan found previously, and is basically negligible. The dominant heating source\nis most likely the X-rays from the first ionizing sources, which are able to\npenetrate into the atomic medium. The scattering of Lyman alpha photons couples\nthe hydrogen spin temperature to the kinetic temperature. If the first ionizing\nsources in the universe did not emit significant X-rays, the spin temperature\nwould be rapidly brought down to the very low gas kinetic temperature, and a\n21cm absorption signal against the CMB larger than 100 mK would be predicted.\nHowever, we argue that sufficient X-rays are likely to have been emitted by the\nfirst stellar population, implying that the gas kinetic temperature should\nrapidly increase, turning a reduced and brief absorption signal into emission,\nwith a smaller amplitude of about 10 mK.

    "summary": "High-quality spectropolarimetry (range 417-860 nm; spectral resolution 1.27\nnm and 0.265 nm/pixel) of the SN Ia 2001el were obtained with the ESO Very\nLarge Telescope Melipal (+ FORS1) at 5 epochs. The spectra a week before\nmaximum and around maximum indicate photospheric expansion velocities of about\n10,000 km s$^{-1}$. Prior to optical maximum, the linear polarization of the\ncontinuum was $\\approx 0.2 - 0.3 %$ with a constant position angle, showing\nthat SN 2001el has a well-defined axis of symmetry. The polarization was nearly\nundetectable a week after optical maximum. The spectra are similar to those of\nthe normally-bright SN 1994D with the exception of a strong double-troughed\nabsorption feature seen around 800 nm (FWHM about 22 nm). This feature could be\nan important clue to the binary nature of SN Ia, perhaps associated with an\naccretion disk, or to the nature of the thermonuclear burning. If modeled in\nterms of an oblate spheroid, the continuum polarization implies a minor to\nmajor axis ratio of around 0.9 if seen equator-on; this level of asymmetry\nwould produce an absolute luminosity dispersion of about 0.1 mag when viewed at\ndifferent viewing angles. If typical for SNe Ia, this would create an RMS\nscatter of several hundredths of a magnitude around the mean brightness-decline\nrelation.",

Both epoch observations are 50 ks exposures\nof the ACIS-S3 chip and they are separated by 2 years. Measurements of the thin\nX-ray continuum dominated filaments located around the edge of the remnant\n(that are identified with the forward shock) show expansion rates from 0.02%/yr\nto 0.33%/yr. Many of these filaments are therefore significantly decelerated.\nTheir median value of 0.21%/yr is equal to the median expansion of the bright\nring (0.21%/yr) as measured with Einstein and ROSAT. This presents a conundrum\nif the motion of the bright ring is indicative of the reverse shock speed. We\nhave also re-evaluated the motion of the radio bright ring with emphasis on\nangle-averaged emissivity profiles. Our new measurement of the expansion of the\nangle-averaged radio bright ring is 0.07 plus or minus 0.03%/yr, somewhat\nslower than the previous radio measurements of 0.11%/yr which were sensitive to\nthe motions of small-scale features. We propose that the expansion of the\nsmall-scale bright ring features in the optical, X-ray, and radio do not\nrepresent the expansion of the reverse shock, but rather represent a\nbrightness-weighted average of ejecta passing through and being decelerated by\nthe reverse shock. The motion of the reverse shock, itself, is then represented\nby the motion of the angle-averaged emissivity profile of the radio bright\nring.",

    "summary": "Nonthermal particles can be produced due to incomplete thermalization at\ncollisionless shocks and further accelerated to very high energies via\ndiffusive shock acceleration. In a previous study we explored the cosmic ray\n(CR) acceleration at cosmic shocks through numerical simulations of CR\nmodified, quasi-parallel shocks in 1D plane-parallel geometry with the physical\nparameters relevant for the shocks emerging in the large scale structure\nformation of the universe (Kang & Jones 2002). In order to consider the CR\nacceleration at shocks with a broader range of physical properties, in this\ncontribution we present additional simulations. For a given Mach number, shocks\nwith higher speeds accelerate CRs faster with a greater number of particles.\nHowever, two shocks with a same Mach number but with different shock speeds\nevolve qualitatively similarly when the results are presented in terms of\ndiffusion length and time scales. Therefore, the time asymptotic value for the\nfraction of shock kinetic energy transferred to CRs is mainly controlled by\nshock Mach number rather than shock speed. We present the ``CR energy ratio''\nfor a wide range of shock parameters and for $\\epsilon=0.2-0.3$ at terminal\ntime of our simulations. We suggest that these values can be considered as\ntime-asymptotic values for the CR acceleration efficiency, since the\ntime-dependent evolution of CR modified shocks has become approximately\nself-similar before the terminal time.",

    "summary": "The hydrodynamical modelling of Type II plateau supernova light curves\npredicts a correlation between three observable parameters (the plateau\nduration, the absolute magnitude and photospheric velocity at the middle of the\nplateau) on the one side and three physical parameters (the explosion energy E,\nthe mass of the envelope expelled M, and the presupernova radius R) on the\nother side. The correlation is used, together with adopted EPM distances, to\nestimate E, M, and R for a dozen of well-observed SNe IIP. For this set of\nsupernovae, the resulting value of E varies within a factor of 6 [0.5< E/(10^51\nerg)<3], whereas the envelope mass remains within the limits 10< M/M_sun <30.\nThe presupernova radius is typically (200-600)R_sun, but can exceed 1000R_sun\nfor the brightest supernovae (e.g., SN 1992am).\n  A new method of determining the distance of SNe IIP is proposed. It is based\non the assumption of a correlation between the explosion energy E and the Ni56\nmass required to power the post-plateau light curve tail through Co56 decay.\nThe method is useful for SNe IIP with well-observed bolometric light curves\nboth during the plateau and radioactive tail phases. The resulting distances\nand future improvements are discussed.",

The code is based on the Barnes-Hut algorithm and runs\ncosmological N-body simulations on parallel machines with a distributed memory\narchitecture using the MPI message-passing library. For a configuration with a\nconstant number of particles per processor the scalability of the code was\ntested up to P=128 processors on an IBM SP4 machine. In the large $P$ limit the\naverage CPU time per processor necessary for solving the gravitational\ninteractions is $\\sim 10 %$ higher than that expected from the ideal scaling\nrelation. The processor domains are determined every large timestep according\nto a recursive orthogonal bisection, using a weighting scheme which takes into\naccount the total particle computational load within the timestep. The results\nof the numerical tests show that the load balancing efficiency $L$ of the code\nis high ($>=90%$) up to P=32, and decreases to $L\\sim 80%$ when P=128. In the\nlatter case it is found that some aspects of the code performance are affected\nby machine hardware, while the proposed weighting scheme can achieve a load\nbalance as high as $L\\sim 90%$ even in the large $P$ limit.",

If the sky coverage allows the correlation functions\nto be estimated over the full range of angular separations, they can be\ninverted directly with integral transforms and clean separation of the electric\n(E) and magnetic (B) modes of polarization is obtained exactly in the mean. We\nassess the level of E-B mixing that arises from apodized integral transforms\nwhen the correlation function can only be estimated for a subset of angular\nscales, and show that it is significant for small-area observations. We\nintroduce new estimators to deal with this case on the spherical sky that\npreserve E-B separation; their construction requires an additional integration\nof the correlation functions but the computational cost is negligible. We\nillustrate our methods with application to a large-area survey with parameters\nsimilar to PLANCK, and the small-area Background Imaging of Cosmic\nExtragalactic Polarization experiment.

The equation has\na number of non-trivial analytical solutions whose existence rely on a delicate\nbalance between linear and non-linear terms. We formulate two classes of\nsecond-order accurate central-difference schemes, CFLN and MOL, for numerical\nintegration of this equation. Solutions produced by the schemes converge to\nexact solutions at any fixed time $t$ when numerical resolution is increased.\nHowever, in certain cases integration becomes asymptotically unstable when $t$\nis increased and resolution is kept fixed. This behavior is caused by subtle\nchanges in the balance between linear and non-linear terms when the equation is\ndiscretized. Changes in the balance occur without violating second-order\naccuracy of discretization. We thus demonstrate that a second-order accuracy\nand convergence at finite $t$ do not guarantee a correct asymptotic behavior\nand long-term numerical stability.\n  Accuracy and stability of integration are greatly improved by an exponential\ntransformation of the unknown variable.",

These observations resolve\nthe 7mm emission in approximately the north-south direction, confirming\nprevious results obtained with lower resolution. We use a two-layer flared disk\nmodel to interpret the observed fluxes from 7mm to 1.3mm together with the\nresolved 7mm structure. We find that the disk radius is constrained to the\nrange 100 to 300 AU, depending on the steepness of the disk surface density\ndistribution. The power law index of the dust opacity coefficient, beta, is\nconstrained to be 0.5 to 0.7. Since the models indicate that the disk is\noptically thin at millimeter wavelengths for radii greater than 8 AU, the\ncontribution of an optically thick region to the emission is less than 10%.\nThis implies that high optical depth or complex disk geometry cannot be the\ncause of the observed shallow millimeter spectral index. Instead, the new\nanalysis supports the earlier suggestion that dust particles in the disk have\ngrown to sizes as large as a few centimeters. The dust in the CQ Tauri system\nappears to be evolved much like that in the TW Hydra system, a well-studied\npre-main-sequence star of similar age and lower mass. The survival of gas-rich\ndisks with incomplete grain evolution at such old ages deserves further\ninvestigations.",

The\nspectrum is marked by a sharp drop in flux at 0.7 keV which has been\ninterpreted by Branduardi-Raymont et al. as the blue wing of a relativistic\nOVIII emission line and by Lee at al. as a dusty warm absorber. We find that\nthe drop is well explained by the FeI L2,3 absorption edges and obtain\nreasonable fits over the 0.32-1.7 keV band using a multizone, dusty warm\nabsorber model. Some residuals remain which could be due to emission from a\nrelativistic disc, but at a much weaker level than from any model relying on\nrelativistic emission lines alone. A model based on such emission lines can be\nmade to fit if sufficient (warm) absorption is added, although the line\nstrengths exceed those expected. The EPIC pn difference spectrum between the\nhighest and lowest flux states of the source indicates that this is a power-law\nin the 3-10 keV band which, if extrapolated to lower energies, reveals the\nabsorption function acting on the intrinsic spectrum, provided that any\nemission lines do not scale exactly with the continuum. We find that this\nfunction matches our dusty warm absorber model well. The soft X-ray spectrum is\ntherefore dominated by absorption structures, with the equivalent width of any\nindividual emission lines in the residuals being below about 30 eV. (abridged)",

This model is\nsupplemented with hybrid inflation and leptogenesis, but without taking the\nspecific details of these scenarios. It is shown that the Peccei-Quinn field\ncan successfully act as a curvaton generating the total curvature perturbation\nin the universe in accord with the cosmic background explorer measurements. A\ncrucial phenomenon, which assists us to achieve this, is the \"tachyonic\namplification\" of the perturbation acquired by this field during inflation if\nthe field, in its subsequent evolution, happens to be stabilized for a while\nnear a maximum of the potential. In this case, the contribution of the field to\nthe total energy density is also enhanced (\"tachyonic effect\"), which helps\ntoo. The cold dark matter in the universe consists, in this model, mainly of\naxions which carry an isocurvature perturbation uncorrelated with the total\ncurvature perturbation. There are also lightest sparticles (neutralinos) which,\nlike the baryons, originate from the inflationary reheating and, thus, acquire\nan isocurvature perturbation fully correlated with the curvature perturbation.\nSo, the overall isocurvature perturbation has a mixed correlation with the\nadiabatic one. It is shown that the presently available bound on such an\nisocurvature perturbation from cosmic microwave background radiation and other\ndata is satisfied. Also, the constraint on the non-Gaussianity of the curvature\nperturbation obtained from the recent Wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe data\nis fulfilled thanks to the \"tachyonic effect\".",

In contrast, for the Bloch\ntemperature region, the universality is only apparent, i.e. a\ncrossover-phenomenon, and simple scaling considerations with 'normal\ndimensions' apply.\n  However, due to interactions, the Bloch exponent e_B depends not only on the\ndimensionality d of the system, but also on the spin quantum number s (mod\n(1/2)) of the system, i.e. for given d the Bloch exponent e_B is different for\nhalf-integer s and for integer s.",

The spectra\ncover the rest-frame ultraviolet emission of the objects between lambda_rest ~\n1600A - 2800A. The Fe II emission-line complex at 2500A is clearly detected in\ntwo of the objects, and possibly detected in the third. The strength of this\ncomplex and the ratio of its integrated flux to that of Mg II lambda 2800 are\ncomparable to values measured for QSOs at lower redshifts, and are consistent\nwith Fe/Mg abundance ratios near or above the solar value. There thus appears\nto be no evolution of QSO metallicity to z~6. Our results suggest that massive,\nchemically enriched galaxies formed within 1 Gyr of the Big Bang. If this\nchemical enrichment was produced by Type Ia supernovae, then the progenitor\nstars formed at z ~ 20 +/- 10, in agreement with recent estimates based on the\ncosmic microwave background. These results also support models of an\nevolutionary link between star formation, the growth of supermassive black\nholes and nuclear activity.",

For\ninstance, this value may be set equal to the system's excess energy per\nparticle, in such way that the inserted particles are energetically\nindistinguishable from the other particles present. During the search for the\ninsertion site, the USHER algorithm uses a steepest descent iterator with a\ndisplacement whose magnitude is adapted to the local features of the energy\nlandscape. The only adjustable parameter in the algorithm is the maximum\ndisplacement and we show that its optimal value can be extracted from an\nanalysis of the structure of the potential energy landscape.

We have studied the magnetic properties of SmCo5 using\ndensity functional theory (DFT) calculations where the Sm f-bands, which are\ndifficult to include in DFT calculations, have been treated within the LDA+U\nformalism. The large MAE comes mostly from the Sm f-shell anisotropy, stemming\nfrom an interplay between the crystal field and the spin-orbit coupling.

In contrast\nto the case of charged scalars coupled to Abelian gauge fields that has been\nconsidered previously in the literature, the one-loop corrections are not\ndominated by a single 4D Kaluza-Klein mode. Nevertheless, in the case of gauge\nfield loops, the amplitudes can be reorganized into a leading logarithmic\ncontribution that is identical to the running in 4D non-Abelian gauge theory,\nand a term which is not logarithmically enhanced and is analogous to a two-loop\neffect in 4D.

Our analysis extends the Kramers theory\nof noise-induced transitions to the case when the system acted on by the noise\nhas nonzero spatial extent, and the noise itself is spatially dependent. By\nextending the Langer-Coleman theory of the noise-induced decay of a metastable\nstate, we determine the dependence of the activation barrier and the Kramers\nreversal rate prefactor on the size of the spatial domain. As this is increased\nfrom zero and passes through a certain critical value, a transition between\nactivation regimes occurs, at which the rate prefactor diverges. Beyond the\ntransition, reversal preferentially takes place in a spatially inhomogeneous\nrather than in a homogeneous way. Transitions of this sort were not discovered\nby Langer or Coleman, since they treated only the infinite-volume limit.

Effective, irreversible phase-damping of the\nsystem is obtained by applying an additional stochastic Hamiltonian on the\nenvironment alone, periodically redressing it and thereby irreversibliy\nrandomizing the system phase information that has leaked into the environment\nas a result of the coupling. This model is exactly solvable in the case of\nphase-damping, and we use this solution to describe the model's behavior in\nsome limiting cases. In the limit of small stochastic phase kicks the system's\ncoherence decays exponentially at a rate which increases linearly with the kick\nfrequency. In the case of strong kicks we observe an effective decoupling of\nthe system from the environment. We present a detailed implementation of the\nmethod on an nuclear magnetic resonance quantum information processor.",

A well developed physical\nunderstanding of type II supernovae allow them to be used to measure distances\nindependent of the extragalactic distance scale. Type Ia supernovae are\nempirical tools whose precision and intrinsic brightness make them sensitive\nprobes of the cosmological expansion. Both types of supernovae are consistent\nwith a Hubble Constant within ~10% of H_0 = 70 km/s/Mpc. Two teams have used\ntype Ia supernovae to trace the expansion of the Universe to a look-back time\nmore than 60% of the age of the Universe. These observations show an\naccelerating Universe which is currently best explained by a cosmological\nconstant or other form of dark energy with an equation of state near w = p/rho\n= -1. While there are many possible remaining systematic effects, none appears\nlarge enough to challenge these current results. Future experiments are planned\nto better characterize the equation of state of the dark energy leading to the\nobserved acceleration by observing hundreds or even thousands of objects. These\nexperiments will need to carefully control systematic errors to ensure future\nconclusions are not dominated by effects unrelated to cosmology.",

We present an HST I-band image of its\nnuclear region and Keck high-resolution (8 km/s) echelle spectra containing the\nCa II near-infrared triplet. In addition to the unresolved point source, there\nis a nuclear star cluster of size r ~ 3.9 pc; the upper limit on its velocity\ndispersion is only 30 km/s. We thus derive an upper limit of 6.2x10^6 solar\nmasses for the mass of the compact nucleus. Based on the amount of spatially\nresolved light in the HST image, a sizable fraction of this is likely to reside\nin stars. Hence, this estimate sets a stringent upper limit on the mass of the\ncentral black hole. We argue, from other lines of evidence, that the true mass\nof the black hole is likely to be 10^4-10^5 solar masses. Although the black\nhole is much less massive than those thought to exist in classical active\ngalactic nuclei, its accretion rate of L_bol/L_Edd ~ 2x10^-2 to 2x10^-3 is\nconsistent with the mass-luminosity relation obeyed by classical AGNs. This may\nexplain why NGC 4395 has a high-excitation (Seyfert) emission-line spectrum;\nactive galaxies having low-ionization spectra seem to accrete at significantly\nlower rates. NGC 4395, a pure disk galaxy, demonstrates that supermassive black\nholes are not associated exclusively with bulges.",

TP's are excellent probes of physics beyond the standard model\n(SM) for two reasons: (i) within the SM, most TP's are expected to be tiny, and\n(ii) unlike direct CP asymmetries, TP's are not suppressed by the small strong\nphases which are expected in B decays. TP's are obtained via the angular\nanalysis of B -> V1 V2. In a general analysis based on factorization, we\ndemonstrate that the most promising decays for measuring TP's in the SM involve\nexcited final-state vector mesons, and we provide estimates of such TP's. We\nfind that there are only a handful of decays in which large TP's are possible,\nand the size of these TP's depends strongly on the size of nonfactorizable\neffects. We show that TP's which vanish in the SM can be very large in models\nwith new physics. The measurement of a nonzero TP asymmetry in a decay where\nnone is expected would specifically point to new physics involving large\ncouplings to the right-handed b-quark.",

For\nexample, for any action of a countable group $\\Gamma$ on a topological manifold\nwhere the fixed sets for any element are contained in codimension two\nsubmanifolds, every orbit equivalence is equivariant. Even in the presence of\nlarger fixed sets, for actions preserving rigid geometric structures our\nresults force sufficiently smooth orbit equivalences to be equivariant. For\ninstance, if a countable group $\\Gamma$ acts on ${\\mathbb T}^n$ and the action\nis $C^1$ orbit equivalent to the standard action of $SL_n({\\mathbb Z})$ on\n${\\mathbb T}^n$, then $\\Gamma$ is isomorphic to $SL_n({\\mathbb Z})$ and the\nactions are isomorphic.

The half-opening angle of the disk is consistent\nwith zero within the measurement errors, and does not exceed 10 degrees. We\npropose that a recent burst of star formation has occurred in a dense gaseous\ndisk around Sgr A*.

The three-dimensional orbit of S2,\nthe young star closest to Sgr A*, has been recently mapped out with high\nprecision. It is inclined to the stellar disk by 75 degrees.

For that the flat direction energy\ndensity has to dominate the Universe at the time when it decays. We point out\nthat this is not possible if the inflaton decays into MSSM degrees of freedom.\nIf the inflaton is completely in the hidden sector, its decay products do not\ncouple to the flat direction, and the flat direction curvaton can dominate the\nenergy density. This requires the absence of a Hubble-induced mass for the\ncurvaton, e.g. by virtue of the Heisenberg symmetry. In the case of hidden\nradiation, $n=9$ is the only admissible direction; for other hidden equations\nof state, directions with lower $n$ may also dominate. We show that the MSSM\ncurvaton is further constrained severely by the damping of the fluctuations,\nand as an example, demonstrate that in no-scale supergravity it would fragment\ninto $Q$ balls rather than decay. Damping of fluctuations can be avoided by an\ninitial condition, which for the $n=9$ direction would require an initial\ncurvaton amplitude of $\\sim 10^{-2}M_p$, thereby providing a working example of\nthe MSSM flat direction curvaton.",

These abundances are\nsupplemented with echelle observations of another `double' damped Ly-alpha\nsystem in the literature. We propose a definition in terms of velocity shift of\nthe sub-class 'multiple damped Ly-alpha system', which is motivated by its\npossible connection with large-scale structure. We find that the abundance\nratio alpha/Fe is systematically low in multiple systems compared with single\nsystems, and with a small scatter. The same behavior is found in 2 more single\nDLA systems taken from the literature that show evidence of belonging to a\ngalaxy group. After a careful investigation of possible sources of systematic\nerrors, we conclude that the low alpha/Fe ratios in multiple DLAs have a\nnucleosynthetic origin. We suggest that they could be explained by reduced star\nformation in multiple damped Ly-alpha systems, possibly due to environmental\neffects.",

It can also be seen\nin the Knight shift, photoemission and tunneling experiments. In underdoped\nsamples it appears near room temperature and does not close with temperature.\nAnother related phenomenon that has been studied by infrared is the depression\nin the ab-plane scattering rate. Two separate effects can be discerned. At high\ntemperatures there is broad depression of scattering below 1000 cm-1 which may\nbe related to the gap in the density of states. At a lower temperature a\nsharper structure is seen, which appears to be associated with scattering from\na mode at 300 cm-1, and which governs the carrier life time at low\ntemperatures. This mode shows up in a number of other experiments, as a kink in\nARPES dispersion, and a resonance at 41 meV in magnetic neutron scattering.\nSince the infrared technique can be used on a wide range of samples it has\nprovided evidence that the scattering mode is present in all high temperature\ncuprates and that its frequency in optimally doped materials scales with the\nsuperconducting transition temperature.

    "summary": "We present results using 2-D spectral imagery and photometry obtained with\nthe Hubble Space Telescope (HST) for the starburst H II region, NGC 604, in\nnearby galaxy M33. The spectral imagery was acquired with the Space Telescope\nImaging Spectrograph (STIS) using the MAMA/G140L configuration, spanning\n1170-1730 A. From a single 1720 sec STIS exposure, we extracted spectra for 49\nstars and derived individual UV spectral types for 40 stars in the crowded\n25\"x2\" stellar field. These stars represent a significant fraction of the\nyoung, luminous O and B stars. Three objects have pronounced He II 1640\nemission, the signature of W-R or luminous Of stars. By combining UV fluxes\nwith WFPC and WFPC2 visual photometry, we derive the extinction curve for NGC\n604. We use this curve, the distance for M33, derived UV spectral types, and\nHST photometry, to determine positions of these stars in the upper H-R diagram.\nThe revised O star effective temperature scale (Martins et al.) is essential in\nobtaining reliable positions in the log(L*)-log(T(eff)) plane. These stars are\nquite young with an age of ~3 Myr. The spectra and photometry indicate three\nexceedingly luminous objects. Their inferred locations in the H-R diagram\nindicate stellar masses > 120 solar masses. High spatial resolution HST imagery\nprovides no evidence of multiple stars composing these objects. Still we cannot\neliminate the possibility that they are unresolved multiple stars of lower\nmass, possibly W-R stars. Tests demonstrate that the ten most luminous stars\npredominantly determine the UV spectral features seen in the total light of NGC\n604. We conclude that interpretation of spectral fitting of more distant\nstarburst galaxies, where individual stars are not resolved, must be done with\nextreme care.",

It is suggested that only the\nyoungest, most spatially compact, and energetic outflows have been found and\nthat more distributed high velocity gas undetected by BIMA is due to older\noutflows continuing through the Class I phase of protostellar evolution.

    "summary": "We present a global linear stability analysis of nuclear fuel accumulating on\nthe surface of an accreting neutron star and we identify the conditions under\nwhich thermonuclear bursts are triggered. The analysis reproduces all the\nrecognized regimes of hydrogen and helium bursts, and in addition shows that at\nhigh accretion rates, near the limit of stable burning, there is a regime of\n``delayed mixed bursts'' which is distinct from the more usual ``prompt mixed\nbursts.'' In delayed mixed bursts, a large fraction of the fuel is burned\nstably before the burst is triggered. Bursts thus have longer recurrence times,\nbut at the same time have somewhat smaller fluences. Therefore, the parameter\nalpha, which measures the ratio of the energy released via accretion to that\ngenerated through nuclear reactions in the burst, is up to an order of\nmagnitude larger than for prompt bursts. This increase in alpha near the\nthreshold of stable burning has been seen in observations. We explore a wide\nrange of mass accretion rates, neutron star radii and core temperatures, and\ncalculate a variety of burst properties. From a preliminary comparison with\ndata, we suggest that bursting neutron stars may have hot cores, with T_{core}\n>~ 10^{7.5} K, consistent with interior cooling via the modified URCA or\nsimilar low-efficiency process, rather than T_{core} ~ 10^7 K, as expected for\nthe direct URCA process. There is also an indication that neutron star radii\nare somewhat small <~ 10 km. Both of these conclusions need to be confirmed by\ncomparing more careful calculations with better data.",

It becomes nonlinear when the chemical potential difference\n$\\delta\\mu$, measuring the chemical imbalance in the fluid element, becomes\nlarger than the temperature $T$, which is generally much smaller than the Fermi\nenergy. From this scale on, the bulk viscosity increases much faster with\n$\\delta\\mu$ than predicted by the usual, linear approximation. This provides a\npotential saturation mechanism for stellar oscillation modes at a small to\nmoderate amplitude. In addition, bulk viscosity dissipates energy, which can\nlead to neutrino emission, reheating of the star, or both. This is the first\nstudy to explicitly consider these effects in the evolution of the r-mode\ninstability. For stars with little or no hyperon bulk viscosity, these effects\nare not strong enough to prevent the r-modes from growing to amplitudes\n$\\alpha\\sim 1$ or higher, so other saturation mechanisms will probably set in\nearlier. The reheating effect makes spin-down occur at a higher temperature\nthan would otherwise be the case, in this way possibly avoiding complications\nassociated with a solid crust or a core superfluid. On the other hand, stars\nwith a substantial hyperon bulk viscosity and a moderate magnetic field\nsaturate their mode amplitude at a low value, which makes them gravitational\nradiators for hundreds of years, while they lose angular momentum through\ngravitational waves and magnetic braking.",

After an introduction we discuss stellar evolution in binaries and\nthe processes involved in the mass-transfer phases of close binaries (RLO, CE,\nang.mom.loss) with radiative/convective hydrogen or helium donor stars. We also\ndescribe the effects of accretion, asymmetric SN and systems merging as a\nresult of gravitational wave radiation.",

The background charge fluctuations are an important dephasing\nprocess, especially in a charge qubit system. We examined the dephasing rate of\na qubit due to random telegraph noise. Solving stochastic differential\nequations, we obtained the dephasing rate of a qubit constructed of a\ncoupled-dot system; we applied our results to the charge Josephson qubit\nsystem. We examined the dephasing rates due to two types of couplings between\nthe coupled-dot system and the background charge, namely, fluctuation in the\ntunnel coupling constant and fluctuation in the asymmetric bias. For a strong\ncoupling condition, the dephasing rate was inversely proportional to the time\nconstant of the telegraph noise. When there is fluctuation in the tunnel\ncoupling constant, Gaussian decay occurs in the initial regime. We also\nexamined the rate of dephasing due to many impurity sites. For a weak coupling\ncondition with fluctuation in the asymmetric bias, the obtained dephasing rate\ncoincided with that obtained by the perturbation method using the spectral\nweight of a boson thermal bath, which is proportional to the inverse of the\nfrequency.",

The so-called connective constant,\n$\\mu = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} u_n/u_{n-1}$, which characterizes the long-distance\nbehavior of the walks, increases continuously with disorder strength (or\nrewiring probability, $p$). For small $p$, one has a linear relation $\\mu =\n\\mu_0 + a p$, $\\mu_0$ and $a$ being constants dependent on the underlying\nlattice. Close to $p = 1$ one finds the behavior expected for random graphs. An\nanalytical approach is given to account for the results derived from numerical\nsimulations. Both methods yield results agreeing with each other for small $p$,\nand differ for $p$ close to 1, because of the different connectivity\ndistributions resulting in both cases.",

Here we report the first results of such an\ninvestigation in which we have carried out time-dependent gas-phase chemistry\ncalculations in radiation hydrodynamical simulations of solar chromospheric\ndynamics. We show that while the ICE approximation turns out to be suitable for\nmodeling the observed infrared CO lines at the solar disk center, it may\nsubstantially overestimate the `heights of formation' of strong CO lines\nsynthesized close to the edge of the solar disk, especially concerning vigorous\ndynamic cases resulting from relatively strong photospheric disturbances. This\nhappens because during the cool phases of the hydrodynamical simulations the CO\nnumber density in the outer atmospheric regions is smaller than what is\nstipulated by the ICE approximation, resulting in decreased CO opacity in the\nsolar chromosphere. As a result, the cool CO-bearing gas which produces the\nobserved molecular lines must be located at atmospheric heights not greater\nthan 700 km, approximately. We conclude that taking into account the\nnon-equilibrium chemistry improves the agreement with the available on-disk and\noff-limb observations, but that the hydrodynamical simulation model has to be\neven cooler than anticipated by the ICE approximation, and this has to be the\ncase at the `new' (i.e. deeper) formation regions of the rovibrational CO\nlines.",

The vertical scaleheight of the cluster\nlayer at Galactocentric distances R_0-1 kpc < R_g< R_0+ 1 kpc varies\nnonmonotonically with age, exhibiting a wavelike pattern similar to the one\nearlier found for the Cepheid population (Joeveer 1974), with a period of P_Z =\n74 +/- 2 Myr and P_Z = 92 +/- 2 Myr if cluster ages are computed in terms of\nevolutionary models without and with overshooting, respectively. The period of\nvertical oscillations can be reconciled with the known local mass density only\nif cluster ages are computed with no or just mild overshooting: the\novershooting-based ages imply a local mass density of rho = 0.075 +/- 0.003\nM_Sun/pc^3, which is incompatibe with the recent Hipparcos-based estimate of\nrho = 0.102 M_Sun/pc^3 (Holmberg and Flynn 2000). Our results imply a maximum\nlocal dark-mass density of rho_DM <= 0.027 M_Sun/pc^3. At the time of their\nformation open clusters have, on the average, excess vertical kinetic energy\nand as a population are not in virial equilibrium; moreover, their initial\nvertical coordinates (at the time of birth) are strongly and positively\ncorrelated with initial vertical velocities (r = 0.81 +/-0.08), thus favoring a\nscenario where star formation in the disk is triggered by some massive objects\nfalling onto the Galactic plane.",

Strong differences between synthetic spectra from these\ncompared to observed spectra at energies higher than 54 eV (He II ground state)\ncan be ascribed to the neglect of metal-line blanketing.\n  Realistic modeling of the emergent fluxes of hot stars in the UV - X-ray\nwavelength range requires metal-line blanketed NLTE model atmospheres which\ninclude all elements from hydrogen up to the iron-group.

In cases\nwhere the targets move independently, each target can instead be tracked with a\nseparate filter. However, this leads to a model-data association problem.\nAnother approach to solve the problem with computational complexity is to track\nonly the first moment of the joint distribution, the probability hypothesis\ndensity (PHD). The integral of this distribution over any area S is the\nexpected number of targets within S. Since no record of object identity is\nkept, the model-data association problem is avoided.\n  The contribution of this paper is a particle filter implementation of the PHD\nfilter mentioned above. This PHD particle filter is applied to tracking of\nmultiple vehicles in terrain, a non-linear tracking problem. Experiments show\nthat the filter can track a changing number of vehicles robustly, achieving\nnear-real-time performance.",

    "summary": "The present paper contains two interrelated developments. First, are proposed\nnew generalized Verma modules. They are called k-Verma modules, k\\in N, and\ncoincide with the usual Verma modules for k=1. As a vector space a k-Verma\nmodule is isomorphic to the symmetric tensor product of k copies of the\nuniversal enveloping algebra U(g^-), where g^- is the subalgebra of lowering\ngenerators in the standard triangular decomposition of a simple Lie algebra g =\ng^+ \\oplus h \\oplus g^- . The second development is the proposal of a procedure\nfor the construction of multilinear intertwining differential operators for\nsemisimple Lie groups G . This procedure uses k-Verma modules and coincides for\nk=1 with a procedure for the construction of linear intertwining differential\noperators. For all k central role is played by the singular vectors of the\nk-Verma modules. Explicit formulae for series of such singular vectors are\ngiven. Using these are given explicitly many new examples of multilinear\nintertwining differential operators. In particular, for G = SL(2,R) are given\nexplicitly all bilinear intertwining differential operators. Using the latter,\nas an application are constructed (n/2)-differentials for all n\\in 2N, the\nordinary Schwarzian being the case n=4. As another application, in a Note Added\nwe propose a new hierarchy of nonlinear equations, the lowest member being the\nKdV equation.",

Our objective is\nto obtain spectroscopy in a very restricted wavelength range (~100 A in width)\nof several thousands of objects for each single 8x8 square arcmin field.\nApproximately 100 of them will be identified as cluster emission-line objects\nand will yield basic measurements of the dynamics and the star formation in the\ncluster (that figure applies to a cluster at z~0.50, and becomes ~40 and ~20\nfor clusters at z~0.75 and z~1.00 respectively).

The\nweakening of the intergrain region allowed the use of very small magnetic\nfields and currents to induce the resistive transition of the specimen and to\nobserve current noise. The induced noise is of the 1/f^2 type and will be\ninterpreted in terms of two different models. One of the model is based on the\nenhancement of the noise due to the clustering of the resistive transition of\nthe weak links, produced by correlation effects related to the strong\nnonlinearity of their Josephson type I-V characteristics. This model has been\nthe object of a computer simulation based on a 3D-network of Josephson-like\nelements and seems suitable to explain the noise produced by current variation.\nThe second model explains the excess noise as produced by discontinuous\npenetration of the magnetic flux inside the intergrain region. This\ndiscontinuity is related to the field screening effect of rings made of several\nsuperconducting weak links connecting different grains, which are alternatively\nbroken and restored by the current induced during flux variation, and seems\nsuitable to explain the larger noise produced by a varying magnetic field.",

The ratio of carbon to oxygen at the end of helium burning is\ncrucial for understanding the final fate of a progenitor star and the\nnucleosynthesis of heavy elements in Type II supernova, with oxygen rich star\npredicted to collapse to a black hole, and a carbon rich star to a neutron\nstar. Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa) are used as standard candles for measuring\ncosmological distances with the use of an empirical light curve-luminosity\nstretching factor. It is essential to understand helium burning that yields the\ncarbon/oxygen white dwarf and thus the initial stage of SNeIa. Since the triple\nalpha-particle capture reaction, $^{8}Be(\\alpha,\\gamma)^{12}C$, the first\nburning stage in helium burning, is well understood, one must extract the cross\nsection of the $^{12}C(\\alpha,\\gamma)^{16}O$ reaction at the Gamow window (300\nkeV) with high accuracy of approximately 10% or better. This goal has not been\nachieved despite repeated strong statements that appeared in the literature. In\nparticular constraint from the beta-delayed alpha-particle emission of $^{16}N$\nwere shown to not sufficiently restrict the p-wave cross section factor; e.g. a\nlow value of $S_{E1}(300)$ can not be ruled out.

    "summary": "We investigate the isometric transient response of muscle using a\nquantitative stochastic model of the actomyosin cycle based on the swinging\nlever-arm hypothesis. We first consider a single pair of filaments, and show\nthat when values of parameters such as the lever-arm displacement and the\ncrossbridge elasticity are chosen to provide effective energy transduction, the\nT2 curve (the tension recovered immediately after a step displacement) displays\na region of negative slope. If filament compliance and the discrete nature of\nthe binding sites are taken into account, the negative slope is diminished, but\nnot eliminated. This implies that there is an instability in the dynamics of\nindividual half-sarcomeres. However, when the symmetric nature of whole\nsarcomeres is taken into account, filament rearrangement becomes important\nduring the transient: as tension is recovered, some half-sarcomeres lengthen\nwhile others shorten. This leads to a flat T2 curve, as observed\nexperimentally. In addition, we investigate the isotonic transient response and\nshow that for a range of parameter values the model displays damped\noscillations, as recently observed in experiments on single muscle fibers. We\nconclude that it is essential to consider the collective dynamics of many\nsarcomeres, rather than the dynamics of a single pair of filaments, when\ninterpreting the transient response of muscle.",

The survey has discovered more than 600 new pulsars so\nfar, including many that are young and exotic. In this paper we report the\ndiscovery of 200 pulsars for which we present positional and spin-down\nparameters, dispersion measures, flux densities and pulse profiles. A large\nnumber of these new pulsars are young and energetic, and we review possible\nassociations of $\\gamma$-ray sources with the sample of about 1300 pulsars for\nwhich timing solutions are known. Based on a statistical analysis, we estimate\nthat about $19\\pm6$ associations are genuine. The survey has also discovered 12\npulsars with spin properties similar to those of the Vela pulsar, nearly\ndoubling the known population of such neutron stars. Studying the properties of\nall known `Vela-like' pulsars, we find their radio luminosities to be similar\nto normal pulsars, implying that they are very inefficient radio sources.\nFinally, we review the use of the newly discovered pulsars as Galactic probes\nand discuss the implications of the new NE2001 Galactic electron density model\nfor the determination of pulsar distances and luminosities.",

We proceed by listing the questions the theories are expected to be\nable to answer. We then compile two lists: the first details the actual results\nso far achieved in each theory, while the second lists conjectures which remain\nopen. By comparing them we can evaluate how far each theory has progressed, and\nwhat must still be done before each theory can be considered a satisfactory\nquantum theory of gravity. We find there has been impressive recent progress on\nseveral fronts. At the same time, important issues about loop quantum gravity\nare so far unresolved, as are key conjectures of string theory.

Our unification makes use of von Neumann's ergodic\ntheorem and avoids making any of the symmetry assumptions usually made in\ndiscussions of BB.

The Ly alpha and Ly beta troughs for SDSS J1030+0524\nare very black and show no evidence for any emission over a redshift interval\nof ~0.2 starting at z=6. On the other hand, SDSS J1148+5251 shows a number of\nemission peaks in the Ly beta Gunn-Peterson trough along with a single weak\npeak in the Ly alpha trough. The Ly alpha emission has corresponding Ly beta\nemission, suggesting that it is indeed a region of lower optical depth in the\nintergalactic medium at z=6.08.\n  The stronger Ly beta peaks in the spectrum of SDSS J1148+5251 could\nconceivably also be the result of \"leaks\" in the IGM, but we suggest that they\nare instead Ly alpha emission from an intervening galaxy at z=4.9. This\nhypothesis gains credence from a strong complex of C IV absorption at the same\nredshift and from the detection of continuum emission in the Ly alpha trough at\nthe expected brightness. If this proposal is correct, the quasar light has\nprobably been magnified through gravitational lensing by the intervening\ngalaxy. The Stromgren sphere observed in the absorption spectrum of SDSS\nJ1148+5251 is significantly smaller than expected based on its brightness,\nwhich is consistent with the hypothesis that the quasar is lensed.\n  If our argument for lensing is correct, the optical depths derived from the\ntroughs of SDSS J1148+5251 are only lower limits (albeit still quite strong,\nwith tau(LyA)>16 inferred from the Ly beta trough.) The Ly beta absorption\ntrough of SDSS J1030+0524 gives the single best measurement of the IGM\ntransmission at z>6, with an inferred optical depth tau(LyA)>22.",

Here, we explore the usefulness of the mid-UV for determining\nages and abundances of old populations. A mid-UV to optical/IR wavelength\nbaseline provides good separation of population components because the main\nsequence turnoff dominates the integrated light between 2500 and 4000 A. We\nfind a six magnitude difference in the mid-UV continuum level over the\nmetallicity range -1.5 < log Z/Z_o < +0.5 and a comparable difference (per unit\nlog t) for ages in the range 4-16 Gyr. Logarithmic derivatives of mid-UV colors\nwith respect to age or metal abundance are 3-10 times larger than for the UBV\nregion. Most of the spectral information on old populations therefore resides\nbelow 4000 A. We investigate the capability of UBV and mid-UV broad-band colors\nto separately determine age and abundance, taking into account precision in the\ncolor measurements. We find that the mid-UV improves resolution in (log t,log\nZ) space by about a factor of 3 for a given observational precision.\nContamination by hot horizontal branch phases can seriously affect mid-UV\nspectra, reaching over 80% in some cases. However, this is straightforward to\nremove as long as far-UV measurements are available. Finally, we show that a 4\nGyr, solar abundance model based on empirical spectra provides an excellent fit\nto the mid-UV spectrum of the E galaxy M32. This indicates that the poorer\nresults obtained from theoretical spectra arise from limitations of the\nsynthesis models for individual stars. [Condensed]",

To capture\nthe main features of the 2D melting transition and investigate the respective\nroles of these two classes of defects, we study a discrete elastic model\nconsisting of an array of nodes connected by springs, for which the relative\nnumber of geometrical defects (modeled as broken springs) and topological\ndefects (nodes having a coordination number different from 6) may be precisely\ncontrolled. We preform Monte Carlo simulations of this model in the\nisobaric-isothermal ensemble, and present the phase diagram as well as various\nthermodynamic, statistical and structural quantities as a function of the\nrelative populations of geometrical and topological defects. The model exhibits\na rich phase behavior including hexagonal and square crystals, expanded\ncrystal, dodecagonal quasicrystal, and liquid structure. We found that the\nsolid--liquid transition temperature is lowered by a factor 3 to 4, with\nrespect to the case when only topological defects are allowed, when both\ntopological and geometrical defects are permitted, supporting our hypothesis\nconcerning the central role played by the geometrical defects in the melting.\nThe microscopic structure of the dense liquid has been investigated and the\nresults are compared to those from simulations of 2D particle systems.",

    "summary": "We consider the motion of uncharged dust grains of arbitrary shape including\nthe effects of electromagnetic radiation and thermal emission. The resulting\nrelativistically covariant equation of motion is expressed in terms of standard\noptical parameters. Explicit expressions for secular changes of osculating\norbital elements are derived in detail for the special case of the\nPoynting-Robertson effect. Two subcases are considered: (i) central\nacceleration due to gravity and the radial component of radiation pressure\nindependent of the particle velocity, (ii) central acceleration given by\ngravity and the radiation force as the disturbing force. The latter case yields\nresults which may be compared with secular orbital evolution in terms of\norbital elements for an arbitrarily shaped dust particle. The effects of solar\nwind are also presented.",

This equation is special because the metric of\nthe space where it is written is influenced by the solution, rendering the\nequation recursive. The recursion mechanism is established via a first order\nequation which bears some resemblance to Dirac equation. In this paper the\nauthor limits the discussion to solutions with constant norm but makes use of\n4-dimensional hypercomplex numbers in matrix representation, a concept that is\nformally introduced in a section devoted to that aspect. The particular\nsolutions that are found exhibit symmetries that can be assigned to spin,\nelectric and color charges of elementary particles, leaving mass as a free\nparameter. Massless particles can also be assigned to special solutions of the\nsource equation, with the cases of photons, gluons and gravitons clearly\nidentified, together with another massless particle which does not seem to be\nrelated to anything detected experimentally. Another section deals with\nparticle dynamics under fields, showing that both gravitational and\nelectrodynamics can be modelled by geodesics of the spaces whose metric tensors\nresult from the recursion mechanism. Finally the author suggests two lines of\nfuture work, one deriving fields from densities and currents of masses and\ncharges and the other one aimed at determining particles' masses.",

Based on this data we argue that a\nsignificant fraction of Virgo cluster dEs recently underwent evolution. Our new\nobservations consist of HI 21-cm line observations for 22 classified dE\ngalaxies with optical radial velocities consistent with membership in the Virgo\ncluster. Cluster members VCC 390 and VCC 1713 are detected with HI masses M(HI)\n= 6*10^7 M_solar and 8*10^7 M_solar, respectively, while M(HI) in the remaining\n20 dE galaxies have upper limits as low as 5*10^5 M_solar. We combine our\nresults with those for 27 other Virgo cluster dEs with HI observations in the\nliterature, 7 of which have HI detection claims. New optical images from the\nWIYN telescope of 5 of these HI-detected dEs, along with archival data, suggest\nthat seven of the claimed detections are real, yielding a ~ 15% detection rate.\nThese HI-detected classified dEs are preferentially located near the periphery\nof the Virgo cluster. Three Virgo dEs have observed HI velocity widths > 200\nkm/s, possibly indicating the presence of a large dark matter content, or\ntransient extended HI. We discuss the possible origins of these objects and\nargue that they originate from field galaxies accreted onto high angular\nmomentum orbits by Virgo in the last few Gyr. As a result these galaxies are\nslowly transformed within the cluster by gradual gas stripping processes,\nassociated truncation of star formation, and passive fading of stellar\npopulations. Low-mass early-type cluster galaxies are therefore currently being\nproduced as the product of cluster environmental effects. We utilize our\nresults to estimate the recent (past 1-3 Gyr) average mass accretion rate into\nthe Virgo cluster, finding dM/dt ~ 50 M_solar/year.",

The diffusion coefficient is calculated using the following PO formulas:\n(a) The curvature expansion of the Ruelle zeta function. (b) The average of the\nPO winding-number squared, $w^{2}$, weighted by a stability factor. (c) The\nuniform (nonweighted) average of $w^{2}$. The results from formulas (a) and (b)\nagree very well with those obtained by standard methods, for all the\nperturbation parameters considered. Formula (c) gives reasonably accurate\nresults for sufficiently small parameters corresponding also to cases of a\nconsiderably nonuniform hyperbolicity. This is due to {\\em uniformity sum\nrules} satisfied by the PO Lyapunov eigenvalues at {\\em fixed} $w$.

General possibilities for multiplication rules and\ncoupling constants are simultaneously accommodated by regarding the set of\nfields equivalently as a single algebra-valued spin-2 field and single\nalgebra-valued spin-3/2 field, where the underlying algebra is factorized into\na field-coupling part and an internal multiplication part. The condition that\nthere exist a gauge invariant Lagrangian (to within a divergence) for these\nalgebra-valued fields is used to derive determining equations whose solutions\ngive all allowed deformation terms, yielding nonlinear field equations and\nnonabelian gauge symmetries, together with all allowed formal multiplication\nrules as needed in the Lagrangian for demonstration of invariance under the\ngauge symmetries and for derivation of the field equations. In the case of\nspin-2 fields alone, the main result of this analysis is that all deformations\n(without any higher derivatives than appear in the linear theory) are\nequivalent to an algebra-valued Einstein gravity theory. By a systematic\nexamination of factorizations of the algebra, a novel type of nonlinear gauge\ntheory of two or more spin-2 fields is found, where the coupling for the fields\nis based on structure constants of an anticommutative, anti-associative\nalgebra, and with formal multiplication rules that make the fields\nanticommuting (while products obey anti-associativity). Supersymmetric\nextensions of these results are obtained in the more general case when spin-3/2\nfields are included.",

Results from the literature either\nderived for objects in the Hyades and the UMa cluster or from the Hipparcos\nmission contradict each other. A way out of this dilemma is to investigate\nyoung open clusters with known ages and accurate distances (error < 10%),\nincluding CP2 members. Up to now, four open clusters fulfill these\nrequirements: IC 2391, IC 2602, NGC 2451A and NGC 2516. In total, 13 CP2 stars\ncan be found within these clusters. We have used the measurements and\ncalibrations of the Geneva 7-color photometric system to derive effective\ntemperatures and luminosities. Taking into account the overall metallicity of\nthe individual clusters, isochrones and evolutionary tracks were used to\nestimate ages and masses for the individual objects. The derived ages (between\n10 and 140 Myr) are well in line with those of the corresponding clusters and\nfurther strengthen the membership of the investigated CP2 stars.",

We show that a number of \"bottom--light\" IMFs\n(namely, with less mass locked in low-mass stars than the standard Salpeter\nIMF), suggested independently in recent literature, do imply M/L ratios as low\nas mentioned above, at least for late type spirals (Sbc/Sc). This conclusion\nstill holds when the bulge contribution to mass and light is included. We also\npredict the typical stellar M/L ratio, and correspondingly the zero-point of\nthe Tully-Fisher relation, to vary considerably with Hubble type (about 0.5-0.7\nmag in the red bands, from Sa to Sc type).\n  For some of the bottom-light IMFs considered, the efficiency of metal\nproduction tends to exceed what is typically estimated for spiral galaxies.\nSuitable tuning of the IMF mass limits, post-supernova fallback of metals onto\nblack holes or metal outflows must then be invoked, to reproduce the observed\nchemical properties of disc galaxies.\n  In the appendix we provide M/L-colour relations to estimate the stellar M/L\nratio of a galaxy on the base of its colours, for several IMFs.",

We investigate how rapidly this transition can take place, by\nimplementing into a global MHD model, that uses a thermodynamic description of\nthe plasma, explicit, physically motivated prescriptions for the dissipation\nrate: a lower limit on this rate is given by limiting the maximum drift speed\nof the current carriers to that of light, an upper limit follows from demanding\nthat the dissipation zone expand only subsonically in the comoving frame and a\nfurther prescription is obtained by assuming that the expansion speed is\nlimited by the growth rate of the relativistic tearing mode.

The approach\ncarries no connotation of unlimited repeatability; hence it can be applied to\nunique systems such as the universe.\n  Consistent experiments provide an elegant solution to the reality problem,\nconfirming the insistence of the orthodox Copenhagen interpretation on that\nthere is nothing but ensembles, while avoiding its elusive reality picture.

In this work we consider a many parameter family of\nsymmetric hyperbolic initial-boundary value formulations for the linearized\nEinstein equations and analyze its well posedness using the Laplace-Fourier\ntechnique. By using this technique ill posed modes can be detected and thus a\nnecessary condition for well posedness is provided. We focus on the following\ntypes of boundary conditions: i) Boundary conditions that have been shown to\npreserve the constraints, ii) boundary conditions that result from setting the\ningoing constraint characteristic fields to zero and iii) boundary conditions\nthat result from considering the projection of Einstein's equations along the\nnormal to the boundary surface. While we show that in case i) there are no ill\nposed modes, our analysis reveals that, unless the parameters in the\nformulation are chosen with care, there exist ill posed constraint violating\nmodes in the remaining cases.",

The rotation periods span more than an order of magnitude in period,\nwith most falling between 1 and 10 days. Thus the broad rotation period\ndistributions found in 100 Myr clusters are already established by an age of 1\nMyr. The most rapidly rotating stars are within a factor of 2-3 of their\ncritical velocities; if angular momentum is conserved as they evolve to the\nZAMS, these stars may come to exceed their critical velocities. Extensive\nefforts have been made to find connections between stellar rotation and the\npresence of protostellar disks; at best only a weak correlation has been found\nin the largest samples. Magnetic disk-locking is a theoretically attractive\nmechanism for angular momentum evolution of young stars, but the links between\ntheoretical predictions and observational evidence remain ambiguous.

The resulting values are found ~5 times larger than the\nvalues resulting from a computation in which convective velocities and entropy\nfluctuations are obtained with a 1D solar envelope model built with the\ntime-dependent, nonlocal Gough (1977) extension of the mixing length\nformulation for convection (GMLT). This difference is mainly due to the assumed\nmean anisotropy properties of the velocity field in the excitation region. The\n3D simulation suggests much larger horizontal velocities compared to vertical\nones than in the 1D GMLT solar model. The values of P obtained with the 3D\nsimulation constraints however are still too small compared with the values\ninferred from solar observations. Improvements in the description of the\nturbulent kinetic energy spectrum and its depth dependence yield further\nincreased theoretical values of P which bring them closer to the observations.\nIt is also found that the source of excitation arising from the advection of\nthe turbulent fluctuations of entropy by the turbulent movements contributes ~\n65-75 % to the excitation and therefore remains dominant over the Reynolds\nstress contribution. The derived theoretical values of P obtained with the 3D\nsimulation constraints remain smaller by a factor ~3 compared with the solar\nobservations. This shows that the stochastic excitation model still needs to be\nimproved.",

This annual effect can only\nbe explained if the variations are caused by a propagation effect, and thus\naffected by the Earth's relative speed through the projected intensity pattern.\nTo account for this effect, the scattering plasma must have a transverse\nvelocity with respect to the local standard of rest.\n  The velocity calculated from these observations is in good agreement with\nthat obtained from a two telescope delay experiment (Dennett-Thorpe & de Bruyn\n2001). We also show that either the source itself is elongated, or that the\nscattering plasma is anisotropic, with an axial ratio of >6:1. As the source is\nextended on scales relevant to the scattering phenomenon, it seems plausible\nthat the anisotropy is due to the source itself, but this remains to be\ninvestigated. From the scintillation characteristics we find that the\nscattering material is a very strong, thin scatterer within ~ten parsecs.

As usual, the ultrahigh energy protons with\nenergies above E_{GZK} ~ 4 x 10^{19} eV loose a large fraction of their\nenergies by the photoproduction of pions on the cosmic microwave background,\nwhich finally decay mainly into neutrinos. In our scenario, these so-called\ncosmogenic neutrinos interact with nucleons in the atmosphere through Standard\nModel electroweak instanton-induced processes and produce air showers which are\nhardly distinguishable from ordinary hadron-initiated air showers. In this way,\nthey give rise to a second contribution to the observed cosmic ray spectrum --\nin addition to the one from above mentioned protons -- which reaches beyond\nE_{GZK}. Since the whole observed spectrum is uniquely determined by a single\nprimary injection spectrum, no fine tuning is needed to fix the ratio of the\nspectra below and above E_{GZK}.

We consider a $^{1}S_{0}$ -\n$^{1}S_{0}$ transition, with excitation in near resonance with the $^{1}P_{1}$\nlevel. This greatly increases the two-photon transition rate, allowing an\neffective transfer of momentum. The experimental implementation of this\ntechnique is discussed and we show that for Calcium, for example, two-photon\ncooling can be used to achieve a Doppler limit of 123 microKelvin.

Each of the fields was imaged by the\nWFPC2 aboard the {\\it Hubble Space Telescope} and were used to obtain $VI$\ncolor-magnitude diagrams for each field reaching $V\\simeq26$. The magnitude of\nthe tip of the red giant branch and the red clump were used to determine\ndistances to NGC 6822 that are consistent with previous ground-based\nmeasurements. The distance, extinction and star formation history were also\ndetermined by fitting the entire color-magnitude diagram in each field. The\ndistances from these fits are consistent with the other determinations within\nthe estimated errors once the systematic effects of uncertainties in the\nage-metallicity relation are taken into account. The extinction varies among\nthe four fields from approximately the foreground Galactic value to $\\approx\n0.4$ mag higher in $V$ and roughly correlates with the $60\\micron$ surface\nbrightness. The star formation histories in the four fields are similar for\nages $\\gtrsim 1$ Gyr and are relatively constant or somewhat increasing with\ntime. These old star formation rates are comparable to that expected from the\ntypical gas surface densities at these galactocentric radii and suggest that no\nlarge scale redistribution of gas or stars is required to account for the\ninferred star formation rates. Three of the fields show a drop of a factor of\n$\\sim 2-4$ in the star formation rate about 600 Myr ago while the remaining\nfield centered on the bar shows an increase.",

Approximation #1\nconsists of replacing the full, angular- dependent, distribution function by a\ntwo-stream simulation, where the streams are respectively outwardly and\ninwardly directed, with angles $\\cos \\theta=\\pm 1/\\sqrt{3}$ to the vertical. In\nthis approximation the full energy dependence of the distribution function is\nretained, as are the energy and temperature dependences of the scattering\nrates. Approximation #2, used in recent works on the subject, replaces the\ndistribution function by an intensity function and the scattering rates by\ntemperature-energy-averaged quantities. We compare the approximations to the\nresults of solving the full Boltzmann equation. Under some interesting\nconditions, approximation #1 passes the test; approximation #2 does not. We\nutilize the results of our analysis to construct a toy model of a disc at a\ntemperature and density such that relativistic particles are more abundant than\nnucleons, and dominate both the opacity and pressure. The nucleons will still\nprovide most of the energy density. In the toy model we take the rate of heat\ngeneration (which drives the radiative transfer problem) to be proportional to\nthe nucleon density. The model allows the simultaneous solution of the neutrino\ntransport and hydrostatic equilibrium problems in a disk in which the nucleon\ndensity decreases approximately linearly as one moves from the median plane of\nthe disk upwards, reaching zero on the upper boundary.",

    "summary": "(Abridged) Many dwarf galaxies exhibit sub-Solar metallicities, with some\nstar-to-star variation, despite often containing multiple generations of stars.\nThe total metal content in these systems is much less than expected from the\nheavy element production of massive stars in each episode of star formation.\nSuch a deficiency implies that a substantial fraction of the enriched material\nhas been lost from these small galaxies. Mass ejection from dwarf galaxies may\nhave important consequences for the evolution of the intergalactic medium and\nfor the evolution of massive galaxies, which themselves may have formed via the\nmerger of smaller systems. We report here the results of three-dimensional\nsimulations of the evolution of supernova-enriched gas within dwarf spheroidal\ngalaxies (dSph's), with the aim of determining the retention efficiency of\nsupernova ejecta. We consider two galaxy models, selected to represent opposite\nends of the dSph sequence. For each model galaxy we investigate a number of\nscenarios, ranging from a single supernova in smooth gas distributions to more\ncomplex multiple supernovae in highly disturbed gas distributions. The results\nof these investigations suggest that, for low star-formation efficiencies, it\nis difficult to completely expel the enriched material from the galaxy. Most of\nthe enriched gas is, however, lost from the core of the galaxy following\nmultiple supernovae, especially if the interstellar medium is already highly\ndisturbed by processes such as photo-ionization and stellar winds. If\nsubsequent star formation occurs predominantly within the core where most of\nthe residual gas is concentrated, then these results could explain the poor\nself-enrichment efficiency observed in dwarf galaxies.",

This study was incidental to the main program and so not\nexhaustive but the small value of $\\sigma_{RV}$ implies that the fiber\nfeed/image slicer system on Gecko + CAFE, essentially eliminates the long\nstanding problem of guiding errors in radial velocity measurements. We are not\nsuggesting this conventional approach for serious Doppler planet searches\n(especially with Gecko which has such a small multiplex gain), but the\nprecision is valuable for observations made in spectral regions remote from\ntelluric lines or captive-gas fiducials.

It is also our primary window\nto unknown physics during the inflationary era. Using a power-law form for the\nprimordial power spectrum $P_{in}(k)$ and constraining the scalar spectral\nindex and its running, \\cite{Peiris03} found that the first year WMAP data seem\nto indicate a preferred scale in $P_{in}(k)$. We use two complementary methods:\nthe wavelet band powers method of \\cite{pia1}, and the top-hat binning method\nof \\cite{Wang99} to reconstruct $P_{in}(k)$ as a free function from CMB data\nalone (WMAP, CBI, and ACBAR), or from CMB data together with large scale\nstructure data (2dFGRS and PCSZ). The shape of the reconstructed $P_{in}(k)$ is\nconsistent with scale-invariance, although it allows some indication of a\npreferred scale at $k \\sim 0.01$Mpc$^{-1}$. While consistent with the possible\nevidence for a running of the scalar spectral index found by the WMAP team, our\nresults highlight the need of more stringent and independent constraints on\ncosmological parameters (the Hubble constant in particular) in order to more\ndefinitively constrain deviations of $P_{in}(k)$ from scale-invariance without\nmaking assumptions about the inflationary model.",

The 1.1-2.2 um data of NGC 4418 show no clear\nevidence of nuclear star clusters or of a reddened active galactic nucleus.\nInstead, the nucleus of the galaxy consists of a ~100-200 pc linear structure\nwith fainter structures extending radially outward. The near-infrared colors of\nthe linear feature are consistent with a 10-300 Myr starburst suffering\nmoderate levels (few magnitudes) of visual extinction. At 7.9-24.5 um, NGC 4418\nhas estimated size upper limits in the range of 30-80 pc.

During the self-detuning cycle new and\nnew narrow phonon modes are sequentially ``fired'' on one side of the spectrum\nand approximately the same number of modes are ``extinguished'' on the other\nside, up to a complete generation breakdown in a certain final portion of the\nfrequency axis. This is usually followed by a short-time refractority, after\nwhich the generation is fired again in the opposite (starting) portion of the\nfrequency axis. The entire process of such cooperative spectral motions is\nrepeated with high degree of regularity. The self-detuning period strongly\ndepends on difference between the modulation frequency and the resonance\nfrequency. This period is incommensurable with period of modulation. It\nincreases to very large values (more than 100 s) when pointed difference is\nless than 0.05 Hz. The revealed phenomenon is a kind of global spin-phonon\nself- organization.

The\ngeneral self-similar solutions which describe a resistive and {\\it nonrotating}\nflow with purely poloidal magnetic field is first introduced. The radial\ndependence of physical quantities is identical to viscous ADAF solutions.\nAlthough the main focus of this study is nonrotating magnetized accretion flow,\nfor rotating flow with both poloidal and toroidal components of magnetic field\nwe find the radial scaling of solutions similar to the nonrotating case. We\nshow that the accretion and the rotation velocities are both below the\nKeplerian rate, irrespective of the amount of cooling. We show that the set of\nthe equations is reduced to a second order differential equation for a\nnonrotating flow. The geometrical shape of the disk changes depending on the\nfraction of the resistively dissipated energy which is stored in the accreting\ngas. However, there is a hot low-density gas above the disk in almost all\ncases. The net accretion rate is calculated for a set of illustrative\nparameters.",

From the knowledge of the\nenergy and disorder dependence of the localization length and the density of\nstates (DOS) of the corresponding Landau bands, the movement of the current\ncarrying states in the disorder--energy and disorder--filling-factor plane can\nbe traced by tuning the disorder strength.\n  We show results for all sub-bands, particularly the traces of the Chern and\nanti-Chern states as well as the peak positions of the DOS. For small disorder\nstrength $W$ we recover the well known weak levitation of the critical states,\nbut we also reveal, for larger $W$, the strong levitation of these states\nacross the Landau gaps without merging. We find the behavior to be similar for\nexponentially, Gaussian, and Lorentzian correlated disorder potentials. Our\nstudy resolves the discrepancies of previously published work in demonstrating\nthe conflicting results to be only special cases of a general lattice model\nwith spatially correlated disorder potentials.\n  To test whether the mixing between consecutive Landau bands is the origin of\nthe observed floating, we truncate the Hilbert space of our model Hamiltonian\nand calculate the behavior of the current carrying states under these\nrestricted conditions.",

We have developed a synthetic photometric\nsystem which can be used to explore the capability of model atmospheres with\nindividual element abundances to predict photometric Delta a magnitudes which\nmeasure the extent of the flux depression around 5200A found in different types\nof CP stars. In this first paper, we confirm the observed dependency of the\na-index as a function of various colour indices sensitive to the effective\ntemperature of stars as well as its average scatter expected from surface\ngravity variations within the main sequence band. The behaviour of the\nso-called normality line of Delta a systems used in photometric observations of\nCP stars is well reproduced. The metallicity dependence of the normality line\nof the Delta a system was computed for several grids of model atmospheres where\nthe abundances of elements heavier than He had been scaled +-0.5 dex with\nrespect to the solar value. We estimate a lowering of Delta a magnitudes for CP\nstars within the Magellanic Clouds by approximately -3 mmag relative to those\nin the solar neighbourhood assuming an average metallicity of [Fe/H]= -0.5 dex.\nUsing these results on the metallicity bias of the Delta a system we find the\nobservational systems in use suitable to identify CP stars in other galaxies or\ndistant regions of our own galaxy and capable to provide data samples on a\nstatistically meaningful basis. In turn, the synthetic system is suitable to\ntest the performance of model atmospheres for CP stars. This work will be\npresented in follow-up papers of this series.",

The discovery and observations of GRB\nafterglows and the identification of host galaxies have allowed comparisons of\ntheoretical distributions of merger sites with the observed distribution of\nafterglow positions relative to host galaxies. To help investigate the physical\nnature of short- and long-duration GRBs, we compute the distances of merging\nneutron stars (NS) and/or black holes (BH) from the centers of their host\ngalaxies, as predicted by their formation scenario combined with motion in\ngalactic potentials.

The models are the mean-field XY\nmodel and the one-dimensional XY model with nearest-neighbor interactions. The\nformer model undergoes a second-order phase transition at a finite critical\ntemperature while the latter has no phase transitions. The computation of this\ntopologic invariant is performed within the framework of Morse theory. In both\nmodels topology changes in configuration space are present as the potential\nenergy is varied; however, in the mean-field model there is a particularly\n\"strong\" topology change, corresponding to a big jump in the Euler\ncharacteristic, connected with the phase transition, which is absent in the\none-dimensional model with no phase transition. The comparison between the two\nmodels has two major consequences: i) it lends new and strong support to a\nrecently proposed topological approach to the study of phase transitions; ii)\nit allows us to conjecture which particular topology changes could entail a\nphase transition in general. We also discuss a simplified illustrative model of\nthe topology changes connected to phase transitions using of two-dimensional\nsurfaces, and a possible direct connection between topological invariants and\nthermodynamic quantities.",

The remnant\nis detected in J, H, and Ks bands, with Ks band brightest and J faint. In the J\nand H bands, bright [Fe II] lines (1.24um and 1.64um) are detected\nspectroscopically. The Palomar observations include Ks continuum, narrow-band\n1.64um (centered on [Fe II]) and 2.12um (centered on H2(1-0)) images. While the\nnarrow-band 1.64um image shows filamentary and knotty structures, similar to\nthe optical image, the Ks image shows a relatively smooth, diffuse shell,\nremarkably similar to the radio image. The broad-band near-infrared fluxes of\nCas A are generally consistent with, but a few tens of percent higher than, an\nextrapolation of the radio fluxes. The hardening to higher frequencies is\npossibly due to nonlinear shock acceleration and/or spectral index variation\nacross the remnant. We show evidence of spectral index variation. The presence\nof near-infrared synchrotron radiation requires the roll-off frequency to be\nhigher than 1.5e14 Hz, implying that electrons are accelerated to energies of\nat least 0.2 TeV.

Combined with published data,\nthey bring the total number of GCs with measured radial velocities in this\ngalaxy to 263. Using this sample, we extract the projected kinematics of the\nfull sample of GCs, and of the separate metal-poor and metal-rich subsamples.\nIn agreement with previous results for the global GC kinematics based on\nsmaller datasets, we find that the GC system as a whole exhibits a slow overall\nrotation that is due almost entirely to a net rotation of the metal-poor GC\nsubsystem alone. In a spatial average, the metal-rich GCs shows essentially no\nrotation. We note, however, the presence of a well defined grouping of 10\nmetal-rich GCs that are located at opposite poles along the galaxy's major axis\nand which appear to be rotating at nearly 300 km/s about the minor axis. This\ngrouping may be the relic of a past merger or accretion event. Using a\nJeans-equation analysis, we show that the GC radial velocities alone point\nunequivocally (and independently of X-ray observations) to the need for a\nmassive dark halo associated with M49 and the Virgo B subcluster around it. We\nalso show that the GC system as a whole is consistent with an almost perfectly\nisotropic velocity ellipsoid. M49 is now the second elliptical galaxy (after\nM87) for which we have been able to demonstrate velocity isotropy in the\nglobular cluster system overall, when no division based on GC color or\nmetallicity is attempted. Thus, the data for these two galaxies lend support\nthe general assumption of isotropy when using GC kinematics to study the\ndark-matter distribution in early-type galaxies. (ABRIDGED)",

The required spectral\nproperties are related to the return probability of a \"blind ant\"-random walk\non the critical percolating cluster. The resulting scaling relations express\nthe critical exponents of the shear-stress-relaxation function, and hence those\nof the shear viscosity and of the first normal stress coefficient, in terms of\nthe spectral dimension $d_{s}$ of the critical percolating cluster and the\nexponents $\\sigma$ and $\\tau$ of the cluster-size distribution.",

From the high-resolution spectra, the following\natmospheric parameters were determined: $T_{\\rm eff}$ = 6900 K, log$g$ = 1.0\nand $\\xi_{\\rm t}$ = 4.5. Abundance analysis shows that IRAS 06530$-$0213 is\nmetal-poor ([Fe/H]=$-$0.9) and overabundant in carbon ([C/Fe]=1.3), nitrogen\n([N/Fe]=1.0), and s-process elements ([s-process/Fe]=1.9), indicating AGB\nnucleosynthesis and deep convective mixing. From the analysis of circumstellar\nC$_{2}$ and CN molecular bands in the spectrum of IRAS 06530$-$0213, an\nenvelope expansion velocity of V$_{\\rm exp}$=~14$\\pm1$ km s$^{-1}$ was\ndetermined, a typical value for post-AGB stars.

Here we perform a more focused analysis of the Thomson optical depth in\nlight of the WMAP observations. While the current uncertainties on the observed\nThomson optical depth are still relatively large, with tau_e=0.17+-0.04 (68%)\n(Kogut et al 2003), important implications on Pop III star formation processes\nat high redshift can already be inferred. We are able to draw four conclusions:\n(1) in the absence of a top-heavy initial stellar mass function (IMF) for Pop\nIII metal-free stars and without a dramatic upturn in the star formation\nefficiency and ionizing photon escape fraction at high redshift (z>6), we find\ntau_e =< 0.09; (2) with a top-heavy IMF for the Pop III metal-free stars and\nplausible star formation efficiency and ionizing photon escape fraction, it is\nexpected that tau_e =< 0.12; (3) it is possible to reach tau_e = 0.15, if the\nmetal enrichment efficiency of the intergalactic medium by Pop III stars is\nvery low thus Pop III era is prolonged; (4) to reach tau_e >= 0.17 requires\neither of the following two conditions: the cosmological model power index n is\npositively tilted to n >= 1.03, Pop III star formation in minihalos with\nmolecular hydrogen cooling has an efficiency c_*(H_2,III)>0.01 (with ionizing\nphoton escape fraction greater than 30%). If the current observed value of\nThomson optical depth withstands future data, we will have strong observational\nevidence that Pop III stars are massive and their formation efficiency may be\nmuch higher than current theoretical works suggest.

It is essential to realize that\nall physical processes that contribute operate on different time scales. In\nparticular detailed balancing is often violated since the statistically inverse\nprocess of e.g. collisional ionization is recombination of an ion with two\nelectrons, which as a three-body collision is usually dominated by radiative\nrecombination, causing a departure from collisional ionization equilibrium. On\ntop of these differences in atomic time scales, hot plasmas are often in a\ndynamical state, thereby introducing another time scale, which can be the\nshortest one. The non-equilibrium effects will be illustrated and discussed in\nthe case of galactic outflows. It will be shown, that spectral analyses of\nX-ray data of edge-on galaxies show a clear signature in the form of\n\"multi-temperature\" halos, which can most naturally be explained by the\n\"freezing-in\" of highly ionized species in the outflow, which contribute to the\noverall spectrum by DELAYED RECOMBINATION. This naturally leads to a\nnon-equilibrium cooling function, which modifies the dynamics, which in turn\nchanges the plasma densities and thermal energy budget, thus feeding back on\nthe ionization structure. Therefore SELF-CONSISTENT modelling is needed.",

    "summary": "The application of a magnetic field along the [111] direction in the spin ice\ncompounds leads to two magnetization plateaux, in the first of which the ground\nstate entropy is reduced but still remains extensive. We observe that under\nreasonable assumptions, the remaining degrees of freedom in the low field\nplateau live on decoupled kagome planes, and can be mapped to hard core dimers\non a honeycomb lattice. The resulting two dimensional state is critical, and we\nhave obtained its residual entropy -- in good agreement with a recent\nexperiments -- the equal time spin correlations as well as a theory for the\ndynamical spin correlations. Small tilts of the field are predicted to lead a\nvanishing of the entropy and the termination of the critical phase by a\nKasteleyn transition characterized by highly anisotropic scaling. We discuss\nthe thermally excited defects that terminate the plateau either end, among them\nan exotic string defect which restores three dimensionality.",

The behavior of various collisionless\ngalaxy models is studied both in isolation and in the presence of a large\nperturbing satellite. We also consider models with a dominant gaseous component\nin the disk. We find that in general bar formation requires disk masses at\nleast a factor of 2 higher than those inferred for LSBs under the assumption of\na normal stellar mass-to-light ratio. Low surface density stellar disks\ncontributing less than 10% of the total virial mass are stable within NFW halos\nspanning a range of concentrations. However, a purely gaseous disk can form a\nbar even for quite low masses and for realistic temperatures provided that\ncooling is very efficient (we adopt an isothermal equation of state) and that\nthe halo has a very low concentration, c < 5. The bars that form in these LSB\nmodels are shorter than the typical halo scale radius - their overall angular\nmomentum content might be too low to affect significantly the inner dark halo\nstructure. Once formed, all the bars evolve into bulge-like structures in a few\nGyr and can excite spiral patterns in the surrounding disk component. The\nrecently discovered red LSBs show significant non-axisymmetric structure and\nbulge-like components and share many of their structural properties with the\nfinal states of our LSB models with massive disks. Our results imply that a\nbulge-like component must be present in any low surface brightness galaxy that\never went bar unstable in the past.",

    "summary": "One of the most puzzling properties of observed galaxies is the universality\nof the empirical correlation between the star formation rate and average gas\nsurface density on kiloparsec scales (the Schmidt law). In this study I present\nresults of self-consistent cosmological simulations of high-redshift galaxy\nformation that reproduce the Schmidt law naturally, without assuming it, and\nprovide some clues to this puzzle. The simulations incorporate the main\nphysical processes critical to various aspects of galaxy formation and have a\ndynamic range high enough to identify individual star forming regions. The\nresults indicate that the global Schmidt law is a manifestation of the overall\ndensity distribution of the interstellar medium (ISM). In particular, the\ndensity probability distribution function (PDF) in the simulated disks is\nsimilar to that observed in recent state-of-the-art modeling of the turbulent\nISM and has a well-defined generic shape. The shape of the PDF in a given\nregion of the disk depends on the local average surface density Sigma_g. The\ndependence is such that the fraction of gas mass in the high-density tail of\nthe distribution scales as Sigma_g^{n-1} with n~1.4, which gives rise to the\nSchmidt-like correlation. The high-density tail of the PDF is remarkably\ninsensitive to the inclusion of feedback and details of the cooling and heating\nprocesses. This indicates that the global star formation rate is determined by\nthe supersonic turbulence driven by gravitational instabilities on large\nscales, rather than stellar feedback or thermal instabilities on small scales.",

    "summary": "The present-day significance of Yang's quantized space-time algebra (YST) is\npointed out from the holographic viewpoint. One finds that the D-dimensional\nYST and its modified version (MYST) have the background symmetry SO(D+1,1) and\nSO(D,2), which are well known to underlie the dS/CFT and AdS/CFT\ncorrespondences, respectively. This fact suggests a new possibility of dS/YST\nand AdS/MYST in parallel with dS/CFT and AdS/CFT, respectively. The spatial\ncomponents of quantized space-time and momentum operators of YST have discrete\neigenvalues and their respective minimums, $a$ and 1/R, without contradiction\nto Lorentz-covariance. With respect to MYST, the spatial components of\nspace-time operators and the time component (energy) of momentum operators have\ndiscrete eigenvalues and their respective minimums, $a$ and 1/R, in contrast to\nYST. This discrete structure of YST and MYST, which CFT lacks entirely, may\nprovide a theoretical ground for the unified regularization or cutoff of\nultraviolet and infrared divergences familiar in the UV/IR connection in the\nholographic hypothesis.",

The ground state solution is\nformulated by minimizing the energy functional under a constraint, which is\ndiscretized by the finite element method. The finite element approximation for\n1d, 2d with radial symmetry and 3d with spherical symmetry and cylindrical\nsymmetry are presented in detail and approximate ground state solutions, which\nare used as initial guess in our practical numerical computation of the\nminimization problem, of the GPE in two extreme regimes: very weak interactions\nand strong repulsive interactions are provided. Numerical results in 1d, 2d\nwith radial symmetry and 3d with spherical symmetry and cylindrical symmetry\nfor atoms ranging up to millions in the condensation are reported to\ndemonstrate the novel numerical method. Furthermore, comparisons between the\nground state solutions and their Thomas-Fermi approximations are also reported.\nExtension of the numerical method to compute the excited states of GPE is also\npresented.",

Recently the application of wavelets to the denoising of\nmaps of cosmic microwave background (CMB) fluctuations has been proposed.

In this paper, we give a systematic\ndiscussion of combining these two approaches by the use of the MEM in wavelet\nbases for the denoising and deconvolution of CMB maps and more general images.\nCertain types of wavelet transforms, such as the a trous transform, can be\nviewed as a multi-channel intrinsic correlation function (ICF). We find that\nthe wavelet MEM has lower reconstruction residuals than conventional\npixel-basis MEM in the case when the signal-to-noise ratio is low and the point\nspread function narrow.

We demonstrate that the universe acceleration increase is\ndue to the presence of global rotation effects, although the cosmological\nconstant is still required to explain the SN Ia data.

We are also beyond the model and postulate the existence od additional\nmatter which scales like radiation matter and then analyse how that model fits\nthe SN Ia data.

Contributions to the X-ray emission come from\ndiscrete point sources and extended diffuse emission. The extended emission has\na complex morphology with an extent of 2.4x1.6kpc down to a flux density of\n1.3E-13 erg/s/cm2/arcmin2. The best spectral fit to this emission is obtained\nwith an absorbed, two temperature model giving temperatures for the two gas\ncomponents of 0.28keV and 0.86keV, a total mass content of ~10^7 Msun compared\nwith a galactic mass of several 10^{10} Msun and a total thermal energy content\nof ~2.5E55erg, with an average energy injection rate for the galaxy of a few\n1E41 erg/s. Comparison of the morphology of the diffuse X-ray emission with\nthat of the observed Halpha emission shows similarities in the two emissions.\nAn expanding super-bubble is suggested by the presence of diffuse X-ray\nemission within what appears to be a cavity in the Halpha emission. The\nkinematics of this bubble suggest an expansion velocity of ~220km/s and a mass\ninjection rate of 0.14Msun/yr, but the presence of NGC4449's huge HI halo\n(r~40kpc) may prevent the ejection, into the IGM, of the metal-enriched\nmaterial and energy it contains. The arcsecond-resolution of CHANDRA has\ndetected 24 X-ray point sources down to a completeness level corresponding to a\nflux of ~2E-14 erg/s/cm2, within the optical extent of NGC4449 and analysis of\ntheir spectra has shown them to be from at least 3 different classes of object.\nAs well as the known SNR in this galaxy, it also harbours several X-ray\nbinaries and super-soft sources. The point source X-ray luminosity function,\nfor the higher luminosity sources, has a slope of ~-0.51, comparable to those\nof other starburst galaxies.",

As examples, relativistic Hartree\ntheory is solved for spherical nuclei in a Woods-Saxon basis obtained by\nsolving either the Schr\\\"odinger equation or the Dirac equation (labelled as\nSRHSWS and SRHDWS, respectively and SRHWS for both). In SRHDWS, the negative\nlevels in the Dirac Sea must be properly included. The basis in SRHDWS could be\nsmaller than that in SRHSWS which will simplify the deformed problem. The\nresults from SRHWS are compared in detail with those from solving the spherical\nrelativistic Hartree theory in the harmonic oscillator basis (SRHHO) and those\nin the coordinate space (SRHR). All of these approaches give identical nuclear\nproperties such as total binding energies and root mean square radii for stable\nnuclei. For exotic nuclei, e.g., $^{72}$Ca, SRHWS satisfactorily reproduces the\nneutron density distribution from SRHR, while SRHHO fails. It is shown that the\nWoods-Saxon basis can be extended to more complicated situations for exotic\nnuclei where both deformation and pairing have to be taken into account.",

We use the DeRham-like intersection\ncohomology defined by means of an unfolding. If the action preserves the local\nstructure, then the orbit space X/S1 is again a stratified pseudomanifold of\nlenght 1 and has an unfolding. There is a long exact sequence relating the\nintersection cohomology of X and X/S1 with a third complex $\\mathcal{G}$, the\nGysin Term, whose cohomology depends on basic cohomological data of two\nflavours: global and local.

Also, archival HST data sets (separated by 6.093 years)\nwere used to proper-motion decontaminate the near-infrared sample and extract a\nclean VJHK catalogue. Using the present wide colour baseline, we compared the\ncleaned colour-magnitude diagrams of NGC6528 with those of NGC 6553 and NGC104\nand derived new estimates of reddening and distance, E(B-V)=0.55 and\n(m-M)o=14.44 (7.7 kpc). Moreover, the morphology and location of the cleaned\nred giant branch were used to derive a photometric estimate of the cluster\nmetallicity. The average of 10 metallicity indicators yields a mean value of\n[M/H] ~ 0.0, and [Fe/H] ~-0.20 and +0.08 on the Zinn & West (1984) and Carretta\n& Gratton (1997) revised metallicity scale, respectively. The best isochrone\nfit to the cleaned K,V-K diagram is obtained for a 12.6 Gyr and Z=0.02\nisochrone, i.e. the derived metallicity of NGC6528 turns out to be very close\nto the mean of stars in the Baade's Window. Five AGB variable star candidates,\nwhose membership has to be confirmed spectroscopically, are bolometrically as\nbright as the known long period variable stars in NGC6553.

    "summary": "An analysis of type Ia supernova (SNIa) events in early type galaxies from\nEvans et al (1989) database provides strong evidence that the rate of type Ia\nsupernovae (SNe) in radio-loud galaxies is about 6 times higher than the rate\nmeasured in radio-quiet galaxies, i.e. SNIa-rate$(radio-loud\ngalaxies)=0.47^{+0.23}_{-0.15} h^2_{50}$ SNe per century and per\n10$^{10}$L$^{B}_\\odot$ (SNU) as compared to SNIa-rate$(radio-quiet\ngalaxies)\\lsim 0.080 h^2_{50}$ SNU. The exact value of the enhancement is still\nrather uncertain, but is likely to be in the range $\\sim 4-15$. We discuss the\npossible causes of this result and we conclude that that the enhancement of\nSNIa explosion rate in radio-loud galaxies has the same common origin as their\nbeing strong radio sources, but that there is no causality link between the two\nphenomena. We argue that repeated episodes of interaction and/or mergers of\nearly type galaxies with dwarf companions are responsible for inducing both\nstrong radio activity in $\\sim$14% of early type galaxies, and the $\\sim1$ Gyr\nold stellar population needed to supply an adequate number SNIa progenitors.\nWithin this scenario we predict that the probability of detecting a\ncore-collapse SN event in radio-loud elliptical galaxies amounts to about 4% of\ntheir SNIa events.",

The\nmethod employs a TREESPH code including stellar particles, gas particles,\ncooling and heating of the gas, star formation according to a Jeans criterion,\nand Supernova feedback. A regular spiral disc can be generated as an\nequilibrium situation of two opposing actions. On the one hand cooling and\ndissipation of the gas, on the other hand gas heating by the FUV field of young\nstars and SN mechanical forcing. The disc exhibits small and medium scale\nspiral structure of which the multiplicity increases as a function of radius.\nThe theory of swing amplification can explain, both qualitatively and\nquantitatively, the emerging spiral structure. In addition, swing amplification\npredicts that the existence of a grand design m=2 spiral is only possible if\nthe disc is massive. The simulations show that the galaxy is then unstable to\nbar formation. A general criterion is derived for the transition between bar\nstable and unstable, depending on disc mass contribution and on disc thickness.\nIt seems that bar stability hardly depends on the presence of gas. A detailed\nquantitative analysis is made of the emerging spiral structure and a comparison\nis made with observations. That demonstrates that the structure of the\nnumerical isolated galaxies is not as strong and has a larger multiplicity\ncompared to the structure of some exemplary real galaxies.

Our analysis shows that: a) the southern nucleus is responsible for\nabout 80% of the total infrared luminosity of the system, b) the L-band\nluminosity in the southern nucleus is dominated by the emission from an\nobscured AGN, providing about 40 to 50% of the bolometric flux between 8 and\n1000 microns; c) the northern nucleus does not show evidence for AGN emission\nand appears to be in a post-starburst phase. As for the relative strengths of\nthe AGN and starburst components, we find that, while they are comparable at\nFIR and sub-mm wavelengths, in the radio the Sy2 emission dominates by an order\nof magnitude the starburst.",

    "summary": "The study of Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) is one of the most exciting topics\nthat can be undertaken by long baseline optical interferometry. The magnitudes\nof these objects are at the edge of capabilities of current optical\ninterferometers, limiting the studies to a few dozen, but are well within the\ncapability of coming large aperture interferometers like the VLT\nInterferometer, the Keck Interferometer, the Large Binocular Telescope or\n'OHANA. The milli-arcsecond spatial resolution reached by interferometry probes\nthe very close environment of young stars, down to a tenth of an astronomical\nunit. In this paper, I review the different aspects of star formation that can\nbe tackled by interferometry: circumstellar disks, multiplicity, jets. I\npresent recent observations performed with operational infrared\ninterferometers, IOTA, PTI and ISI, and I show why in the next future one will\nextend these studies with large aperture interferometers.",

We discuss our results in the context of three\ndistinct cluster zones, defined according to different physical processes that\nmay be effective in transforming galaxy morphology in each. By treating\ninfalling galaxies as isolated test particles, we deduce that the most likely\nprocesses responsible for the mild gradient in the morphological mix outside\nthe virial radius are harassment and starvation. Although more data are needed\nto pin down the exact mechanisms, starvation seems more promising in that it\nwould naturally explain the stellar and dynamical homogeneity of cluster E/S0s.\nHowever, we find significant scatter in the local density at any given radius\noutside 0.5 Mpc, and that the same T-Sigma relation holds in subregions of the\ncluster, independent of location. In this hitherto unprobed region, where the\npotential of the cluster is weak, galaxies apparently retain their identities\nas members of infalling sub-groups whose characteristic morphological\nproperties remain intact. Only upon arrival in the central regions is the\nsubstructure erased, as indicated by the tight correlation between cluster\nradius and Sigma.",

The large\nexcitations for small amounts of gas indicate that some regions are either\nsubjected to shocks or must be pressurized within time scales much shorter than\nthe time needed to reach thermal equilibrium. These rapid fluctuations probably\narise from the cascade of macroscopic mechanical energy to small scales through\na turbulent cascade. One consequence of this effect is that changes in gas\ntemperature can arise from near adiabatic compressions and expansions, and this\nmay explain why investigations of 21-cm emission and absorption reveal the\npresence of hydrogen at temperatures well below the expected values derived\nfrom the balance of various known heating and cooling processes.",

    "summary": "Starburst galaxies are generally associated with extended X-ray and radio\nhalos, giving a clear hint of an outflow of gas and relativistic particles from\nthe disk into the halo. The driving agents are, not surprisingly, active star\nforming regions, injecting hot gas and cosmic rays generated by supernova\nremnant and superbubble shock waves. The dynamics of the outflow and the\nthermal evolution of the plasma are strongly coupled, and therefore a\nself-consistent model is necessary for a satisfactory description. Since the\nplasma temperature is between one and a few million Kelvin, the halo is most\nconspicuous in soft X-rays. It will be shown that X-ray data obtained recently\nwith XMM-Newton EPIC pn bear clear spectral signatures that are in strong\ndisagreement with an isothermal halo in collisional ionization equilibrium\n(CIE). Instead a temperature structure in X-ray halos is observed. It will be\ndemonstrated that a galactic wind outflow model in which the non-equilibrium\nionization structure is calculated self-consistently can give a satisfactory\nand physical explanation for the X-ray spectral characteristics, e.g. in case\nof the local starburst galaxy NGC 3079. In particular, high subsolar\nabundances, that have been reported from X-ray observations in some cases, are\nshown to be artefacts of CIE spectral fit models. It is found that spectral\nmodels are strongly constrained by the presence of diagnostic lines such as\nOVII and OVIII as well as Fe-L line complexes. Thus a detailed spectral X-ray\nmodel will help to provide important galactic wind parameters, such as mass\nloss rate and velocity profile, which may also serve as valuable input for\ngalactic outflows in the early universe.",

Here, we begin by expanding on the existing\nanalytic model of the oligarchic growth regime. From this, we derive global\nestimates of the planet formation rate throughout a protoplanetary disk. We\nfind that a relatively high-mass protoplanetary disk ($\\sim$ 10$\\times$\nminimum-mass) is required to produce giant planet core-sized bodies ($\\sim$ 10\nM$_{\\oplus}$) within the lifetime of the nebular gas ($\\la$ 10 million years).\nHowever, an implausibly massive disk is needed to produce even an Earth mass at\nthe orbit of Uranus by 10 Myrs. Subsequent accretion without the dissipational\neffect of gas is even slower and less efficient. In the limit of\nnon-interacting planetesimals, a reasonable-mass disk is unable to produce\nbodies the size of the Solar System's two outer giant planets at their current\nlocations on {\\it any} timescale; if collisional damping of planetesimal random\nvelocities is sufficiently effective, though, it may be possible for a\nUranus/Neptune to form in situ in less than the age of the Solar System. We\nperform numerical simulations of oligarchic growth with gas, and find that\nprotoplanet growth rates agree reasonably well with the analytic model as long\nas protoplanet masses are well below their estimated final masses. However,\naccretion stalls earlier than predicted, so that the largest final protoplanet\nmasses are smaller than those given by the model. Thus the oligarchic growth\nmodel, in the form developed here, appears to provide an upper limit for the\nefficiency of giant planet formation.",

In at least four cases, the PSD shows a \"break,\" a significant\ndeparture from a power law, typically on time scales of order a few days. This\nis similar to the behavior of Galactic X-ray binaries (XRBs), lower mass\ncompact systems with breaks on time scales of seconds. NGC 3783 shows tentative\nevidence for a doubly-broken power law, a feature that until now has only been\nseen in the (much better-defined) PSDs of low-state XRBs. It is also\ninteresting that (when one previously-observed object is added to make a small\nsample of seven), an apparently significant correlation is seen between the\nbreak time scale $T$ and the putative black hole mass $M_{\\rm BH}$, while none\nis seen between break time scale and luminosity. The data are consistent with\nthe linear relation $ T = M_{\\rm BH}/10^{6.5} \\Msun$; extrapolation over 6--7\norders of magnitude is in reasonable agreement with XRBs.

We present results of a detailed\nanalysis of the ASCA data. The spectrum of the source in the 0.5--10 keV band\nis extraordinarily hard and is virtually unobservable below 4 keV because of\nstrong photoabsorption NHL L>4e23 cm^-2. The 4--10 keV emission is dominated by\na Kalpha line of neutral or weakly ionized iron with an equivalent width of\n\\~2.5 keV. There is also an indication for a second line at ~7 keV. Our\nanalysis of archival observations of the IGR J16318-4848 infrared counterpart,\ndiscovered by Foschini et al., shows that the point source is detected at\ndifferent wavelengths in the 1--15 micron range. The available data suggest\nthat IGR J16318-4848 is an X-ray binary system enshrouded by a dense envelope.\nIt is possible that the source is a wind-fed high-mass X-ray binary similar to\nGX 301-2.

Two numerical methods are\nproposed for such discretizations: one is the backward Euler centered finite\ndifference (BEFD), the other one is an explicit time-splitting sine-spectral\n(TSSP) method. Energy diminishing for BEFD and TSSP for linear case, and\nmonotonicity for BEFD for both linear and nonlinear cases are proven.\nComparison between the two methods and existing methods, e.g. Crank-Nicolson\nfinite difference (CNFD) or forward Euler finite difference (FEFD), shows that\nBEFD and TSSP are much better in terms of preserving energy diminishing\nproperty of the normalized gradient flow. Numerical results in 1d, 2d and 3d\nwith magnetic trap confinement potential, as well as a potential of a stirrer\ncorresponding to a far-blue detuned Gaussian laser beam are reported to\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of BEFD and TSSP methods.

Recent numerical simulations indicate that approximately\n30 to 50 percent of the total baryons in the present universe is supposed to\ntake a form of warm/hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) whose X-ray continuum\nemission is very weak. To identify those missing baryons, we consider in detail\nthe detectability of WHIM directly through emission lines of OVII (561, 568,\n574, 665eV) and OVIII (653eV). For this purpose, we create mock spectra of the\nemission lines of WHIM using a light-cone output of the cosmological\nhydrodynamic simulations. Since the predicted fluxes are generally below the\ncurrent detection limit, the unambiguous detection requires a dedicated X-ray\nsatellite mission that we also discuss in detail. We find that our proposed\nmission is sensitive to the WHIM with gas temperature $T=10^{6-7}$K and\noverdensity $\\delta=10-100$ up to a redshift of 0.3 without being significantly\ncontaminated by the cosmic X-ray background and the Galactic emissions.

In that approach the parameter $w$ defined by the equation of\nstate $p=w{\\rho}$ was taken to be fluctuating with mean zero and we compared\nthe theoretical probability distribution function(PDF) for the Hubble parameter\nwith observational data corresponding to a universe with matter and vacuum\nenergy. Eventhough qualitative agreement between the two was obtained, an\nattempt is herein made to introduce a more realistic assumption for the mean of\n$w$ and use it for the calculations. In the present theory the mean values of\nboth $p$ and $w$ are taken to be nonzero. The theoretical and observational\nPDFs are compared for different epochs and values of the Hubble parameter. The\ncorresponding values of the diffusion constant $D$ obtained are approximately\nconstant. We use the scatter in the observed redshift-magnitude data of Type Ia\nsupernova to place limits on the stochastic variation in expansion rate and\nconsequently, on the stochastic variation of the equation of state.",

Each individual\npulse in the temporal profiles is produced by the deceleration of fast moving\nmaterial by a comparatively slower layer within a relativistic wind. The\nspectral evolution of synthetic pulses is first obtained with standard\nequipartition assumptions to estimate the post-shock magnetic field and\nelectron Lorentz factor. We get Ep propto t^-delta with delta=7/2 which is much\nsteeper than the observed slopes delta(obs) <= 1.5. We therefore consider the\npossibility that the equipartition parameters depend on the shock strength and\npost-shock density. We then get a much better agreement with the observations\nand our synthetic pulses satisfy both the hardness-intensity and\nhardness-fluence correlations. We also compute time lags between profiles in\ndifferent energy channels and we find that they decrease with increasing\nhardness. We finally compare our predicted time lag - luminosity relation to\nthe Norris et al. (2000) result obtained from 6 bursts with known redshift.",

P4_1 23) in the entire temperature range. However, the\nfully-ordered model of the crystal structure (no split sites) is marginal at\nroom temperature, and clearly fails at low temperature. A much better\ndescription of the crystal structure below 250K is given in terms of two split\nBa sites, with random occupancies, for two out of three types of cages present\nin the Ba6Ge25 structure. The Ba atoms were found to interact strongly with the\nGe host. The separation of the split Ba sites grows with decreasing\ntemperature, with a sudden increase on cooling through the 200-250K temperature\nrange, accompanied by an expansion of the entire crystal structure. We propose\na simple model for this transition, based on temperature-induced de- trapping\nof Ba from a deep double-well potential. This transition is associated with\nsizeable anomalies in the transport and magnetic properties. The most\nsignificant of these effects, that is, the drop in electrical conductivity on\ncooling, can be easily explained within our model through the enhanced\nstructural disorder, which would affect the relaxation time for all portions of\nthe Fermi surface. We suggest that the other anomalies (increase in the\nabsolute value of the negative Seebeck coefficient, decrease in the magnetic\nsusceptibility) can be explained within the framework of the one-electron semi-\nclassical model, without any need to invoke exotic electron-electron\ninteraction mechanisms.",

    "summary": "The charging of a quantum box, coupled to a lead by tunneling through a\nsingle resonant level, is studied near the degeneracy points of the Coulomb\nblockade. Combining Wilson's numerical renormalization-group method with\nperturbative scaling approaches, the corresponding low-energy Hamiltonian is\nsolved for arbitrary temperatures, gate voltages, tunneling rates, and energies\nof the impurity level. Similar to the case of a weak tunnel barrier, the shape\nof the charge step is governed at low temperatures by the non-Fermi-liquid\nfixed point of the two-channel Kondo effect. However, the associated Kondo\ntemperature TK is strongly modified. Most notably, TK is proportional to the\nwidth of the level if the transmission through the impurity is close to unity\nat the Fermi energy, and is no longer exponentially small in one over the\ntunneling matrix element. Focusing on a particle-hole symmetric level, the\ntwo-channel Kondo effect is found to be robust against the inclusion of an\non-site repulsion on the level. For a large on-site repulsion and a large\nasymmetry in the tunneling rates to box and to the lead, there is a sequence of\nKondo effects: first the local magnetic moment that forms on the level\nundergoes single-channel screening, followed by two-channel overscreening of\nthe charge fluctuations inside the box.",

The main\ningredient of the model is a new extensive empirical stellar spectral library\npresented in Cenarro et al., which is composed of more than 600 stars. Two main\nproducts of interest for stellar population analysis are presented. The first\nis a library of SEDs for SSPs covering a large range of ages, metallicities and\ndifferent IMF types. They are well suited to model galaxy data, since the SSP\nspectra, with flux-calibrated response curves, can be smoothed to match the\nresolution of galaxy data, taking into account the internal velocity dispersion\nof the galaxy, allowing the user to analyze the observed spectrum in its own\nsystem. We also produce integrated absorption line indices for the same SSPs in\nthe form of equivalent widths. We find the following behaviour for the CaII\nfeature in old-aged SSPs: i) the CaII triplet feature does not change much with\ntime for all metallicities for ages larger than ~3 Gyr, ii) this index shows a\nstrong dependence with metallicity for values below [M/H] ~-0.5 and iii) for\nlarger metallicities this feature does not show a significant dependence either\non age or on the metallicity, being more sensitive to changes in the slope of\npower-like IMF shapes. The SSP spectra have been calibrated with measurements\nfor globular clusters. Fitting the models to two early-type galaxies of\ndifferent luminosities, we find that the CaII measurements cannot be fitted\nunless a very dwarf-dominated IMF is imposed, or if the Ca abundance is even\nlower than the Fe abundance.",

Here, this problem is approached from the ground up by\nconsidering theories with multiple interacting massive gravitons. It is\nactually very difficult to construct discrete gravitational dimensions which\nhave a local continuum limit. In fact, any model with only nearest neighbor\ninteractions is doomed. If we could find a non-linear extension for the\nFierz-Pauli Lagrangian for a graviton of mass mg which does not break down\nuntil the scale Lambda_2=(mg Mpl)^(1/2), this could be used to construct a\nlarge class of models whose continuum limit is local in the extra dimension.\nBut this is shown to be impossible: a theory with a single graviton must break\ndown by Lambda_3 = (mg^2 Mpl)^(1/3). Next, we look at how the discretization\nprescribed by the truncation of the KK tower of an honest extra diemsinon\nrasies the scale of strong coupling. It dictates an intricate set of\ninteractions among various fields which conspire to soften the strongest\nscattering amplitudes and allow for a local continuum limit. A number of\ncanditate symmetries associated with locality in the discretized dimension are\nalso discussed.",

It is more efficient than classical LIDAR as the laser is on for 50% of\nthe time, and so can in principle be used during laser guide star adaptive\noptics observations. It also has significant advantages over direct imaging\ntechniques because it does not require a second telescope, is almost\nindependent of the atmospheric conditions, and avoids triangulation problems in\ndetermining the height. In the long term, regular monitoring using this method\nwould allow a valuable database of sodium layer profiles, heights, and return\nflux measurements to be built up which would enable observatory staff\nastronomers to schedule observations optimally. In this paper we describe the\noriginal experiment carried out using the ALFA laser guide star system at Calar\nAlto Observatory in Spain. We validate the method by comparing the LIDAR\nresults with those obtained from simultaneous imaging from an auxiliary\ntelescope. Models are presented of a similar system to be implemented in the\nVery Large Telescope Laser Guide Star Facility, which will enable the initial\nfocus setting for the adaptive optics systems to be determined with an accuracy\nof less than 200 m on a timescale of 1 minute.",

    "summary": "To obtain further insight on possible power law generalizations of Boltzmann\nequilibrium concepts, a stochastic collision model is investigated. We consider\nthe dynamics of a tracer particle of mass $M$, undergoing elastic collisions\nwith ideal gas particles of mass $m$, in the Rayleigh limit $m<<M$. The\nprobability density function (PDF) of the gas particle velocity is\n$f(\\tilde{v}_m)$. Assuming a uniform collision rate and molecular chaos, we\nobtain the equilibrium distribution for the velocity of the tracer particle\n$W_{eq}(V_M)$. Depending on asymptotic properties of $f(\\tilde{v}_m)$ we find\nthat $W_{eq}(V_M)$ is either the Maxwell velocity distribution or a L\\'evy\ndistribution. In particular our results yield a generalized Maxwell\ndistribution based on L\\'evy statistics using two approaches. In the first a\nthermodynamic argument is used, imposing on the dynamics the condition that\nequilibrium properties of the heavy tracer particle be independent of the\ncoupling $\\epsilon=m/M$ to the gas particles, similar to what is found for a\nBrownian particle in a fluid. This approach leads to a generalized temperature\nconcept. In the second approach it is assumed that bath particles velocity PDF\nscales with an energy scale, i.e. the (nearly) ordinary temperature, as found\nin standard statistical mechanics. The two approaches yield different types of\nL\\'evy equilibrium which merge into a unique solution only for the\nMaxwell--Boltzmann case. Thus, relation between thermodynamics and statistical\nmechanics becomes non-trivial for the power law case.

We consider both DE due to a scalar field self--interacting\nthrough Ratra-Peebles or SUGRA potentials, and DE with constant negative\nw=p\\rho >-1. We find that at redshift zero the nonlinear power spectrum of the\ndark matter, and the mass function of halos, practically do not depend on DE\nstate equation and are almost indistinguishable from predictions of the LCDM\nmodel. This is consistent with the nonlinear analysis presented in the\naccompanying paper. It is also a welcome feature because LCDM models fit a\nlarge variety of data. On the other hand, at high redshifts DE models show\nsubstantial differences from LCDM and substantial differences among themselves.\nHalo profiles differ even at z=0. DE halos are denser than LCDM in their\ncentral parts because the DE halos collapse earlier. Nevertheless, differences\nbetween the models are not so large. For example, the density at 10 kpc of a DE\n\\~10^{13}Msun halo deviates from LCDM by not more than 50%. This, however,\nmeans that DE is not a way to ease the problem with cuspy dark matter profiles.\nAddressing another cosmological problem - abundance of subhalos -- we find that\nthe number of satellites of halos in various DE models does not change relative\nto the LCDM, when normalized to the same circular velocity of the parent halo.\nTo summarize, the best way to find which DE model fits the observed Universe is\nto look for evolution of halo properties. For example, the abundance of galaxy\ngroups with mass larger than 10^{13}\\Msun at z> 2 can be used to discriminate\nbetween the models, and, thus, to constrain the nature of DE.",

We\nfind that the disruption of satellite galaxies in orbits roughly coplanar with\nthe disk leads naturally to the formation of ring-like stellar structures\nsimilar to that recently discovered in the outer disk of the Milky Way. Two\ninterpretations appear plausible in this context. One is that the ring is a\ntransitory, localized radial density enhancement reflecting the apocenter of\nparticles stripped from a satellite during a recent pericentric passage (a\n``tidal arc'' reminiscent of the tidal arms seen in disk galaxy mergers). In\nthe second scenario, the ring is analogous to the ``shells'' found around some\nelliptical galaxies, and would result from a minor merger that took place\nseveral Gyr ago. The two interpretations differ in several ways. Tidal arcs are\nexpected to span a limited longitude range; may carry a substantial fraction of\nthe original mass of the satellite; should exhibit a significant velocity\ngradient with Galactic longitude; and are in all likelihood asymmetric above\nand below the plane of the disk. Shells, on the other hand, may comprise at\nmost a small fraction of the original mass of the satellite and, due to their\nmore relaxed state, ought to be symmetric above and below the plane, with no\ndiscernible velocity gradients across the structure. If confirmed as a tidal\nfeature, the ring discovered by SDSS in the outer Galactic disk would\nstrengthen the view--supported by numerical simulations--that minor mergers\nhave played a significant role building up not only the stellar halo, but also\nthe disk components of the Galaxy.",

The multifractal (MF)\nfunction f(alpha, c) of the harmonic measure near any CI fractal boundary, is\ngiven as a function of the central charge c of the associated CFT. The\nHausdorff dimensions D_{H} of a non-simple scaling curve or cluster hull, and\nD_{EP} of its external perimeter or frontier, are shown to obey the duality\nequation (D_{H}-1)(D_{EP}-1)=1/4, valid for any c. The universal mixed MF\nspectrum f(alpha,lambda;c) describing the local spiralling rate lambda and\nsingularity exponent alpha of the potential near any CI scaling curve is given.\nThe duality between simple and non-simple random paths is established via a\nsymmetry of the KPZ quantum gravity map. An extended dual KPZ relation is\nintroduced for the SLE_{kappa}, which commutes with the kappa to\nkappa'=16/kappa duality. This gives the SLE exponents from simple QG rules,\nestablished from the general structure of correlation functions of arbitrary\ninteracting random sets on a random lattice.",

Our\nfundamental assumption is that the angular momenta of binary star systems is\ndirectly related to the net angular momentum induced by turbulence in parent\nmolecular cloud cores. The primary results of this model are as follows. (i) A\nquantitative prediction of the initial width of the binary period distribution\n($\\sigma_{\\log {P}_d} = 1.6 - 2.1$ for a star formation efficiency in the range\n$\\epsilon_* = 0.1 - 0.9$). (ii) A robust, negative anticorrelation of binary\nperiod and mass ratio. (iii) A robust, positive correlation of binary period\nand eccentricity. (iv) A robust prediction that the binary separation of\nlow-mass systems should be more closely separated than those of solar-mass or\nlarger. These predictions are in good agreement with observations of PMS binary\nsystems with periods $P > 10^3$ d, which account for the majority of all\nbinaries.\n  We conclude with a brief discussion of the implications of our results for\nobservational and theoretical studies of multiple star formation.",

Background material, on the\ndependence of region or system sizes on both the resources required to study\nthe regions or systems and the indirectness of the reality status of the\nsystems, suggests that one associate to each amount, r, of resources a domain,\nD_{r}, a theory, T_{r}, and a language, L_{r}. D_{r} is limited in that all\nstatements in D_{r} require at most r resources to verify or refute. T_{r} is\nlimited in that any theorem of T_{r} must be provable using at most r\nresources. Also any theorem of T_{r} must be true in D_{r}. L_{r} is limited in\nthat all expressions in L_{r} require at most r resources to create, display,\nand maintain. A partial ordering of the resources is used to describe minimal\nuse of resources, a partial ordering of the T_{r}, and motion of an observer\nusing resources to acquire knowledge. Reflection principles are used to push\nthe effect of Godel's incompleteness theorem on consistency up in the partial\nordering.

This phenomenon is rare in QSOs which are\nnot radio loud, and this is the first time it has been observed at $z>4$.

We\npresent an analysis of HST STIS echelle and FUSE UV spectroscopy of RX\nJ1230.8+0115 in which we detect five Lyman-alpha absorbers at Virgo distances.\nOne of these absorbers is a blend of two strong metal line absorbers coincident\nin velocity with the highest neutral hydrogen column density absorber in the 3C\n273 sightline ~350 h_70 kpc away. The consistency of the metal line column\ndensity ratios in the RX J1230.8+0115 sightline allows us to determine the\nionization mechanism (photoionization) for these absorbers. While the low\nsignal-to-noise ratio of the FUSE spectrum limits our ability to model the\nneutral hydrogen column density of these absorbers, we are able to constrain\nthem to be in the range 10^{16-17} cm^-2. The properties of these absorbers are\nsimilar to those of the 3C 273 absorber studied by Tripp et al. However, the\ninferred line-of-sight size for the 3C 273 absorber is only 70 pc, much smaller\nthan those inferred in RX J1230.8+0115, which are 10-30 h_70 kpc.

    "summary": "We discuss the process of adiabatic growth of central black holes in the\npresence of a stationary, pre-existing distribution of collisionless stars.\nWithin the limitations of the assumptions, the resulting models make robust\nphysical predictions for the presence of a central cusp in the stellar and dark\nmatter density, a Keplerian rise in the velocity dispersion, and a significant\ntangential polarization of the velocity tensor. New generations of numerical\nmodels have confirmed and extended previous results, permit the study of\naxisymmetric and triaxial systems, and promise new insight into the dynamics of\nthe central regions of galaxies. These studies enable detailed comparisons with\nobservations, further our understanding on the fueling processes for AGNs and\nquiescent black holes, and help elucidate the secular evolution of the inner\nregions and spheroids of galaxies.",

Various properties computed\nfrom the simulation including the density profile, granular temperature and\ncirculation pattern are in good qualitative agreement with the experiments. We\nthen studied the effect of varying the mass ratio and the size ratio\nindependently while holding the other parameters constant. The mass and size\nratio are shown to affect the distribution of the energy. The changes in the\nenergy distributions affect the packing fraction and temperature of each\ncomponent. The temperature of the heavier component has a non-linear dependence\non the mass of the lighter component, while the temperature of the lighter\ncomponent is approximately proportional to its mass. The temperature of both\ncomponents is inversely dependent on the size of the smaller component.",

    "summary": "Galaxy cluster mass distributions offer an important test of the cold dark\nmatter picture of structure formation, and may even contain clues about the\nnature of dark matter. X-ray imaging spectroscopy of relaxed systems can map\ncluster dark matter distributions, but are usually complicated by the presence\nof central cool components in the intracluster medium. Here we describe a\nstatistically correct approach to distinguishing amongst simple alternative\nmodels of the cool component, and apply it to one cluster. We also present mass\nprofiles and central density slopes for five clusters derived from Chandra\ndata, and illustrate how assumptions about the cool component affect the\nresulting mass profiles. For four of these objects, we find that the central\ndensity profile (r < 200 h_50^-1 kpc) rho(r) = r^a with -2 < a < -1, for either\nof two models of the central cool component. These results are consistent with\nstandard CDM predictions.",

On large scales\n(r> 40kpc), the X-ray surface brightness is symmetric and slightly elliptical.\nThe cluster has a cool dense core; the radial temperature gradient varies with\nposition angle. The radial metallicity profile shows a pronounced central drop\nand an off-center peak. Similarly to many clusters with dense cores, 2A\n0335+096 hosts a cold front at r\\approx 40kpc south of the center. The gas\npressure across the front is discontinuous by a factor A_P=1.6\\pm 0.3,\nindicating that the cool core is moving with respect to the ambient gas with a\nMach number M\\approx 0.75\\pm 0.2. The central dense region inside the cold\nfront shows an unusual X-ray morphology, which consists of a number of X-ray\nblobs and/or filaments on scales \\gtrsim 3kpc, along with two prominent X-ray\ncavities. The X-ray blobs are not correlated with either the optical line\nemission (H\\alpha+[NII]), member galaxies or radio emission. Deprojected\ntemperature of the dense blobs is consistent with that of the less dense\nambient gas, so these gas phases do not appear to be in thermal pressure\nequilibrium. An interesting possibility is a significant, unseen non-thermal\npressure component in the inter-blob gas, possibly arising from the activity of\nthe central AGN. We discuss two models for the origin of the gas blobs --\nhydrodynamic instabilities caused by the observed motion of the gas core, or\n``bubbling'' of the core caused by multiple outbursts of the central AGN.",
