To derive contraction\nages, we use four different pre-main sequence models, with an empirically\ncalibrated color-temperature relation to match the Pleiades cluster sequence.\n  Results: When using exclusively the V vs. V-I color-magnitude diagram and\nempirically calibrated isochrones, there is consistency between nuclear and\ncontraction ages for the studied clusters. Although the contraction ages seem\nsystematically underestimated, in none of cases they deviate by more than one\nstandard deviation from the nuclear ages.",

Initially it was expected that\nobservable macroscopic effects caused by microscopic violations of Lorentz\ninvariance would necessarily be suppressed by at least one power of the small\nratio between the Planck length and macroscopic lengths. Here we discuss the\nimplications of the fact that this expectation is in contradiction with\nstandard properties of radiative corrections in quantum field theories. In\nnormal field theories, radiative corrections in the presence of microscopic\nLorentz violation give macroscopic Lorentz violation that is suppressed only by\nthe size of Standard Model couplings, in clear conflict with observation. In\ngeneral, this conclusion can only be avoided by extreme fine tuning of the\nparameters of the theory.",

The eclipse profiles are analyzed with a\nparameter-fitting model that assumes four sources of luminosity: a white dwarf\nprimary star, a main-sequence secondary star, a flared accretion disk with a\nrim, and a bright spot at the intersection of the mass-transfer stream and the\ndisk periphery. A matrix of model solutions are computed, covering an extensive\nrange of plausible parameter values. The solution matrix is then explored to\ndetermine the optimum values for the fitting parameters and their associated\nerrors. For models that treat the accretion disk as a flat structure without a\nrim, optimum fits require that the disk have a flat temperature profile.\nAlthough models with a truncated inner disk (R_in >> R_wd) result in a steeper\ntemperature profile, steady-state models with a temperature profile\ncharacterized by T(r) \\propto r^{-3/4} are found only for models with a\nsignificant disk rim.

The\nmechanisms for magnetic energy storage are crucial in understanding how a field\nmay possess enough free energy to overcome the Aly limit and open up.\nPreviously, we have pointed out that the accumulation of magnetic helicity in\nthe corona plays a significant role in storing magnetic energy. In this paper,\nwe investigate another hydromagnetic consequence of magnetic-helicity\naccumulation. We propose a conjecture that there is an upper bound on the total\nmagnetic helicity that a force-free field can contain. This is directly related\nto the hydromagnetic property that force-free fields in unbounded space have to\nbe self-confining. Although a mathematical proof of this conjecture for any\nfield configuration is formidable, its plausibility can be demonstrated with\nthe properties of several families of power-law, axisymmetric force-free\nfields. We put forth mathematical evidence, as well as numerical, indicating\nthat an upper bound on the magnetic helicity may exist for such fields. Thus,\nthe accumulation of magnetic helicity in excess of this upper bound would\ninitiate a non-equilibrium situation, resulting in a CME expulsion as a natural\nproduct of coronal evolution.",

In this paper, we extend this \"double spinor\" formalism to\nthe case of the supermembrane in 11 dimensions at the classical level. The\nbasic scheme works in parallel with the string case and we are able to\nconstruct the closed algebra of first class constraints which governs the\nentire dynamics of the system.

The\ndependencies of the amplitude of the quantum oscillations on amplitude of\ninducing ac current are measured at different temperatures below\nsuperconducting transition Tc on aluminum asymmetric loops and systems of the\nloops connected in series. The measured values of the maximum amplitude of the\nquantum oscillations, the amplitude of the ac current inducing this maximum dc\nvoltage and the critical amplitude of the ac current decrease with temperature\nincrease to Tc. The extrapolation of these measured dependencies to the region\nnear superconducting transition allows to make a calibration of asymmetric\nsuperconducting loops as quantum detector of noise. The calibration restores an\namplitude profile of the noise pulses from a measured temperature dependence of\nan amplitude of the quantum oscillations induced by this noise. It is found\nthat rectification efficiency, determined as relation of the maximum amplitude\nof the quantum oscillations to the ac current amplitude inducing it, decreases\nnear superconducting transition Tc. High efficiency of rectification observed\nbelow Tc is consequence of irreversibility of the current-voltage curves.\nIncrease of the rectification efficiency is achieved in multiple series\nconnected loop structures.",

Taylor has remarked that U(1), being a\nmultiply-connected group, in general, should have different coupling strengths\nfor singlets and doublets. But in the development of the standard model, even\nfor U(1), the coupling strength has been taken to be the same for all the\nmultiplets without a priori justification. Wilczek has pointed out that the\nassignment of hypercharge values to left- and right-handed leptons and quarks\nis very peculiar. However, no solution has been provided. Ellis has also\nreservations for the rather bizarre set up of group representations and\nhypercharges. It has also been noticed that, in addition to the above weak\npoints of the model, the generator of the group U(1) is changed at different\nstages during a single analysis. In this paper, a new basis is provided that\navoids these peculiar and odd concepts and hypercharge assignments, and a\nsatisfactory solution is given for the first time. This is done by generalising\nthe expression for the transformation law for 4-vector potential in\nelectromagnetism. It gives exactly the same results as obtained in the standard\nmodel for electroweak interactions.",

Fossil cavities are ellipsoidal or cylindrical shells\nof swept-up of ambient (molecular cloud) material moving at low velocities. The\ncavities form when the momentum in a YSO jet or wide angle outflow decays in\ntime allowing the bowshock or swept-up shell to decelerate to velocities near\nthe turbulent speed in the cloud. It has been suggested in previous studies\nthat cavities provide efficient coupling between the jets/outflows and the\ncloud and, as such, are the agents by which cloud turbulence is can be\nre-energized. In this paper we carry forward a series of numerical simulations\nof jets and outflows whose momentum flux decrease in time. We compare\nsimulations with decaying momentum fluxes to those with constant flux. We show\nthat decaying flux models exhibit deceleration of the outflow head and\nbackfilling via expansion off of the cavity walls. They also have lower density\ncontrast, are longer lived and wider than their continuously driven\ncounterparts. The simulations recover the basic properties of observed fossil\ncavities. In addition, we provide synthetic observations in terms of P-V\ndiagrams which demonstrate that fossil cavities form both jets and wide angle\noutflows are characterized by linear \"Hubble-law\" expansions patterns\nsuperimposed on \"spur\" patterns indicative of the head of a bow shock.",

One\nof the fundamental problems in large scale mining of spectra is to design\nappropriate metrics and algorithms to avoid all-pair-wise comparisons of\nspectra. In this paper, we present a general framework based on vector spaces\nto avoid pair-wise comparisons. We first robustly embed spectra in a high\ndimensional space in a novel fashion and then apply fast approximate near\nneighbor algorithms for tasks such as constructing filters for database search,\nindexing and similarity searching. We formally prove that our embedding has low\ndistortion compared to the cosine similarity, and, along with locality\nsensitive hashing (LSH), we design filters for database search that can filter\nout more than 989% of peptides (118 times less) while missing at most 0.29% of\nthe correct sequences. We then show how our framework can be used in similarity\nsearching, which can then be used to detect tight clusters or replicates. On an\naverage, for a cluster size of 16 spectra, LSH only misses 1 spectrum and\nadmits only 1 false spectrum. In addition, our framework in conjunction with\ndimension reduction techniques allow us to visualize large datasets in 2D\nspace. Our framework also has the potential to embed and compare datasets with\npost translation modifications (PTM).",

However, their analysis of the problem,\nbased on more appropriate low-frequency metallic boundary conditions, uses an\nincorrect form of boundary conditions for TE modes. We repeat their analysis,\nusing the correct boundary conditions. Our computations confirm their most\nimportant result: contrary to the result of the dielectric model, the thermal\nTE mode correction leads to an increase in the TE mode force of attraction\nbetween the plates.

As\nseveral pharmaceutical companies are starting large phase III trials for R5 and\nX4 drugs, models are needed to predict the co-evolutionary and competitive\ndynamics of virus strains. We present a model of HIV early infection which\ndescribes the dynamics of R5 quasispecies and a model of HIV late infection\nwhich describes the R5 to X4 switch. We report the following findings: after\nsuperinfection or coinfection, quasispecies dynamics has time scales of several\nmonths and becomes even slower at low number of CD4+ T cells. The curve of CD4+\nT cells decreases, during AIDS late stage, and can be described taking into\naccount the X4 related Tumor Necrosis Factor dynamics. Phylogenetic inference\nof chemokine receptors suggests that viral mutational pathway may generate R5\nvariants able to interact with chemokine receptors different from CXCR4.

In\nparticular, the subhypergroups and automorphisms are classified, and we show\nthat each quotient by a subhypergroup carries a hypergroup structure of the\nsame type.\n  The algebraic properties are partially related to properties of random walks\non matrix Bessel hypergroups. In particular, known properties of Wishart\ndistributions, which form Gaussian convolution semigroups on these hypergroups,\nare put into a new light. Moreover, limit theorems for random walks on these\nhypergroups are presented.

Two ways of combining learning and genetic\nsearch are explored: one exploits the Baldwin effect, while the other uses a\nLamarckian strategy. Our experiments show that using a Lamarckian op- erator\nmakes the algorithm find networks with a low error rate, and the smallest size,\nwhile using the Bald- win effect obtains MLPs with the smallest error rate, and\na larger size, taking longer to reach a solution.

The hardness of the gamma-ray spectrum and the\nconditions in those molecular clouds indicate that the cosmic rays giving rise\nto the gamma-rays are likely to be protons and nuclei rather than electrons.\nThe energy associated with the cosmic rays could have come from a single\nsupernova explosion around 10,000 years ago.",

Little is known about whether the same principles of local\nattachment and global properties apply to societies as well. Empirical evidence\nfrom six ethnographic case studies shows that complex social networks have\nsignificantly lower scaling exponents gamma ~ 1 than have been assumed in the\npast. Apparently humans do not only look for the most prominent players to play\nwith. Moreover cooperation in humans is characterized through reciprocity, the\ntendency to give to those from whom one has received in the past. Both\nvariables -- reciprocity and the scaling exponent -- are negatively correlated\n($r=-0.767, sig=0.075$). If we include this effect in simulations of growing\nnetworks, degree distributions emerge that are much closer to those empirically\nobserved. While the proportion of nodes with small degrees decreases\ndrastically as we introduce reciprocity, the scaling exponent is more robust\nand changes only when a relatively large proportion of attachment decisions\nfollow this rule. If social networks are less scale free than previously\nassumed this has far reaching implications for policy makers, public health\nprograms and marketing alike.",

    "summary": "The surrogate data method is widely applied as a data dependent technique to\ntest observed time series against a barrage of hypotheses. However, often the\nhypotheses one is able to address are not those of greatest interest,\nparticularly for system known to be nonlinear. In the review we focus on\ntechniques which overcome this shortcoming. We summarize a number of recently\ndeveloped surrogate data methods. While our review of surrogate methods is not\nexhaustive, we do focus on methods which may be applied to experimental, and\npotentially nonlinear, data. In each case, the hypothesis being tested is one\nof the interests to the experimental scientist.",

A pivot is a fixed\nsubset of valuations which are considered to be the important ones in the\nabsolute sense. We worked with a general notion of valuation that covers e.g.\nthe classical valuations as well as certain kinds of many-valued valuations. In\nthe many-valued cases, pivotal consequence relations are paraconsistant (in\naddition to be plausible), i.e. they are capable of drawing reasonable\nconclusions which contain contradictions. We will provide in our general\nframework syntactic characterizations of several families of pivotal relations.\nIn addition, we will provide, again in our general framework, characterizations\nof several families of pivotal discriminative consequence relations. The latter\nare defined exactly as the plain version, but contradictory conclusions are\nrejected. We will also answer negatively a representation problem that was left\nopen by Makinson. Finally, we will put in evidence a connexion with X-logics\nfrom Forget, Risch, and Siegel.

We study the ability of such surveys to\nconstrain neutrino masses and the equation of state parameter of the dark\nenergy, focussing on how tomographic information can improve the sensitivity to\nthese parameters. We also provide a detailed discussion of systematic effects\npertinent to weak lensing surveys, and the possible degradation of sensitivity\nto cosmological parameters due to these effects. For future probes such as the\nLarge Synoptic Survey Telescope survey, we find that, when combined with cosmic\nmicrowave background data from the Planck satellite, a sensitivity to neutrino\nmasses of sigma(sum m_nu) < 0.05 eV can be reached. This results is robust\nagainst variations in the running of the scalar spectral index, the\ntime-dependence of dark energy equation of state, and/or the number of\nrelativistic degrees of freedom.",

    "summary": "Star formation generally proceeds inside-out, with overdense regions inside\nprotostellar cores collapsing rapidly and progressively less dense regions\nfollowing later. Consequently, a small protostar will form early in the\nevolution of a core, and collapsing material will fall to the protostellar\nsurface and radiate away its gravitational potential energy. The resulting\naccretion luminosity will heat the core and may substantially affect the\nprocess of fragmentation. This is of particular interest for massive cores\nthat, at their initial temperatures, have masses much greater than a thermal\nJeans mass and thus might be expected to fragment into many stars during\ncollapse. Here I show that accretion luminosity can heat the inner parts of a\ncore to >100 K very early in the star formation process, and that this in turn\nstrongly suppresses fragmentation. This has implications for a number of\noutstanding problems in star formation, including the mechanism of massive star\nformation, the origin of the stellar initial mass function and its relationship\nto the core mass function, the demographics of massive binaries, and the\nequation of state in star-forming gas.",

The\ncorrelations between log Lx and mass found for PMS stars on convective tracks\nin these clusters are consistent with the relationships found for the ONC,\nindicating little change in the median values of either log Lx or log Lx/Lbol\nduring the first ~3-5 Myr of evolution down convective tracks. The fraction of\nstars with extreme values of Lx, more than 10 times higher than the average for\na given Lbol or with log Lx/Lbol greater than the canonical saturation value of\n-2.9, is however larger by a factor of two in the younger ONC when compared\nwith the Orion FF and NGC 2264.\n  PMS stars in NGC 2264 on radiative tracks have Lx/Lbol values that are\nsystematically lower by a factor of ~10 times than those found for stars of\nsimilar mass on convective tracks. The dramatic decrease in flux from\nconvective to radiative phases of PMS evolution is likely related to major\nstructural changes which influence the efficiency of magnetic field generation\nand thus the level of magnetic activity.\n  As in the ONC, we find that stars with measured periods have, on average,\nhigher X-ray luminosities. However, there is a wide range in Lx and Lx/Lbol for\nboth periodic and non-periodic stars of similar mass. Among stars with measured\nperiods, the level of X-ray emission does not correlate with the rotation rate.\n  For this data set, we find no statistically significant correlation between\nX-ray flux and (a) the presence or absence of circumstellar accretion disks, or\n(b) disk accretion rates as assessed from ultraviolet excesses.",

The model describes two Kondo\nsublattices with an intrasite Kondo interaction strength $J_{K}$ and an\ninterlattice quantum Ising interaction in the presence of a transverse field\n$\\Gamma$. The interlattice coupling is a random Gaussian distributed variable\n(with average $-2J_0/N$ and variance $32 J^{2}/N$) while the $\\Gamma$ field is\nintroduced as a quantum mechanism to produce spin flipping. The path integral\nformalism is used to study this fermionic problem where the spin operators are\nrepresented by bilinear combinations of Grassmann fields. The disorder is\ntreated within the framework of the replica trick. The free energy and the\norder parameters of the problem are obtained by using the static ansatz and by\nchoosing both $J_0/J$ and $\\Gamma/J \\approx (J_k/J)^2$ to allow, as previously,\na better comparison with the experimental findings.\n  The results indicate the presence of a SG solution at low $J_K/J$ and for\ntemperature $T<T_{f}$ ($T_{f}$ is the freezing temperature). When $J_K/J$ is\nincreased, a mixed phase AF+SG appears, then an AF solution and finally a Kondo\nstate is obtained for high values of $J_{K}/J$. Moreover, the behaviors of the\nfreezing and Neel temperatures are also affected by the relationship between\n$J_{K}$ and the transverse field $\\Gamma$. The first one presents a slight\ndecrease while the second one decreases towards a Quantum Critical Point (QCP).\nThe obtained phase diagram has the same sequence as the experimental one for\n$Ce_{2}Au_{1-x}Co_{x}Si_{3}$, if $J_{K}$ is assumed to increase with $x$, and\nin addition, it also shows a qualitative agreement concerning the behavior of\nthe freezing and the Neel temperatures.",

With increasing energy, the\nantibonding-band scattering rate becomes higher than the bonding one. The\nobservations imply the character of the scatterers dominant at low energies.",

    "summary": "We studied the radio source associated with the ultraluminous X-ray source in\nNGC 5408 (L_X ~ 10^{40} erg/s). The radio spectrum is steep (index ~ -1),\nconsistent with optically-thin synchrotron emission, not with flat-spectrum\ncore emission. Its flux density (~ 0.28 mJy at 4.8 GHz, at a distance of 4.8\nMpc) was the same in the March 2000 and December 2004 observations, suggesting\nsteady emission rather than a transient outburst. However, it is orders of\nmagnitude higher than expected from steady jets in stellar-mass microquasar.\nBased on its radio flux and spectral index, we suggest that the radio source is\neither an unusually bright supernova remnant, or, more likely, a radio lobe\npowered by a jet from the black hole. Moreover, there is speculative evidence\nthat the source is marginally resolved with a radius ~ 30 pc. A faint HII\nregion of similar size appears to coincide with the radio and X-ray sources,\nbut its ionization mechanism remains unclear. Using a self-similar solution for\nthe expansion of a jet-powered electron-positron plasma bubble, in the\nminimum-energy approximation, we show that the observed flux and (speculative)\nsize are consistent with an average jet power ~ 7 x 10^{38} erg/s ~ 0.1 L_X ~\n0.1 L_{Edd}, an age ~ 10^5 yr, a current velocity of expansion ~ 80 km/s. We\nbriefly discuss the importance of this source as a key to understand the\nbalance between luminosity and jet power in accreting black holes.",

Its behavior, instead, is more typical of highly massive stars\nwhich experience the short-lived luminous blue variable (LBV) phase toward the\nend of their lives. The star, in fact, most resembles the LBV S Doradus in\noutburst. The precursor of SN 2002kg is the irregular, bright blue variable\nstar 37 (V37), catalogued by Tammann & Sandage in 1968. Using high-quality\nground-based, multi-band images we can constrain the initial mass of V37 to be\nM_ini >~ 40 M_sun. We find that, although the spectra indicate a nitrogen\nenhancement, possibly revealing the products of CNO processing by V37 in the\nejecta, the star lacks a substantial LBV nebula. The outburst from SN\n2002kg/V37 is not nearly as energetic as the giant eruptions of the eta\nCarinae-like variables, such as SN 1954J/V12, also in NGC 2403.

We further compare these values to a control sample of 67 mostly\nisolated, non-interacting E/S0 galaxies. The paired E/S0 galaxies occupy a more\nscattered loci in CAS space than non-interacting E/S0's, and the structural\neffects of interactions on E/S0's are minor, in contrast to disk galaxies\ninvolved in interactions. This suggests that observational methods for\nrecognizing interactions at high z, such the CAS methodology, would hardly\ndetect E/S0's involved in interactions (related to early phases of the so\ncalled `dry-mergers'). We however find statistical differences in A when\ncomparing isolated and interacting E/S0s.

    "summary": "Theories that spontaneously break Lorentz invariance also violate\ndiffeomorphism symmetries, implying the existence of extra degrees of freedom\nand modifications of gravity. In the minimal model (``ghost condensation'')\nwith only a single extra degree of freedom at low energies, the scale of\nLorentz violation cannot be larger than about M ~ 100GeV due to an infrared\ninstability in the gravity sector. We show that Lorentz symmetry can be broken\nat much higher scales in a non-minimal theory with additional degrees of\nfreedom, in particular if Lorentz symmetry is broken by the vacuum expectation\nvalue of a vector field. This theory can be constructed by gauging ghost\ncondensation, giving a systematic effective field theory description that\nallows us to estimate the size of all physical effects. We show that nonlinear\neffects become important for gravitational fields with strength \\sqrt{\\Phi} >\ng, where g is the gauge coupling, and we argue that the nonlinear dynamics is\nfree from singularities. We then analyze the phenomenology of the model,\nincluding nonlinear dynamics and velocity-dependent effects. The strongest\nbounds on the gravitational sector come from either black hole accretion or\ndirection-dependent gravitational forces, and imply that the scale of\nspontaneous Lorentz breaking is M < Min(10^{12}GeV, g^2 10^{15}GeV). If the\nLorentz breaking sector couples directly to matter, there is a spin-dependent\ninverse-square law force, which has a different angular dependence from the\nforce mediated by the ghost condensate, providing a distinctive signature for\nthis class of models.",

Here we advance a novel third\nhypothesis: some spectral differences are due to small line-of-sight\ndifferences through quasar disk wind outflows. In particular, we propose that\nvariable spectral differences seen only in component A of the widest separation\nlens SDSSJ1004+4112 are due to differential absorption along the sightlines.\nThe absorber properties required by this hypothesis are akin to known broad\nabsorption line (BAL) outflows but must have a broader, smoother velocity\nprofile. We interpret the observed CIV emission line variability as further\nevidence for spatial fine structure transverse to the line of sight. Since\noutflows are likely to be rotating, such absorber fine structure can\nconsistently explain some of the UV and X-ray variability seen in AGN. The\nimplications are many: (1) Spectroscopic differences in other lensed objects\nmay be due to this ``lens-aided multi-angle spectroscopy'' (LAMAS). (2)\nOutflows have fine structure on size scales of arcsec as seen from the nucleus.\n(3) Assuming either broad absorption line region sizes proposed in recent wind\nmodels, or typically assumed continuum emission region sizes, LAMAS and/or\nvariability provide broadly consistent absorber sizescale estimates of about\n10^15cm.

Depending on the rotation rate,\nthe mean-field dynamo can lead to the formation of three different types of\npulsars. If the initial period of the protoneutron star is short, then the\ngenerated large-scale field is very strong ($> 3 \\times 10^{13}$G) and exceeds\nthe small-scale field at the neutron star surface. If rotation is moderate,\nthen the pulsars are formed with more or less standard dipole fields ($< 3\n\\times 10^{13}$G) but with surface small-scale magnetic fields stronger than\nthe dipole field. If rotation is very slow, then the mean-field dynamo does not\noperate, and the neutron star has no global field.

    "summary": "In this paper we present a general formulation for electronic transport that\ncombines strong correlation effects with broadening and quantum coherence, and\nillustrate it with a simple example (\"spin blockade\") that clearly demonstrates\nall three effects. The standard master equation method for Coulomb blockade\ncaptures the first effect, while a number of different approaches such as the\nnon-equilibrium Green function (NEGF) method are available for handling the\nlast two. But there is a need for a method that captures all three and in this\npaper we propose an approach that appears to fulfill this need. The equations\nlook similar to the NEGF formalism but one basic distinction is that all\nquantities (like the Hamiltonian) appearing in our formalism are defined in\nFock space and as such are matrices of dimension (2^N by 2^N), N being the\nnumber of basis functions describing the one-electron Hilbert space. Similar\nquantities appearing in the NEGF formalism are of dimension (N by N). Other\nimportant differences arise from the fact that in Fock space there is no need\nto include the exclusion principle explicitly and that elastic processes in\none-electron space look like inelastic processes in Fock space. A simple\nnumerical example is presented to show that our approach includes strong\nelectron-electron interaction, broadening due to coupling to contacts and\nquantum coherence effects due to spin polarization in directions other than the\nz-direction. The basic equations for this \"Fock space Green's function\" (FSGF)\nare quite general and should be applicable to more interesting and exotic\ntransport problems involving the entanglement of many-electron states. How\neffective it will be remains to be assessed for different problems, but our\npreliminary results for the Kondo peak look encouraging.",

The threshold value of d at which this\ntransition occurs decreases with P (e.g., 1.6 nm at P ~ -0.05 GPa; 0.5 nm at P\n\\~ 0.1 GPa), until, at high P, no capillary evaporation occurs.

When water is confined by hydrophilic (hydroxylated silica) plates,\nit remains in the liquid phase at all P and d studied. Interestingly, we\nobserve, for this case, that even at the P at which bulk water cavitates, the\nconfined water remains in the liquid state. We also study systematically the\nstate of hydration at different P for both kinds of plates. For the range of\nconditions studied here, we find that in the presence of hydrophobic plates the\neffect of P is to enhance water structure and to push water molecules toward\nthe plates.

Our model may be applicable to the\ncuprate superconductors, where a random electrostatic potential exists in the\nCuO2 planes as a result of the presence of charged dopants. We argue that the\npresence of a random potential can affect the unidirectionality of the CDW\norder, characterized by an Ising order parameter. Coupling to a unidirectional\nCDW, the random potential can lead to the formation of domains with 90 degree\nrelative orientation, thus tending to restore the rotational symmetry of the\nunderlying lattice. We find that the correlation length of the Ising order can\nbe significantly larger than the CDW correlation length. For a checkerboard CDW\non the other hand, disorder generates spatial anisotropies on short length\nscales and thus some degree of unidirectionality. We quantify these disorder\neffects and suggest new techniques for analyzing the local density of states\n(LDOS) data measured in scanning tunneling microscopy experiments.",

We analysis the minimal access\nstructure, $d_{min}$ and $d_{cheat}$([8]), (strongly) multiplicativity and the\napplications in verifiable secret-sharing (VSS) scheme and secure multi-party\ncomputation (MPC) of this construction([3] and [10-11]).

This accomplishes the program presented in\nform of conjectures in the previous paper quant-ph/0506034. Pivotal roles are\nplayed by the \"local observability principle\", which reconciles the holism of\nnonlocality with the reductionism of local observation, and by the postulated\nexistence of \"informationally complete observables\" and of a \"symmetric\nfaithful state\". This last notion allows one to introduce an operational\ndefinition for the real version of the \"adjoint\"--i. e. the transposition--from\nwhich one can derive a real Hilbert-space structure via either the\nMackey-Kakutani or the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal constructions. Here I analyze in\ndetail only the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction, which leads to a real\nHilbert space structure analogous to that of (classes of generally unbounded)\nselfadjoint operators in Quantum Mechanics. For finite dimensions, general\ndimensionality theorems that can be derived from a local observability\nprinciple, allow us to represent the elements of the real Hilbert space as\noperators over an underlying complex Hilbert space (see, however, a still open\nproblem at the end of the paper).

Zijlstra (2004) reported that the initial-final-mass\nrelation steepens at low metallicity, due to low mass-loss efficiency. This\nperhaps affects the model parameters of the AGB stars, e.g. the overlap factor\nand the neutron irradiation time, in particular at low metallicity. The\ncalculated results show indeed that the overlap factor and the neutron\nirradiation time are significantly small at low metallicities, especially for\n3.0Msun AGB stars. The scatter of [Pb/hs] found in low metallicities can\ntherefore be explained naturally when varying the initial mass of the low-mass\nAGB stars.",

Free-floating planets are\ndetected through the channel of short-duration isolated lensing events.\nHowever, if a seemingly isolated planetary event is detected, it is difficult\nto firmly conclude that the event is caused by a free-floating planet because a\nwide-separation planet can also produce an isolated event. There were several\nmethods proposed to break the degeneracy between the isolated planetary events\nproduced by the free-floating and wide-separation planets, but they are\nincomplete. In this paper, we show that free-floating planets can be securely\nidentified by conducting astrometric follow-up observations of isolated events\nto be detected in future photometric lensing surveys by using high-precision\ninterferometers to be operated contemporarily with the photometric surveys. The\nmethod is based on the fact that astrometric lensing effect covers much longer\nrange of the lens-source separation than the photometric effect. We demonstrate\nthat several astrometric follow-up observations of isolated planetary events\nassociated with source stars brighter than $V\\sim 19$ by using the {\\it Space\nInterferometry Mission} with an exposure time of $\\lesssim 10 {\\rm min}$ for\neach observation will make it possible to measure the centroid shift induced by\nprimaries with projected separations up to $\\sim 100 {\\rm AU}$.

    "summary": "In dimension $d \\geq 3$, the directed polymer in a random medium undergoes a\nphase transition between a free phase and a disorder dominated phase. For the\nlatter, Fisher and Huse have proposed a droplet theory based on the scaling of\nthe free energy fluctuations $\\Delta F(l) \\sim l^{\\theta}$. On the other hand,\nin related growth models belonging to the KPZ universality class, Forrest and\nTang have found that the height-height correlation function is logarithmic at\nthe transition. For the directed polymer model at criticality, this translates\ninto logarithmic free energy fluctuations $\\Delta F_{T_c}(l) \\sim (\\ln\nl)^{\\sigma}$ with $\\sigma=1/2$. In this paper, we propose a droplet scaling\nanalysis exactly at criticality based on this logarithmic scaling. Our main\nconclusion is that the typical correlation length $\\xi(T)$ of the low\ntemperature phase, diverges as $ \\ln \\xi(T) \\sim (- \\ln (T_c-T))^{1/\\sigma}\n\\sim (- \\ln (T_c-T))^{2} $. Furthermore, the logarithmic dependence of $\\Delta\nF_{T_c}(l)$ leads to the conclusion that the critical temperature $T_c$\nactually coincides with the explicit upper bound $T_2$ derived by Derrida and\ncoworkers, where $T_2$ corresponds to the temperature below which the ratio\n$\\bar{Z_L^2}/(\\bar{Z_L})^2$ diverges exponentially in $L$. Finally, since the\nFisher-Huse droplet theory was initially introduced for the spin-glass phase,\nwe briefly mention the similarities and differences with the directed polymer\nmodel. If one speculates that the free energy of droplet excitations for\nspin-glasses is also logarithmic at $T_c$, one obtains a logarithmic decay for\nthe mean square correlation function at criticality $\\bar{C^2(r)} \\sim 1/(\\ln r\n)^{\\sigma}$.",

As such, it requires a\npreliminary calibration of the instrument in order to obtain the calibration\nmatrix which builds the linear relationship between the interferogram and the\ninterferometric observable, that is the complex visibility. Once the\ncalibration procedure has been performed, the signal processing appears to be a\nclassical least square determination of a linear inverse problem. From the\nestimated complex visibility, we derive the squared visibility, the closure\nphase and the spectral differential phase.

This formula is\ncompared to previous formulas of Madau, Meikson, & Rees (1997) and Chen &\nMiralda-Escud\\'e (2004).",

The aim of this paper is to assess the\nexpected level of contamination in the survey of the forthcoming PLANCK\nmission. Starting from existing far-infrared (far-IR) models of the Zodiacal\nLight Emission (ZLE), we present a new method to simulate the time-dependent\nlevel of contamination from ZLE at PLANCK frequencies. We studied the\npossibility of PLANCK to detect and separate the ZLE contribution from the\nother astrophysical signals.

D.\nFrank and Jan Naudts is considered and its quantum counterpart is used to\ncalculate purity of the Werner state in nonextensive formalism. It has been\nobserved that two different expressions arise due to two different forms of\nquantum divergences. It is then argued that the difference is due to the fact\nthat the relative entropy of Bregman type is related to the first choice\nthermostatistics whereas the one of Csisz\\`{a}r type is related to the third\nchoice thermostatistics. The superiority of the third choice thermostatistics\nto the first choice thermostatistics has been deduced by noticing that the\nexpression obtained by using the Bregman type leads to negative values for\nq$\\in (0,1)$ and fidelity F smaller than 1 whereas the one obtained by using\nCsisz\\`{a}r type is free from such anomalies. Moreover, it has been noted that\nthese two measures show different qualitative behavior with respect to F.\nContrary to the classical case, the violation of the positive definiteness of\nthe relative entropy immediately results in a choice between the two\nconstraints without any need of more abstract Shore-Johnson axioms. The\npossibility of writing a relative entropy of Bregman type compatible with the\nthird choice has been investigated further.

After evaluating the\nGreen-Schwarz mechanism and deriving the generalized Donaldson-Uhlenbeck-Yau\ncondition including the five-brane moduli, we show that this construction can\ngive rise to GUT models containing U(1) factors like flipped SU(5) or directly\nthe Standard Model even on simply connected Calabi-Yau manifolds. Concrete\nrealizations of three-generation models on elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau\nmanifolds are presented. They exhibit the most attractive features of flipped\nSU(5) models such as doublet-triplet splitting and proton stability. In\ncontrast to conventional GUT string models, the tree level relations among the\nStandard Model gauge couplings at the GUT scale are changed.",

We then describe an injection of angular momentum into the halo by\nmodifying the distribution function, and show that the system evolves into a\nnew equilibrium configuration; the latter features a constant central density\nand a tangentially-dominated anisotropy profile in the inner regions, while the\nstructure is nearly unchanged beyond 10% of the virial radius. Then we propose\na toy model to account for such a halo evolution, based on the angular momentum\nexchange due to dynamical friction; at the epoch of galaxy formation this is\nefficiently exerted by the DM onto the gas clouds spiralling down the potential\nwell. The comparison between the angular momentum profile gained by the halo\nthrough dynamical friction and that provided by the perturbed distribution\nfunction reveals a surprising similarity, hinting at the reliability of the\nprocess.",

In particular, there exist infinitely many strings of k consecutive\nintegers whose phi-values are arranged from largest to smallest in any\nprescribed manner. Also, under the necessary condition ad \\ne bc, any\ninequality of the form phi(an+b) < phi(cn+d) infinitely often has k consecutive\nsolutions.

The properties of these SNe are discussed in the context of\npreviously proposed scenarios for faint SNe: low mass progenitors producing\nunder-energetic SNe; SNe with ejecta constrained by a circumstellar medium; and\noutbursts of massive Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs). The last scenario has been\nreferred to as ``Type V SNe'', ``SN impostors'' or ``fake SNe.'' The faint SN\n2002kg reached a maximum brightness of $\\mathrm{M_{V}=-9.6}$, much fainter than\nnormal type II SNe. The precursor of SN 2002kg is confirmed to be, as shown in\nprevious work, the LBV NGC2403-V37. Strong $\\mathrm{Fe II}$ lines are observed\nin the spectra of SN 2002kg, similar to both the LBV NGC2363-V1 and the type\nIIn SN 1995G. The spectrum of SN 2002kg does show strong resolved $\\mathrm{[N\nII]}$ at $\\lambda\\lambda$6549,6583\\ang. The identified progenitor of SN 2003gm\nis a bright yellow star, consistent with a F5-G2 supergiant. SN 2003gm, at the\nepoch of discovery, was of similar brightness to the possible fake SN 1997bs.\nPhotometrically SN 2003gm shows the same decrease in brightness, over the same\ntime period as SN 1997bs. The early time spectra of SN 2003gm are dominated by\nBalmer emission lines, which at the observed resolution, appear similar to SN\n2000ch. On the basis of the post-discovery photometric and spectroscopic\nobservations presented here we suggest that SN 2003gm is a similar event to SN\n1997bs. The presence of strong $\\mathrm{[N II]}$ lines, near\n$\\mathrm{H\\alpha}$, is suggested as a possible means of identifying objects\nsuch as SN 2002kg/NGC2403-V37 as being LBVs - although not as a general\nclassification criterion of all LBVs masquerading as SNe (abridged).",

    "summary": "We study the photometric and structural properties of spectroscopically\nconfirmed members in the two massive X-ray--selected z=0.83 galaxy clusters\nMS1054-03 and RXJ0152-1357 using three-band mosaic imaging with the Hubble\nSpace Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys. The samples include 105 and 140\nmembers of MS1054-03 and RXJ0152-1357, respectively, with ACS F775W magnitude <\n24.0. We develop a promising new structural classification method, based on a\ncombination of the best-fit Sersic indices and the normalized root-mean-square\nresiduals from the fits; the resulting classes agree well with the visual ones,\nbut are less affected by galaxy orientation. We examine the color--magnitude\nrelations in detail and find that the color residuals correlate with the local\nmass density measured from our weak lensing maps; we identify a threshold\ndensity of $\\Sigma \\approx 0.1$, in units of the critical density, above which\nthe star formation appears to cease. For RXJ0152-1357, we also find a trend in\nthe color residuals with velocity, resulting from an offset of about 980 km/s\nin the mean redshifts of the early- and late-type galaxies. Analysis of the\ncolor--color diagrams indicates that a range of star formation time-scales are\nneeded to reproduce the loci of the galaxy colors. We also identify some\ncluster galaxies whose colors can only be explained by large amounts, $A_V\n\\approx 1$ mag, of internal dust extinction. [Abstract shortened]",

These flaws lead to non-uniformity of the\nresulting pseudo-random numbers and consequently to noticeable deviations of\ntheir outputs from the required distributions. In addition, we show that the\nunderlying uniform PRNG of the published implementation of Matlab's\n\\texttt{randn}, which is also based on the Ziggurat method, is not uniformly\ndistributed with correlations between consecutive pairs. Also, we show that the\nsimple linear initialization of the registers in matlab's \\texttt{randn} may\nlead to non-trivial correlations between output sequences initialized with\ndifferent (related or even random unrelated) seeds. These, in turn, may lead to\nerroneous results for stochastic simulations.",

The other relationship is that\nthere is a cutoff in the gas density below which star formation shuts off.\n  The purpose of this paper is to argue that 1) these two relationships can be\naccommodated by a single functional form of the Schmidt law, and 2) this\nfunctional form is motivated by the hypothesis that star formation is a\ncritical phenomenon, and that as a corollary, 3) the existence of a sharp\ncutoff may thus be an emergent property of galaxies, as was argued by Seiden\n(1983), as opposed to the classical view that this cutoff is due to an\ninstability criterion.",

The\nradial structure of the Poynting-dominated jet is piece-wise self-similar, and\nfits to flow quantities along the field line are provided. Beyond the \\alf\nsurface at $r\\sim 10$--$100GM/c^2$, the jet becomes marginally unstable to (at\nleast) current-driven instabilities. Such instabilities drive shocks in the jet\nthat limit the efficiency of magnetic acceleration and collimation. These\ninstabilities also induce jet substructure with $3\\lesssim\\Gamma\\lesssim 15$.\nThe jet is shown to only marginally satisfy the necessary and sufficient\nconditions for kink instability, so this may explain how astrophysical jets can\nextend to large distances without completely disrupting. At large distance, the\njet angular structure is Gaussian-like (or uniform within the core with sharp\nexponential wings) with a half-opening angle of $\\approx 5^\\circ$ and there is\nan extended component out to $\\approx 27^\\circ$.

Standard assumption is that the collisionless cold dark matter (CCDM)\nparticles are represented by some weakly interacting fundamental fields which\ncan not be associated with any standard quarks or leptons. However, recent\nanalyses of structure on galactic and sub-galactic scales have suggested\ndiscrepancies and stimulated numerous alternative proposals including, e.g.\nSelf-Interacting dark matter, Self-Annihilating dark matter, Decaying dark\nmatter, to name just a few. We propose the alternative to the standard\nassumption about the nature of DM particles (which are typically assumed to be\nweakly interacting fundamental point -like particles, yet to be discovered).\nOur proposal is based on the idea that DM particles are strongly interacting\ncomposite macroscopically large objects which made of well known light quarks\n(or even antiquarks). The required weakness of the DM particle interactions is\nguaranteed by a small geometrical factor of the composite objects with a large\nbaryon charge rather than by a weak coupling constant of a new field. We argue\nthat the interaction between hadronic matter and composite dark objects does\nnot spoil the desired properties of the latter as cold matter. We also argue\nthat such a scenario does not contradict to the current observational data.\nRather, it has natural explanations of many observed data, such as\n$\\Omega_{DM}/ \\Omega_{B}\\sim 1$ or $511 KeV$ line from the bulge of our galaxy.\nWe also suggest that composite dark matter may modify the dynamics of structure\nformation in the central overdense regions of galaxies.

I summarise these recent developments\nand--in tune with the theme of this meeting--consider the clues which chemical\nabundance studies offer to the links between the high redshift galaxy\npopulations and today's galaxies. The new data are `fleshing out' the overall\npicture of element abundances at redshifts z = 2 - 3 which has been gradually\ncoming into focus over the last decade. In particular, we can now account for\nat least 40% of the metals produced by the global star formation activity in\nthe universe from the Big Bang to z = 2.5, and we have strong indications of\nwhere the remainder are likely to be found.",

Core-sized bodies undergo rapid \"Type I\" migration; for typical\nparameters their migration timescale is much shorter than their accretion\ntimescale. How, then, do growing cores avoid spiraling into the central star\nbefore they ever get the chance to become gas giants? Here, we present a simple\nmodel of core formation in a gas disk which is viscously evolving. As the disk\ndissipates, accretion and migration timescales eventually become comparable. If\nthis happens while there is still enough gas left in the disk to supply a\njovian atmosphere, then a window of opportunity for gas giant formation opens.\nWe examine under what circumstances this happens, and thus, what predictions\nour model makes about the link between proto-stellar disk properties and the\nlikelihood of forming giant planets.",

The n curves subdivide the plane\ninto 2^n open connected regions, each of which represents the intersection of\nits containing curves' sets. For example, two overlapping circles can divide\nthe plane into 4 regions representing {}, A, B, and A intersect B. Three\noverlapping circles can also be used to represent the 2^3 ways in which 3 sets\ncan intersect.\n  One of the primary questions related to Venn diagrams concerns which shapes\ncan be used for the curves. The previous examples used 2 and 3 circles, but a\n4-set Venn diagram cannot be represented by 4 circles; instead, ellipses must\nbe used.\n  In this paper, we consider Venn diagrams whose curves are the outlines of\npolyominoes. In particular, we give examples of Venn diagrams where the curves\nare rotations and translations of a single polyomino, so-called congruent\npolyVenn diagrams. We also consider the problem of area-minimization (relative\nto a scaling factor) and present examples of Venn polyominoes which minimize\narea according to various constraints.\n  At present, these examples do not generalize and so we develop an algorithm\nthat comes close to minimizing the area. The algorithm is simple and utilizes\nsymmetric chain decompositions of the Boolean lattice. We also provide\nasymptotic results that relate the area required by the algorithm's diagrams to\nthe theoretical minimum area. We conclude by presenting some open problems\nrelated to Venn polyominoes and other shape-constrained Venn diagrams.",

One kind\nof transition, the Mott transition2, occurs when the repulsive Coulomb\ninteraction between electrons is increased, causing wave-like electrons to\nbehave as particles. In two dimensions, the attractive behaviour responsible\nfor the superconductivity in high-transition temperature copper oxide3,4 and\norganic5-7 compounds appears near the Mott transition, but the universality\nclass to which two-dimensional, repulsive electronic systems belongs remains\nunknown.

The\ninfluence of accelerating process should be considered in space-time theory.\nBesides the Newtonian absolute space-time theory with invariable space-time\nscales and the Einstein relative space-time theory with variable space-time\nscales, there exists the third space-time theory, i.e., the absolute space-time\ntheory with variable space-time scales. At present, special relativity is\ndivided into two parts, kinematics and dynamics. In kinematics, force and\nacceleration are not considered so that space and time becomes relative\nconcepts. This division is completely artificial and irrational. The rational\nspace-time theory should be established on the foundation of dynamics\nconsistently. The changing rules of space, time and mass with speed should be\ndependent of accelerating processes and with absolute significance. The real\nmeaning of invariability principle of high speed should be that we can not make\nthe speed of an object speed with rest mass reach and exceed the speed of light\nin vacuum by the method of accelerating object. It is proved that the\nabsolutely resting reference frame exists. In order to eliminate multifarious\nspace-time paradoxes in special relativity, and coincide with Big-bang\ncosmology, the absolutely resting frame is necessary. A method is put forward\nto look for the absolutely resting reference frame. The isotropy reference\nframe of cosmic microwave background radiation can be regarded as the\nabsolutely resting reference frame actually at present.",

    "summary": "In mixed linear models with nonnormal data, the Gaussian Fisher information\nmatrix is called a quasi-information matrix (QUIM). The QUIM plays an important\nrole in evaluating the asymptotic covariance matrix of the estimators of the\nmodel parameters, including the variance components. Traditionally, there are\ntwo ways to estimate the information matrix: the estimated information matrix\nand the observed one. Because the analytic form of the QUIM involves parameters\nother than the variance components, for example, the third and fourth moments\nof the random effects, the estimated QUIM is not available. On the other hand,\nbecause of the dependence and nonnormality of the data, the observed QUIM is\ninconsistent. We propose an estimator of the QUIM that consists partially of an\nobserved form and partially of an estimated one. We show that this estimator is\nconsistent and computationally very easy to operate. The method is used to\nderive large sample tests of statistical hypotheses that involve the variance\ncomponents in a non-Gaussian mixed linear model. Finite sample performance of\nthe test is studied by simulations and compared with the delete-group jackknife\nmethod that applies to a special case of non-Gaussian mixed linear models.",

All three galaxy\nspectra show the Balmer/4000 Angstrom break in the rest-frame optical. The\nspectra allow us to determine spectroscopic redshifts from the continuum with\nan estimated accuracy dz/(1+z) ~ 0.001-0.04. These redshifts agree well with\nthe emission line redshifts for the 2 galaxies with Halpha emission. This\ntechnique is particularly important for galaxies that are faint in the\nrest-frame UV, as they are underrepresented in high redshift samples selected\nin optical surveys and are too faint for optical spectroscopy. Furthermore, we\nuse the break, continuum shape, and equivalent width of Halpha together with\nevolutionary synthesis models to constrain the age, star formation timescale,\ndust content, stellar mass and star formation rate of the galaxies. Inclusion\nof the NIR spectra in the stellar population fits greatly reduces the range of\npossible solutions for stellar population properties. We find that the stellar\npopulations differ greatly among the three galaxies, ranging from a young dusty\nstarburst with a small break and strong emission lines to an evolved galaxy\nwith a strong break and no detected line emission. The dusty starburst galaxy\nhas an age of 0.3 Gyr and a stellar mass of 1*10^11 Msun. The spectra of the\ntwo most evolved galaxies imply ages of 1.3-1.4 Gyr and stellar masses of\n4*10^11 Msun. The large range of properties seen in these galaxies strengthens\nour previous much more uncertain results from broadband photometry.

OH line profiles show a complex behavior evolving\nfrom pure absorption, P-Cygni type to pure emission.

From the observed profiles, mean\nintrinsic line widths and velocity offsets between emission and absorption line\npeaks we conclude that most of the excited OH arises from Orion outflow(s),\ni.e. the ``plateau'' component. We determine an averaged OH abundance relative\nto H_2 of X(OH)=(0.5-1.0)x10^-6, a kinetic temperature of 100 K and a density\nof n(H_2)=5x10^5 cm^-3.

The system is quantized by means of a natural choice\nof annihilation and creation operators. The quantum time evolution is\nconsidered and shown to be unitary, allowing both the Schr\\\"odinger and\nHeisenberg pictures to be consistently constructed. This has to be contrasted\nwith previous treatments for which time evolution failed to be implementable as\na unitary transformation.

The convective energy transport is dominated by narrow upflow\nplumes with adjacent downflows, which become almost field-free near the surface\nlayers. The strong external magnetic field forces the plumes to assume a\ncusp-like shape in their top parts, where the upflowing plasma loses its\nbuoyancy. The resulting bright features in intensity images correspond well (in\nterms of brightness, size, and lifetime) to the observed umbral dots in the\ncentral parts of sunspot umbrae. Most of the simulated umbral dots have a\nhorizontally elongated form with a central dark lane. Above the cusp, most\nplumes show narrow upflow jets, which are driven by the pressure of the\npiled-up plasma below. The large velocities and low field strengths in the\nplumes are effectively screened from spectroscopic observation because the\nsurfaces of equal optical depth are locally elevated, so that spectral lines\nare largely formed above the cusp. Our simulations demonstrate that nearly\nfield-free upflow plumes and umbral dots are a natural result of convection in\na strong, initially monolithic magnetic field.",

    "summary": "A complete set of diagnostic tools aimed at producing synthetic synchrotron\nemissivity, polarization, and spectral index maps from relativistic MHD\nsimulations is presented. As a first application we consider here the case of\nthe emission from Pulsar Wind Nebulae (PWNe). The proposed method is based on\nthe addition, on top of the basic set of MHD equations, of an extra equation\ndescribing the evolution of the maximum energy of the emitting particles. This\nequation takes into account adiabatic and synchrotron losses along streamlines\nfor the distribution of emitting particles and its formulation is such that it\nis easily implemented in any numerical scheme for relativistic MHD. Application\nto the axisymmetric simulations of PWNe, analogous to those described by Del\nZanna et al. (2004, A&A, 421, 1063), allows direct comparison between the\nnumerical results and observations of the inner structure of the Crab Nebula,\nand similar objects, in the optical and X-ray bands. We are able to match most\nof the observed features typical of PWNe, like the equatorial torus and the\npolar jets, with velocities in the correct range, as well as finer emission\ndetails, like arcs, rings and the bright knot, that turn out to arise mainly\nfrom Doppler boosting effects. Spectral properties appear to be well reproduced\ntoo: detailed spectral index maps are produced for the first time and show\nsoftening towards the PWN outer borders, whereas spectral breaks appear in\nintegrated spectra. The emission details are found to strongly depend on both\nthe average wind magnetization (here approximately 2%), and on the magnetic\nfield shape.",

We use a generalised Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with the interaction\nbetween quarks in the form of an instantaneous Lorentz-vector confining\npotential. This model is known to provide spontaneous breaking of chiral\nsymmetry in the vacuum via the standard selfenergy loops for valence quarks.\nFor highly excited hadrons, where the typical momentum of valence quarks is\nlarge, the loop contributions represent only a small correction to the\nchiral-invariant classical contributions and asymptotically vanish.\nConsequently the chiral symmetry violating Lorentz-scalar dynamical mass of\nquarks vanishes. Then the conservation of the axial vector current in the\nchiral limit requires, via the Goldberger-Treiman relation, that the valence\nquarks decouple from the Goldstone boson. As a consequence, the whole hadron\ndecouples from the Goldstone boson as well, which implies that its axial\nconstant also vanishes.",

The most promising\nacceleration mechanism cited in the literature is the transference of momentum\nand energy from Alfven waves to the gas. Usually, these models consider the\nwind to be isothermal. We present a stellar wind model in which the Alfven\nwaves are used as the main acceleration mechanism, and determine the\ntemperature profile by solving the energy equation taking into account both the\nradiative losses and the wave heating.

Its low-energy effective theory is derived with a moduli space\napproximation (MSA). The position of the two branes are parametrized by two\nscalar degrees of freedom (moduli). After detuning the brane tensions a\nclassical potential for the moduli is generated. This potential is unstable for\ndS branes and we suggest to consider as a stabilizing contribution the Casimir\nenergy of bulk fields. In particular we add a massive spinor (neutrino) field\nin the bulk and then evaluate the Casimir contribution of the bulk neutrino\nwith the help of zeta function regularization techniques. We construct an\nexplicit form of the 4D neutrino mass as function of the two moduli. To recover\nthe correct DE scale for the moduli potential the usual cosmological constant\nfine-tuning is necessary, but, once accepted, this model suggests a stronger\nconnection between DE and neutrino physics.",

In this paper the\ntemporal variation of experimentally measured profiles of atmospheric depth at\ndifferent sites is studied and implications for shower reconstruction are\nshown. The atmospheric profiles vary on time scales from hours to years.

This assumes that the normal radio\nemission of the pulse occurs in the precursor pulse. In this case, the\nlongitudes of the giant radio pulses relative to the profile of the normal\nradio emission turn out to be the same for the Crab pulsar and the millisecond\npulsar B1937+21, namely, the giant pulses arise at the trailing edge of the\nprofile of the normal radio emission.

We show that\nlow-excitation and narrow-line radio galaxies have systematically different\nnuclear X-ray properties: while narrow-line radio galaxies universally show a\nheavily absorbed nuclear X-ray component, such a heavily absorbed component is\nrarely found in sources classed as low-excitation objects. Combining our data\nwith the results of our earlier work on the z<0.1 3CRR sources, we discuss the\nimplications of this result for unified models, for the origins of mid-infrared\nemission from radio sources, and for the nature of the apparent FRI/FRII\ndichotomy in the X-ray. The lack of direct evidence for accretion-related X-ray\nemission in FRII LERGs leads us to argue that there is a strong possibility\nthat some, or most, FRII LERGs accrete in a radiatively inefficient mode.\nHowever, our results are also consistent with a model in which the accretion\nmode is the same for low- and high-excitation FRIIs, with the lower accretion\nluminosities in FRII LERGs attributed instead to more efficient radio\nluminosity production in those objects.",

    "summary": "In orbital and attitude dynamics the coordinates and the Euler angles are\nexpressed as functions of the time and six constants called elements. Under\ndisturbance, the constants are endowed with time dependence. The Lagrange\nconstraint is then imposed to guarantee that the functional dependence of the\nperturbed velocity on the time and constants stays the same as in the\nundisturbed case. Constants obeying this condition are called osculating\nelements. The constants chosen to be canonical are called Delaunay elements, in\nthe orbital case, or Andoyer elements, in the spin case. (As some Andoyer\nelements are time dependent even in the free-spin case, the role of constants\nis played by their initial values.) The Andoyer and Delaunay sets of elements\nshare a feature not readily apparent: in certain cases the standard equations\nrender them non-osculating. In orbital mechanics, elements furnished by the\nstandard planetary equations are non-osculating when perturbations depend on\nvelocities. To preserve osculation, the equations must be amended with extra\nterms that are not parts of the disturbing function. In the case of Delaunay\nparameterisation, these terms destroy canonicity. So under velocity-dependent\ndisturbances, osculation and canonicity are incompatible. (Efroimsky and\nGoldreich 2003, 2004) Similarly, the Andoyer elements turn out to be\nnon-osculating under angular-velocity-dependent perturbation. Amendment of only\nthe Hamiltonian makes the equations render nonosculating elements. To make them\nosculating, more terms must enter the equations (and the equations will no\nlonger be canonical). In practical calculations, is often convenient to\ndeliberately deviate from osculation by substituting the Lagrange constraint\nwith a condition that gives birth to a family of nonosculating elements.",

    "summary": "We study a variational problem whose critical point determines the Reeb\nvector field for a Sasaki-Einstein manifold. This extends our previous work on\nSasakian geometry by lifting the condition that the manifolds are toric. We\nshow that the Einstein-Hilbert action, restricted to a space of Sasakian\nmetrics on a link L in a Calabi-Yau cone X, is the volume functional, which in\nfact is a function on the space of Reeb vector fields. We relate this function\nboth to the Duistermaat-Heckman formula and also to a limit of a certain\nequivariant index on X that counts holomorphic functions. Both formulae may be\nevaluated by localisation. This leads to a general formula for the volume\nfunction in terms of topological fixed point data. As a result we prove that\nthe volume of a Sasaki-Einstein manifold, relative to that of the round sphere,\nis always an algebraic number. In complex dimension n=3 these results provide,\nvia AdS/CFT, the geometric counterpart of a-maximisation in four dimensional\nsuperconformal field theories. We also show that our variational problem\ndynamically sets to zero the Futaki invariant of the transverse space, the\nlatter being an obstruction to the existence of a Kahler-Einstein metric.",

Luminous, massive stars of spectral type earlier than B4 are\nlikely to be those that benefit most from the existence of accretion disks,\nwhich may significantly reduce the effect of radiation pressure on the\naccreting material. The scope of the present contribution is to review the\ncurrent knowledge about disks in young high-mass (proto)stars and discuss their\nimplications. The issues of disk stability and lifetime are also discussed. We\nconclude that for protostars of less than ~20 solar masses, disks with mass\ncomparable to that of the central star are common. Above this limit the\nsituation is unclear and there are no good examples of proto O4-O8 stars\nsurrounded by accretion disks: in these objects only huge, massive, toroidal,\nnon-equilibrium rotating structures are seen. It is clear on the other hand\nthat the observed disks in stars of 10-20 solar masses are likely to be\nunstable and with short lifetimes.",

With the aid of extreme and simplified\ntheoretical models of clustering evolution we show that it is unlikely that the\ntwo samples are drawn from the same population observed at two different stages\nof evolution. High-z DRGs likely represent the progenitors of the more massive\nand more luminous galaxies in the local Universe and might mark the regions\nthat will later evolve into structures of intermediate mass, like groups or\nsmall galaxy clusters.

Using both\ncommonly used functionals in the correlated band approach (LDA+U) as well as\nthe local density approximation (LDA),the combined effects of correlation and\nhybridization with O 2p states are calculated and analyzed. Sr$_2$CoO$_2$ is\nalready ferromagnetic within LDA (M=1.95 $\\mu_B$). Increasing U from zero, the\ntwo LDA+U schemes affect the moment oppositely out to a critical value\n$U_c$=2.5 eV, at which point they transform discontinuously from different\nstates to the same large U state. Fixing U at $U_c$, fixed spin moment\ncalculations show similar behavior out to a minimum at 1$\\mu_B$ (a half\nmetallic state), beyond which the fully-localized-limit scheme jumps to a state\nwith energy minimum very near 2$\\mu_B$ very close to the LDA moment). Although\nthe energy minima occur very near integer values of the moment/Co (1$\\mu_B,\n2$\\mu_B$), the strong 3d-2p mixing and resulting 3d orbital occupations seem to\npreclude any meaningful S=1/2 or S=1 assignment to the Co ion.",

During low to high state transitions, a\nnearly constant magnitude difference was observed in all three polars. This\n$\\Delta$m value was found to be consistent with the level expected to occur if\naccretion onto the white dwarf reached the Eddington luminosity during the high\nstate. The high state Balmer decrement was measured for each star and used to\nestimate that the temperature of the emission line forming region was ~12,000K\nwith N$_H$ near 12.8 dex.

If a CMB map is contaminated by the SZ\neffect of galaxies or galaxy clusters, the CMB maps should have similar\nnon-Gaussian features as the galaxy and cluster fields. Using the WMAP data and\n2MASS galaxy catalog we show that the non-Gaussianity of the 2MASS galaxies is\nimprinted on WMAP maps. The signature of non-Gaussianity can be seen with the\n4^{th} order cross correlation between the wavelet variables of the WMAP maps\nand 2MASS clusters. The intensity of the 4^{th} order non-Gaussian features is\nfound to be consistent with the contamination of the SZ effect of 2MASS\ngalaxies. We also show that this non-Gaussianity can not be seen by the high\norder auto-correlation of the WMAP. This is because the SZ signals in the\nauto-correlations of the WMAP data generally is weaker than the WMAP-2MASS\ncross correlations by a factor f^2, which is the ratio between the powers of SZ\neffect map and the CMB fluctuations on the scale considered. Therefore, the\nratio of high order auto-correlations of CMB maps to cross-correlations of the\nCMB maps and galaxy field would be effective to constrain the powers of SZ\neffect on various scales.",

Here we\npresent the results from the first chemical models of the outer regions (R >\n100 AU) of protoplanetary disks to consider the effects of turbulence driven\ndiffusive mixing in the vertical direction. We show that vertical diffusion can\ngreatly affect the column densities of many species, increasing them by factors\nof up to two orders of magnitude. Previous disk models have shown that disks\ncan be divided into three chemically distinct layers, with the bulk of the\nobserved molecular emission coming from a region between an atomic/ionic layer\non the surface of the disk and the midplane regoin where the bulk of molecules\nare frozen onto grains. Diffusion retains this three layer structure, but\nincreases the depth of the molecular layer by bringing atoms and atomic ions\nform by photodissociation in the surface layers into the shielded molecular\nlayer where molecules can reform. For other species, notably NH3 and N2H+, the\ncolumn densities are relatively unaffected by diffusion. These species peak in\nabundance near the midplane where most other molecules are heavily depleted,\nrather than in the molecular layer above. Diffusion only affects the abundances\nof those molecules with peak abundances in the molecular layer. We find that\ndiffusion does not affect the ionization fraction of the disk. We compare the\ncalculated column densities to observations of DM Tau, LkCa 15 and TW Hya and\nfind good agreement for many molecules with a diffusion coefficient of 1e18\ncm^2 s^-1.",

    "summary": "We estimate the total number and the slope of the size frequency distribution\n(SFD) of dormant Jupiter Family Comets (JFCs) by fitting a one-parameter model\nto the known population. We first select 61 Near Earth Objects (NEOs) that are\nlikely to be dormant JFCs because their orbits are dynamically coupled to\nJupiter (Bottke et al, 2002). Then, from the numerical simulations of Levison &\nDuncan (1997), we construct an orbit distribution model for JFCs in the NEO\norbital element space. We assume an orbit independent SFD for all JFCs, the\nslope of which is our unique free parameter. Finally, we compute observational\nbiases for dormant JFCs using a calibrated NEO survey simulator (Jedicke et al.\n2003). By fitting the biased model to the data, we estimate that there are ~75\ndormant JFCs with H<18 in the NEO region and that the slope of their cumulative\nSFD is -1.5 +/- 0.3. Our slope for the SFD of dormant JFCs is very close to\nthat of active JFCs as determined by Weissman and Lowry (2003). Thus, we argue\nthat when JFCs fade they are likely to become dormant rather than to disrupt\nand that the fate of faded comets is size independent. Our results imply that\nthe size distribution of the JFC progenitors - the scattered disk\ntrans-Neptunian population - either (i) has a similar and shallow SFD or (i')\nis slightly steeper and physical processes acting on the comets in a\nsize-dependent manner creates the shallower active comet SFD. Our measured\nslope, typical of collisionally evolved populations with a size dependent\nimpact strength (Benz and Asphaug 1999), suggests that scattered disk bodies\nreached collisional equilibrium inside the proto-planetary disk prior to their\nremoval from the planetary region.",

We have suggested that the optimized initial growth condition for\nthe growth of the Ga-polarity GaN crystal on the O-terminated ZnO(000-1)\nsurface is under the suitable low temperature and the stoichiometric growth\ncondition. Experimental observations show that GaN grown on ZnO(000-1) by PLD\nat substrate temperatures below 300C has Ga-polarity, which is quite consistent\nwith the theoretical calculations",

A new idea we recently\nintroduced, very high redundancy, alleviates this problem. It enables the\nrelatively simple construction (~1cm mechanical precision) of a ground-based\nastronomical facility able to transform a two-dimensional field of point-like\nsources to a three-dimensional distribution of micro-arcsec resolved systems,\neach imaged in several optical bands. Each system will also have its high\nresolution residual timing, high quality (inside each band) spectra and light\ncurve, emergent flux, effective temperature, polarization effects and perhaps\nsome thermodynamic properties, all directly measured. All the above attributes\ncan be measured in a single observation run of such a dedicated facility.

The age\ndynamics of relaxation processes is quantitatively described by means of local\nrelaxation parameters, calculated by the specific localization procedure.

In particular, we\nhave revealed basic laws, suggesting a cosmo-physical nature of these\nphenomena, in the time series created by the noise generators of the global GCP\nnet. On the basis of all the results obtained, a conclusion has been made that\nthe histogram form is determined by fluctuations of the spacetime, which depend\non the movement of the measured system (laboratory) relative to the heavenly\nbodies. An important step to understand the nature of these phenomena was the\nfinding that at the moments of the new Moon, a specific histogram form appears\npractically simultaneously at different geographical points, from Arctic to\nAntarctic, in middle latitudes of West and East hemispheres. This effect seems\nto be not due to a change of the tide-generating forces; to explain it,\nnontrivial hypotheses are needed. The present paper shows the appearance of\nspecific histogram forms at the culminations of the solar eclipses (moments of\nthe geocentric superposition of the Sun and the Moon), with the eclipse forms\ndiffering from the new-moon ones. Specific histogram forms appear practically\nsimultaneously all over the Earth and depend nor on the geographical\ncoordinates, nor on the nature of the process studied.",

One spectacular property of phase\nchirality imprinting is the created ability of the network to adsorb\npreferentially one stereo-component from a racemic mixture. In this paper we\nexplore this property of chirality transfer from a macroscopic to the molecular\nscale.

Two types of models are proposed: (i) images are converted\ninto complex networks by considering pixels as nodes while connections are\nestablished in terms of fields of influence defined by visual features such as\ntangent fields induced by gray-level contrasts and distance; and (ii) image\npixels exhibiting particularly distinctive values of visual properties such as\ngray-level intensity, contrast, size of objects, orientation and texture are\nmapped into nodes and the weights of links are defined in order to favor\ntransitions between regions with similar or different visual features, also\ntaking the distance between the nodes into account. Preferential random walks\nare performed on such networks in order to emulate attentional shifts and eye\nmovements, and the saliency of each region is obtained in terms of the\nfrequency of visits to each node at equilibrium. In the case of the first\nmodel, there is a definite tendency to emphasize not only high curvature points\nbut also convergences of the tangent field. The frequency of visits is found to\nbe strongly correlated with the node degrees (strengths) for this model.\nDifferent results have been obtained for the second model as a consequence of\nthe directed and asymmetric nature of the respectively obtained networks.",

As the IMC we suggest the statistical spectrum of the non-Markovity\nparameter (NMP) and its frequency behavior. Our preliminary studies of real\ncomplex systems in cardiology, neurophysiology and seismology have shown that\nthe NMP has diverse frequency dependence. It testifies to the competition\nbetween Markovian and non-Markovian, random and regular processes and makes a\ncrossover from one relaxation scenario to the other possible. On this basis we\ncan formulate the new concept in the study of the manifestation of chaoticity.\nWe suggest the statistical theory of discrete non-Markov stochastic processes\nto calculate the NMP and the quantitative evaluation of the IMC in real complex\nsystems. With the help of the IMC we have found out the evident manifestation\nof chaosity in a normal (healthy) state of the studied system, its sharp\nreduction in the period of crises, catastrophes and various human diseases. It\nmeans that one can appreciably improve the state of a patient (of any system)\nby increasing the IMC of the studied live system.

Two incarnations of this\nfundamental plane have so far been suggested using different underlying models\nand using two different samples of accreting black holes. We present revised\nsamples for both studies together with a refined statistical analysis using\nmeasured errors of the observables. This method is used to compare the two\nsamples, discuss selection effects, and infer parameters for the fundamental\nplane in a homogeneous way. We show that strongly sub-Eddington objects in a\nstate equivalent to the low/hard state of X-ray binaries follow the fundamental\nplane very tightly; the scatter is comparable to the measurement errors.\nHowever, we find that the estimated parameters depend strongly on the\nassumptions made on the sources of scatter and the relative weight of the\ndifferent AGN classes in the sample. Using only hard state objects, the\nfundamental plane is in agreement with the prediction of a simple uncooled\nsynchrotron/jet model for the emitted radiation. Inclusion of high-state\nobjects increases the scatter and moves the correlation closer to a disk/jet\nmodel. This is qualitatively consistent with a picture where low-state objects\nare largely dominated by jet emission while high-state objects have a strong\ncontribution from an accretion disk.",

As an exception Skyrme's model succeeded to\ndescribe nuclear particles as localized states, so-called 'skyrmions', within a\nnon-linear field theory. Skyrmions are a characteristic of non-linear continuum\nmodels ranging from microscopic to cosmological scales. Skyrmionic states have\nbeen found under non-equilibrium conditions, or when stabilised by external\nfields or the proliferation of topological defects. Examples are Turing\npatterns in classical liquids, spin textures in quantum Hall magnets, or the\nblue phases in liquid crystals, respectively. However, it is believed that\nskyrmions cannot form spontaneous ground states like ferromagnetic or\nantiferromagnetic order in magnetic materials. Here, we show theoretically that\nthis assumption is wrong and that skyrmion textures may form spontaneously in\ncondensed matter systems with chiral interactions without the assistance of\nexternal fields or the proliferation of defects. We show this within a\nphenomenological continuum model, that is based on a few material-specific\nparameters that may be determined from experiment. As a new condition not\nconsidered before, we allow for softened amplitude variations of the\nmagnetisation - a key property of, for instance, metallic magnets. Our model\nimplies that spontaneous skyrmion lattice ground states may exist quite\ngenerally in a large number of materials, notably at surfaces and in thin films\nas well as in bulk compounds, where a lack of space inversion symmetry leads to\nchiral interactions.",

The physical\nnature of the gradient terms of our generalized micromagnetic model for\nferromagnets with softened longitudinal fluctuations is explained. The\nrelationship of our micromagnetic model with the spin fluctuation theory of\nitinerant-electron magnets is discussed. Experimental estimates of the\nparameter eta, which accounts for an effective reduced longitudinal stiffness,\nare presented for real materials from published polarized neutron scattering\nexperiments on EuS, Ni and MnSi. The available experimental data clearly show\nthat eta is significantly reduced for the latter two systems. It is suggested\nthat particle-hole excitations are at the root of this longitudinal softness in\nitinerant-electron ferromagnets. The current status of the experimental\nevidence supporting spontaneous, amorphous skyrmion textures in MnSi and other\nmaterials is reviewed. Finally, we also address the general potential of\nskyrmion textures in chiral magnets for other fields of physics.",

Taking into\naccount both interfaces, a disorder potential for the exciton motion in the\nquantum well plane is derived. The excitonic optical properties are calculated\nusing either a time-propagation of the excitonic polarization with a\nphenomenological dephasing, or a full exciton eigenstate model including\nmicroscopic radiative decay and phonon scattering rates. While the results of\nthe two methods are generally similar, the eigenstate model does predict a\ndistribution of dephasing rates and a somewhat modified spectral response.\nComparing the results with measured absorption and resonant Rayleigh scattering\nin GaAs/AlAs quantum wells subjected to growth interrupts, their specific\ndisorder parameters like correlation lengths and interface flatness are\ndetermined. We find that the long-range disorder in the two heterointerfaces is\nhighly correlated, having rather similar average in-plane correlation lengths\nof about 60 and 90 nm. The distribution of dephasing rates observed in the\nexperiment is in agreement with the results of the eigenstate model. Finally,\nwe simulate highly spatially resolved optical experiments resolving individual\nexciton states in the deduced interface structure.",

We propose a logic for reasoning about knowledge of\nunawareness, by extending Fagin and Halpern's \\emph{Logic of General\nAwareness}. The logic allows quantification over variables, so that there is a\nformula in the language that can express the fact that ``an agent explicitly\nknows that there exists a fact of which he is unaware''. Moreover, that formula\ncan be true without the agent explicitly knowing that he is unaware of any\nparticular formula.

We investigate the physical properties of the\nRosette HH1 jet using high-quality narrow-band images and high-dispersion\nspectroscopy. The new images show that the axis of the jet is not precisely\naligned with the star near the base of the jet. The high resolution of the\nspectra allows us to accurately determine the contributions from the \\ion{H}{2}\nregion, jet, and star. The appoaching and receding sides of the expanding shell\nof the Rosette Nebula are at heliocentric velocities of 13 and 40 km s$^{-1}$,\nwhile the jet reaches a maximum velocity offset at a heliocentric velocity of\n$-$30 km s$^{-1}$. The [\\ion{S}{2}] doublet ratios indicate an electron density\nof $\\sim$1000 cm$^{-3}$ in the jet and $\\le$100 cm$^{-3}$ in the \\ion{H}{2}\nregion. With a careful subtraction of the nebular and jet components, we find\nthe stellar H$\\alpha$ line is dominated by a broad absorption profile with\nlittle or no emission component, indicating a lack of substantial circumstellar\nmaterial. The circumstellar material has most likely been photo-evaporated by\nthe strong UV radiation field in the Rosette Nebula. The evaporation time scale\nis 10$^3$ -- 10$^4$ yr. The Rosette HH1 jet source provides evidence for an\naccelerated evolution from a CTTS to a WTTS due to the strong UV radiation\nfield; therefore, both CTTSs and WTTSs can be spatially mixed in regions with\nmassive star formation.",

We propose a functional\nregression approach for this situation, using functional principal component\nanalysis, where we estimate the functional principal component scores through\nconditional expectations. This allows the prediction of an unobserved response\ntrajectory from sparse measurements of a predictor trajectory. The resulting\ntechnique is flexible and allows for different patterns regarding the timing of\nthe measurements obtained for predictor and response trajectories. Asymptotic\nproperties for a sample of $n$ subjects are investigated under mild conditions,\nas $n\\to \\infty$, and we obtain consistent estimation for the regression\nfunction. Besides convergence results for the components of functional linear\nregression, such as the regression parameter function, we construct asymptotic\npointwise confidence bands for the predicted trajectories. A functional\ncoefficient of determination as a measure of the variance explained by the\nfunctional regression model is introduced, extending the standard $R^2$ to the\nfunctional case. The proposed methods are illustrated with a simulation study,\nlongitudinal primary biliary liver cirrhosis data and an analysis of the\nlongitudinal relationship between blood pressure and body mass index.",

This remnant\ncontains the most energetic pulsar known (PSR J0537-6910), which is surrounded\nby a bright nonthermal nebula that likely represents a toroidal pulsar wind\nterminal shock observed edge-on. We confirm the non-thermal nature of the\ncomet-shaped X-ray emission feature and show that the spectral steepening of\nthis feature away from the pulsar is quantitatively consistent with synchrotron\ncooling of shocked pulsar wind particles flowing downstream at a bulk velocity\nclose to the speed of light. Around the cometary nebula we unambiguously detect\na thermal component, which accounts for about 1/3 of the total 0.5 - 10 keV\nflux from the remnant. This thermal component is distributed among various\nclumps of metal-enriched plasma embedded in the low surface brightness\nX-ray-emitting diffuse gas. The relative metal enrichment pattern suggests that\nthe mass of the supernova progenitor is >~ 20M_sun. A comparison of the X-ray\ndata with HST optical images suggests that the explosion site is close to a\ndense cloud, against which a reflection shock is launched. The interaction\nbetween this reflection shock and the nebula has likely produced both its\ncometary shape and the surrounding thermal emission enhancement. SNR N157B is\napparently expanding into the hot low-density interior of a surrounding\nsuperbubble formed by the young OB association LH99, as revealed by Spitzer\nmid-infrared images. This scenario naturally explains the exceptionally large\nsizes of both the thermal and nonthermal components as well as the lack of an\nouter shell of the SNR.

We find a\nsurprising competition between two oscillating patterns, where one is harmonic\nand the other subharmonic with respect to the spatially periodic forcing. The\noccurrence of a subharmonic pattern is remarkable as well as its preference up\nto rather large values of the modulation amplitude. For small modulation\namplitudes we derive from the model system a generic equation for the envelope\nof the oscillating reaction that includes an additional forcing contribution,\ncompared to the amplitude equations known from previous studies in other\nsystems. The analysis of this amplitude equation allows the derivation of\nanalytical expressions even for the forcing corrections to the threshold and to\nthe oscillation frequency, which are in a wide range of parameters in good\nagreement with the numerical analysis of the complete reaction equations. In\nthe nonlinear regime beyond threshold, the subharmonic solutions exist in a\nfinite range of the control parameter that has been determined by solving the\nreaction equations numerically for various sets of parameters.",

At lower nucleon energies, the optical-potential\nphilosophy is preferred, whereas at higher energies the Glauber method is more\nnatural. This versatility in dealing with the IFSI allows one to describe\nA(p,pN) reactions in a wide energy range. Most results presented here use\noptical potentials as this approach is argued to be the optimum choice for the\nkinematics of the experiments considered in the present paper. The properties\nof the IFSI factor, a function wherein the entire effect of the IFSI is\ncontained, are studied in detail. The predictions of the presented framework\nare compared with two kinematically different experiments. First, differential\ncross sections for quasielastic proton scattering at 1 GeV off 12C, 16O, and\n40Ca target nuclei are computed and compared to data from PNPI. Second, the\nformalism is applied to the analysis of a 4He(p,2p) experiment at 250 MeV.

A previous investigation of the effects of the competition\nbetween attraction and repulsion on the liquid-vapour transition and on the\ncorrelations is extended to the study of the stability of liquid-vapour phase\nseparation with respect to freezing. We find that this long-range repulsive\npart of the interaction expands the region where the fluid-solid transition\npreempts the liquid-vapour one, so that the critical point becomes metastable\nat longer attraction ranges than those required for purely attractive\npotentials. Moreover, the large density fluctuations that occur near the\nliquid-vapour critical point are greatly enhanced by the competition between\nattractive and repulsive forces, and encompass a much wider region than in the\nattractive case. The decay of correlations for states where the compressibility\nis large is governed by two characteristic lengths, and the usual\nOrnstein-Zernike picture breaks down except for the very neighborhood of the\ncritical point, where one length reduces to the commonly adopted correlation\nlength, while the other one saturates at a finite value.",

We show\nthat while these all have similar spectral evolution as a function of mass\naccretion rate, there are also subtle differences. There are two different\ntypes of hard/soft transition, those where the spectrum softens at all\nenergies, leading to a diagonal track on a colour-colour diagram, and those\nwhere only the higher energy spectrum softens, giving a vertical track. The\nluminosity at which the transition occurs is correlated with this spectral\nbehaviour, with the vertical transition at L/L_Edd ~0.02 while the diagonal one\nis at ~0.1. Superimposed on this is the well known hysteresis effect, but we\nshow that classic, large scale hysteresis occurs only in the outbursting\nsources, indicating that its origin is in the dramatic rate of change of mass\naccretion rate during the disc instability. We show that the long term mass\naccretion rate correlates with the transition behaviour, and speculate that\nthis is due to the magnetic field being able to emerge from the neutron star\nsurface for low average mass accretion rates. While this is not strong enough\nto collimate the flow except in the millisecond pulsars, its presence may\naffect the inner accretion flow by changing the properties of the jet.",

These shocks are associated with an\nunstable, chaotic wind. The main improvement with respect to earlier models is\nthe inclusion of the radial dependence of the shock velocity jump and\ncompression ratio, based on 1D hydrodynamical simulations. The decrease of the\nvelocity jump and the compression ratio as a function of radius produces a\nrapidly decreasing synchrotron emissivity. This effectively prohibits the\nmodels from reproducing the spectral shape of the observed non-thermal radio\nemission. We investigate a number of \"escape routes\" by which the\nhydrodynamical predictions might be reconciled with the radio observations.\nAlthough these escape routes reproduce the observed spectral shape, none of\nthese escape routes are physically plausible. In particular, re-acceleration by\nfeeding an electron distribution through a number of shocks, is in\ncontradiction with current hydrodynamical simulations. These hydrodynamical\nsimulations have their limitations, most notably the use of 1D. At present, it\nis not feasible to perform 2D simulations of the wind out to the distances\nrequired for synchrotron-emission models. Based on the current hydrodynamic\nmodels, we suspect that the observed non-thermal radio emission from O stars\ncannot be explained by wind-embedded shocks associated with the instability of\nthe line-driving mechanism. The most likely alternative mechanism is\nsynchrotron emission from colliding winds. That would imply that all O stars\nwith non-thermal radio emission should be members of binary or multiple\nsystems.",

First, this\nmechanism is developed on the basis of a phenomenological approach. This model\nnot only allows the qualitative description of the switching mechanism, but it\nis in quantitative agreement with the experimental results, in particular, with\nthose concerning the critical concentration and threshold field. The mechanism\ntakes into account the dependence of the carrier density on electric field, as\nwell as the scaling of the critical field. Next, we show that such a\n'macroscopic' approach can be supported by some microscopic model. The\nquintessence of this approach consists in the fact that an electronically\ninduced metal-insulator transition may be described in terms of\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) formalism developed earlier for the charge\ndensity wave concept. It is shown that for the combination of both the types of\ninteraction (electron-electron and electron-phonon), the formation of a\ncollective excitation - an electron crystal of charge density wave - in the\nmodel of exciton insulator is possible, which, in a general case, can also be\naccompanied by a structural transition. The results for vanadium dioxide are\nexamined within the frameworks of the developed approach.",

To perform the path integrals, one should, however, note that the\noverlap fermion determinant has discontinuities where the topology is\nill-defined, its locality is doubtful, and the numerical cost is suddenly\nenhanced.\n  An interesting solution would be to concentrate on a fixed topological sector\nin the full configuration space. In this thesis, we test a gauge action which\nautomatically satisfies Luescher's admissibility condition, as well as an\nadditional (large) negative mass Wilson fermion action in the quenched study\n(with no light quark). Both of them would keep the topology along the HMC\nsimulations. The quark potential and the topology stability are investigated\nwith different lattice sizes and different couplings.\n  The results of quenched QCD in the $\\epsilon$-regime are also presented as an\nexample of the lattice studies with fixed topology. Remarkable quark mass and\ntopology dependences of meson correlators allow us to determine the fundamental\nparameters of the effective theory, in which the exact chiral symmetry with the\nGinsparg Wilson relation plays a crucial role.",

In the first part\nwe specify the conditions under which the force on a particle is a well defined\nstochastic quantity.

In the second part of the paper we extend to\nthis class of particle distributions the method introduced by Chandrasekhar to\nstudy the force probability density function in the homogeneous Poisson\nparticle distribution. In this way we can derive an approximate expression for\nthe probability distribution of the force over the full range of perturbations\nof the lattice, i.e., from very small (compared to the lattice spacing) to very\nlarge where the Poisson limit is recovered. We show in particular the\nqualitative change in the large-force tail of the force distribution between\nthese two limits.

For both cases the center of the potentials coincide with the\ndyon's position.

Significantly different structural models for\nPZT with $x$ in the vicinity of the MPB have recently been published.\nStructural models, based on x-ray, neutron and electron diffraction studies,\nare reviewed and two essentially different approaches were identified: (i) a\nmethod where space group symmetry was decreased untill the features due to the\nlocal distortions were 'modelled' and (ii) a method where the highest space\ngroup symmetry compatible with the powder diffraction data was used together\nwith a model for a local disorder. Related to the method (ii), the essential\nfeatures of a model taking the hkl-dependent line broadening into account are\nsummarized. The underlying theme is to consider how local regions, with\nsymmetry lower than the average symmetry, should be modelled.

The invariant regular functions\n$\\mathbb{C}[V]^G$ inherit a Poisson algebra structure and so the quotient\nvariety ${\\cal X}=V/G$ becomes then an affine algebraic Poisson variety. One\ncan now consider the non commutative deformation of $\\cal X$ given by the\ninvariant algebra $A_l(\\mathbb{C})^G$, where $A_l(\\mathbb{C})$ stands for the\nWeyl algebra of rank $l$. There exist two families of natural examples of this\nsituation. The first concerns wreath products of a finite subgroup of\n$SL(2,\\mathbb{C})$ with an appropriate symmetric group acting on\n$(\\mathbb{C}^2)^n$; the second family is constructed with a Weyl group $W$\nacting on the double of the reflexion representation ${\\mathfrak{h}}\\oplus\n{\\mathfrak{h}}^*$. A nice result of Berest, Etingof and Ginzburg establishes\nthe finiteness of the dimension of $HP_0({\\cal X})= \\mathbb{C}[\\cal\nX]/\\{\\mathbb{C}[\\cal X], \\mathbb{C}[\\cal X]\\}$, the Poisson trace group of\n$\\cal X$. The purpose of this work is to compute this dimension in certain\ncases and in particular to compare it to the dimension of the usual trace group\nof the above mentioned non commutative deformation. The principal theorem\nestablihed here is : {\\bf Theorem.} With the above notations, we have the\nfollowing equality: $$dim_\\mathbb{C} HP_0({{\\mathfrak{h}}\\oplus\n{\\mathfrak{h}}^*}/W)=dim_\\mathbb{C} HH_0(A_l(\\mathbb{C})^W).$$ Moreover, this\ncommon dimension is 1 in type $ A_2$, 2 in type $B_2$ and 3 in type $G_2$.

The method combines\npower spectral measurements of thermal motion and the response to a sinusoidal\nmotion of a translation stage. It consequently does not use the drag\ncoefficient of the trapped ob ject as an input. Thus, neither the viscosity,\nnor the size of the trapped ob ject, nor its distance to nearby surfaces need\nto be known. The method requires only a low level of instrumentation and can be\napplied in situ in all spatial dimensions. It is both accurate and precise:\ntrue values are returned, with small error-bars. We tested this experimentally,\nnear and far from surfaces. Both position- and force-calibration were accurate\nto within 3%. To calibrate, we moved the sample with a piezo-electric\ntranslation stage, but the laser beam could be moved instead, e.g. by\nacousto-optic deflectors. Near surfaces, this precision requires an improved\nformula for the hydrodynamical interaction between an infinite plane and a\nmicro-sphere in non-constant motion parallel to it. We give such a formula.",

The aim of our observations is to understand the processes\nforming the observed large abundances of methanol and formaldehyde in low-mass\nprotostellar envelopes (gas-phase processes ? chemistry on the grain surfaces\n?) and better constrain the chemical models. Methods : Using the IRAM 30m\nsingle-dish telescope, we observed deuterated formaldehyde (HDCO and D2CO) and\nmethanol (CH2DOH, CH3OD, and CHD2OH) towards a sample of seven low-mass class 0\nprotostars. Using population diagrams, we then derive the fractionation ratios\nof these species (abundance ratio between the deuterated molecule and its main\nisotopologue) and compare them to the predictions of grain chemistry models.\nResults : These protostars show a similar level of deuteration as in\nIRAS16293-2422, where doubly-deuterated methanol -- and even triply-deuterated\nmethanol -- were first detected. Our observations point to the formation of\nmethanol on the grain surfaces, while formaldehyde formation cannot be fully\npined down. While none of the scenarii can be excluded (gas-phase or grain\nchemistry formation), they both seem to require abstraction reactions to\nreproduce the observed fractionations.",

We demonstrate that source-channel (or source-network)\nseparation holds for several canonical network examples like the noisy multiple\naccess channel and the erasure degraded broadcast channel, when the whole\nnetwork operates over a common finite field. This robustness of separation is\npredicated on the fact that noise and inputs are independent, and we examine\nthe failure of separation when noise is dependent on inputs in multiple access\nchannels.\n  Our approach is based on the sufficiency of linear codes. Using a simple and\nunifying framework, we not only re-establish with economy the optimality of\nlinear codes for single-transmitter, single-receiver channels and for\nSlepian-Wolf source coding, but also establish the optimality of linear codes\nfor multiple access and for erasure degraded broadcast channels. The linearity\nallows us to obtain simple optimal code constructions and to study capacity\nregions of the noisy multiple access and the degraded broadcast channel. The\nlinearity of both source and network coding blurs the delineation between\nsource and network codes. While our results point to the fact that separation\nof source coding and channel coding is optimal in some canonical networks, we\nshow that decomposing networks into canonical subnetworks may not be effective.\nThus, we argue that it may be the lack of decomposability of a network into\ncanonical network modules, rather than the lack of separation between source\nand channel coding, that presents major challenges for coding over networks.",

    "summary": "Stochastic acceleration of electrons interacting resonantly with a turbulent\nmagnetic field in a small accretion torus appears to be the likely mechanism\nresponsible for much of Sagittarius A*'s millimeter and shorter wavelength\nspectrum. The longer wavelength radiation is produced at larger radii by\nelectrons either diffusing from smaller scales or accelerated in situ. An\nimportant prediction of this model is the ejection of a significant flux of\nrelativistic protons from a magnetic-field-dominated acceleration site into the\nwind-shocked medium surrounding the black hole. Recently, several air Cerenkov\ntelescopes, notably HESS, have detected TeV emission from the Galactic center,\nwith characteristics hinting at a p-p-induced pion decay process for the\n\\gamma-ray emission. Given (1) the size of this acceleration region measured in\nthe radio band and (2) the wind-injected ISM mapped with Chandra using the\ndiffuse X-rays, it is feasible to test the idea that protons accelerated within\n\\~20 Schwarzschild radii of the black hole produce the TeV emission farther\nout. We show a fraction of TeV protons scattering about once within ~3 pc of\nSagittarius A* and the proton power (~10^37 erg s^-1) produced in concert with\nthe 7 mm radio emission matches the TeV luminosity well. This model explains\nwhy the TeV source does not vary on a timescale of a year or less. The particle\ncascade generated by the p-p scatterings also produces bremsstrahlung, inverse\nCompton, and synchrotron emission at longer wavelengths from secondary\nparticles. We compare these with current measurements and demonstrate that\nGLAST will detect this source during its one-year all-sky survey.",

    "summary": "We examine the pattern of star birth in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), with\nthe goal of discerning the cluster's formation mechanism. Outside of the\nTrapezium, the distribution of stellar masses is remarkably uniform, and is not\naccurately described by the field-star initial mass function. The deconvolved,\nthree-dimensional density of cluster members peaks at the Trapezium stars,\nwhich are truly anomalous in mass. Using theoretical pre-main-sequence tracks,\nwe confirm the earlier finding that star formation has accelerated over the\npast 10 Myr. We further show that the rate of acceleration has been the same\nfor all masses. Thus, there is no correlation between stellar age and mass,\ncontrary to previous claims. Finally, the acceleration has been spatially\nuniform throughout the cluster. Our reconstruction of the parent molecular\ncloud spawning the cluster shows that it had a mass of 6700 solar masses prior\nto its destruction by the Trapezium. If the cloud was supported against\nself-gravity by mildly dissipative turbulence, then it contracted in a\nquasi-static, but accelerating manner. We demonstrate this contraction\ntheoretically through a simple energy argument. The mean turbulent speed\nincreased to its recent value, which is reflected in the present-day stellar\nvelocity dispersion. The current ONC will be gravitationally unbound once cloud\ndestruction is complete, and is destined to become a dispersing OB association.\nWe hypothesize that similarly crowded groups seen at the centers of distant OB\nassociations are also unbound, and do not give rise to the Galactic population\nof open clusters. Finally, accelerating star formation implies that most clumps\nwithin giant molecular complexes should have relatively low formation activity.\nSensitive infrared surveys could confirm this hypothesis.",

If the classical\nnetwork is fast enough, the chain-like network of N communicators can generate\nand share an N bit long secret key within a single clock period of the ciphers\nand that implies a significant speed-up compared to the point-to-point key\nexchanges used by quantum communication or RSA-like key exchange methods.

Our\nmodel consists of a particle trapped in a cubic potential interacting with an\nenvironment characterized by dissipative and normal and anomalous diffusion\ncoefficients. A representation based on the energy eigenfunctions of the\nisolated system, i.e. the system uncoupled to the environment, is used to write\nthe reduced Wigner function, and the master equation becomes simpler in that\nrepresentation. The energy eigenfunctions computed in a WKB approximation\nincorporate the tunneling effect of the isolated system and the effect of the\nenvironment is described by an equation that it is in many ways similar to a\nFokker-Planck equation. Decoherence is easily identified from the master\nequation and we find that when the decoherence time is much shorter than the\ntunneling time the master equation can be approximated by a Kramers like\nequation describing thermal activation due to the zero point fluctuations of\nthe quantum environment. The effect of anomalous diffusion can be dealt with\nperturbatively and its overall effect is to inhibit tunneling.",

    "summary": "One of the most active areas of physics in the last decades has been that of\ncritical phenomena, and Monte Carlo simulations have played an important role\nas a guide for the validation and prediction of system properties close to the\ncritical points. The kind of phase transitions occurring for the Betts lattice\n(lattice constructed removing 1/7 of the sites from the triangular lattice)\nhave been studied before with the Potts model for the values q=3, ferromagnetic\nand antiferromagnetic regime. Here, we add up to this research line the\nferromagnetic case for q=4 and 5. In the first case, the critical exponents are\nestimated for the second order transition, whereas for the latter case the\nhistogram method is applied for the occurring first order transition.\nAdditionally, Domany's Monte Carlo based clustering technique mainly used to\ngroup genes similar in their expression levels is reviewed. Finally, a control\ntheory tool --an adaptive observer-- is applied to estimate the exponent\nparameter involved in the well-known Gompertz curve. By treating all these\nsubjects our aim is to stress the importance of cooperation between distinct\ndisciplines in addressing the complex problems arising in biology.\n  Contents: Chapter 1 - Monte Carlo simulations in stat. physics; Chapter 2: MC\nsimulations in biology; Chapter 3: Gompertz equation",

This large effect is seen\nto arise dominantly at low energy from the extra contributions made by massless\npions at energies near the physical threshold where the physical spectral\nfunction must vanish kinematically.

The particular case $n=0$ describes the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model\nwhereas $n=2$ stands for the Chen and Wu model. For an estimated age of 2 Gyr,\nit is found that the power index has a lower limit $n> 0.21$, whereas for 3 Gyr\nthe limit is $n > 0.6$. Since $n$ can not be so large as $\\sim 0.81$, the\n$\\Lambda$CDM and Chen and Wu models are also ruled out by this analysis. The\nsecond class of models is the one recently proposed by Wang and Meng which\ndescribes several $\\Lambda(t)$CDM cosmologies discussed in the literature. By\nassuming that the true age is 2 Gyr it is found that the $\\epsilon$ parameter\nsatisfies the lower bound $\\epsilon > 0.11$, while for 3 Gyr, a lower limit of\n$\\epsilon > 0.52$ is obtained.

We pay particular\nattention to the black hole (BH) formation case and to the resulting mass of\nthe surrounding disk for exploring possibility for formation of the central\nengine of short-duration gamma-ray bursts. Hybrid equations of state (EOSs) are\nadopted mimicking realistic, stiff nuclear EOSs, for which the maximum allowed\ngravitational mass of cold and spherical neutron stars (NSs), M_sph, is larger\nthan 2M_sun. For the simulations, we focus on BNSs of the ADM mass M>2.6M_sun.\nFor M>M_thr, the merger results in prompt formation of a BH irrespective of the\nmass ratio Q_M with 0.65<Q_M<1. The value of M_thr is approximately written as\n1.3-1.35M_sph for the chosen EOSs. For the BH formation case, we evolve the\nspacetime using a BH excision technique and determine the mass of a\nquasistationary disk surrounding the BH. The disk mass steeply increases with\ndecreasing the value of Q_M for given ADM mass and EOS. For M<M_thr, the\noutcome is a hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) of a large ellipticity. If the\nHMNS collapses to a BH after the longterm angular momentum transport, the disk\nmass may be >0.01M_sun. Gravitational waves (GWs) are computed in terms of a\ngauge-invariant wave extraction technique. In the formation of the HMNS,\nquasiperiodic GWs of frequency (3-3.5kHz) are emitted. The effective amplitude\nof GWs can be >5x10^{-21} at a distance of 50 Mpc. For the BH formation case,\nthe BH excision technique enables a longterm computation and extraction of\nring-down GWs associated with a BH quasinormal mode. It is found that the\nfrequency and amplitude are 6.5-7kHz and 10^{-22} at a distance of 50Mpc for\nM=2.7-2.9M_sun.",

With the aid of earlier data, from Oct 1997 to Oct 2002,\nwe track the local evolution of Ly-alpha emission and both the local and global\nevolution of H-alpha emission. In addition to emission which we can clearly\nattribute to the surface of the reverse shock, we also measure comparable\nemission, in both H-alpha and Ly-alpha, which appears to emerge from supernova\ndebris interior to the surface. New observations taken through slits positioned\nslightly eastward and westward of a central slit show a departure from\ncylindrical symmetry in the H-alpha surface emission. Using a combination of\nold and new observations, we construct a light curve of the total H-alpha flux,\nF, from the reverse shock, which has increased by a factor ~ 4 over about 8\nyears. However, due to large systematic uncertainties, we are unable to discern\nbetween the two limiting behaviours of the flux - F ~ t (self-similar\nexpansion) and F ~ t^5 (halting of the reverse shock). Such a determination is\nrelevant to the question of whether the reverse shock emission will vanish in\nless than about 7 years (Smith et al. 2005). Future deep, low- or\nmoderate-resolution spectra are essential for accomplishing this task.",

We then compare our new method to previously adopted\nmeans of identifying subhalos by applying each to a sample of 1838 virialized\nhalos extracted from a high resolution cosmological simulation. We find that\nthe subhalo distributions are similar in each case, and that the increase in\nthe binding energy of a subhalo from including all the particles located within\nit is almost entirely balanced by the losses due to the external forces; the\nnet increase in the mass fraction of subhalos is roughly 10%, and the extra\nsubstructures tending to reside in the inner parts of the system. Finally, we\ncompare the subhalo populations of halos to the sub-subhalo populations of\nsubhalos, finding the two distributions to be similar. This is a new and\ninteresting result, suggesting a self-similarity in the hierarchy substructures\nwithin cluster mass halos.",

Here, we propose a new strategy based on the detection\nof neutrinos from Dark Matter annihilations in 'mini-spikes' around\nIntermediate Mass Black Holes. Neutrino fluxes, in this case, depend on the\nannihilation cross-section of Dark Matter particles, whereas solar and\nterrestrial fluxes are sensitive to the scattering cross-section off nucleons,\na circumstance that makes the proposed search complementary to the existing\nones. We discuss the prospects for detection with upcoming under-water and\nunder-ice experiments such as ANTARES and IceCube, and show that several, up to\nmany, sources could be detected with both experiments. A kilometer scale\ntelescope in the Mediterranean appears to be ideally suited for the proposed\nsearch.",

    "summary": "(Abridged) We investigate the power of void statistics to constrain galaxy\nbias and the amplitude of dark matter fluctuations. We use the halo occupation\ndistribution (HOD) framework to describe the relation between galaxies and dark\nmatter. After choosing HOD parameters that reproduce the mean space density\nn_gal and projected correlation function w_p measured for galaxy samples with\nM_r<-19 and M_r<-21 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we predict the\nvoid probability function (VPF) and underdensity probability function (UPF) of\nthese samples by populating the halos of a large, high-resolution N-body\nsimulation. If we make the conventional assumption that the HOD is independent\nof large scale environment at fixed halo mass, then models constrained to match\nn_gal and w_p predict nearly identical void statistics, independent of the\nscatter between halo mass and central galaxy luminosity or uncertainties in HOD\nparameters. Models with sigma_8=0.7 and sigma_8=0.9 also predict very similar\nvoid statistics. However, the VPF and UPF are sensitive to environmental\nvariations of the HOD in a regime where these variations have little impact on\nw_p. For example, doubling the minimum host halo mass in regions with large\nscale (5 Mpc/h) density contrast delta<-0.65 has a readily detectable impact on\nvoid probabilities of M_r<-19 galaxies, and a similar change for delta<-0.2\nalters the void probabilities of M_r<-21 galaxies at a detectable level. The\nVPF and UPF provide complementary information about the onset and magnitude of\ndensity- dependence in the HOD. By detecting or ruling out HOD changes in low\ndensity regions, void statistics can reduce systematic uncertainties in the\ncosmological constraints derived from HOD modeling, and, more importantly,\nreveal connections between halo formation history and galaxy properties.",

From these couplings, all scalar fields including\nthe neutral scalar $h$ and the Goldstone bosons can be identified and their\ncouplings with the usual gauge bosons such as the photon, the charged $W^\\pm$\nand the neutral $Z$, without any additional condition, are recovered. In the\neffective approximation, full content of scalar sector can be recognized. The\nCP-odd part of Goldstone associated with the neutral non-Hermitian bilepton\ngauge boson $G_{X^0}$ is decouple, while its CP-even counterpart has the mixing\nby the same way in the gauge boson sector. Masses of the new neutral Higgs\nboson $H^0_1$ and the neutral non-Hermitian bilepton $X^0$ are dependent on a\ncoefficient of Higgs self-coupling ($\\lambda_1$). Similarly, masses of the\nsingly-charged Higgs boson $H_2^\\pm$ and of the charged bilepton $Y^\\pm$ are\nproportional through a coefficient of Higgs self-interaction ($\\lambda_4$). The\nhadronic cross section for production of this Higgs boson at the LHC in the\neffective vector boson approximation is calculated.

Optical and near infrared spectroscopy demonstrate that\nthis source is of later spectral type than the esdM7 APMPM 0559-2903, with the\npresence of strong alkali lines (including Rb I), VO absorption at 7400 A and\nH2O absorption at 1.4 microns. Current optical classification schemes yield a\nspectral type of esdM8, making LEHPM 2-59 one of only two ultracool esdMs\nknown. The substantial space velocity of this object (V_galactic ~ -180 km/s)\nidentifies it as a halo star. Spectral model fits to the optical and near\ninfrared spectral data for this and four other late-type esdMs indicate that\nLEHPM 2-59 is the coolest esdM currently known, with Teff = 2800-3000 K and\n-1.5 <~ [M/H] <~ -2.0. Comparison of Teff determinations for M dwarfs and esdMs\nbased on spectral model fits from this study and the literature demonstrate a\ndivergence in Teff scales beyond spectral types M5/esdM5, as large as 600-800 K\nby types M8/esdM8. While this divergence is likely an artifact of the\nunderlying classification scheme, it may lead to systematic errors in the\nderived properties of intermediate metallicity subdwarfs. We comment on the\nfuture of ultracool subdwarf classification, and suggest several ideas for\naddressing shortcomings in current (largely extrapolated) schemes.",

Here, we present high-resolution spectroscopic data of pure rotational\nlines of water vapor at 12 microns for the supergiant mu Cephei. This star has\noften been used to test the concept of molecular layers around supergiants.\nGiven the prediction of an isothermal, optically thick water-vapor layer in\nLocal Thermodynamic Equilibrium around the star (MOLsphere), we expected the 12\nmicron lines to be in emission or at least in absorption but filled in by\nemission from the molecular layer around the star. Our data, however, show the\ncontrary; we find definite absorption. Thus, our data do not easily fit into\nthe suggested isothermal MOLsphere scenario. The 12 micron lines, therefore,\nput new, strong constraints on the MOLsphere concept and on the nature of water\nseen in signatures across the spectra of early M supergiants. We also find that\nthe absorption is even stronger than that calculated from a standard,\nspherically symmetric model photosphere without any surrounding layers. A cool\nmodel photosphere, representing cool outer layers is, however, able to\nreproduce the lines, but this model does not account for water vapor emission\nat 6 microns. Thus, a unified model for water vapor on mu Cephei appears to be\nlacking. It does seem necessary to model the underlying photospheres of these\nsupergiants in their whole complexity.

The stellar warp phase-angle\norientation (+15 degrees) is close to the orientation angle of the Galactic bar\nand this produces an asymmetric warp for the inner rings; (iv) a\nNorthern/Southern warp symmetry is observed only for the ring at 17 kpc; (v)\ntreating a mixture of thin and thick disk populations we trace the disk flaring\nand derive a constant scale-height (~0.65 kpc) within R(GC)~15 kpc. Further\nout, the disk flaring increase gradually reaching a mean scale-height of ~1.5\nkpc at R(GC)~23 kpc; and (vi) these results provide further robust evidence\nthat there is no disk radial truncation at R(GC)~14 kpc.\n  In the particular case of the Canis Major over-density we confirm its\ncoincidence with the Southern stellar maximum warp occurring near l=240. We\npresent evidence to conclude that all observed parameters (e.g. number density,\nradial velocities, proper motion etc) of CMa are consistent with it being a\nnormal Milky Way outer-disk population, thereby leaving no justification for a\nmore complex interpretations of its origin. The present analysis does not\nprovide a conclusive test of the structure or origin of the Monoceros Ring.\nNevertheless, we show that a warped flared Milky Way contributes significantly\nat the locations of the Monoceros Ring.",

In order to follow the emission behaviour of the source\nin detail, a large multiwavelength campaign was organized by the Whole Earth\nBlazar Telescope (WEBT). Continuous optical, near-IR and radio monitoring was\nperformed in several bands. ToO pointings by the Chandra and INTEGRAL\nsatellites provided additional information at high energies in May 2005. The\nhistorical radio and optical light curves show different behaviours. Until\nabout 2001.0 only moderate variability was present in the optical regime, while\nprominent and long-lasting radio outbursts were visible at the various radio\nfrequencies, with higher-frequency variations preceding the lower-frequency\nones. After that date, the optical activity increased and the radio flux is\nless variable. This suggests that the optical and radio emissions come from two\nseparate and misaligned jet regions, with the inner optical one acquiring a\nsmaller viewing angle during the 2004-2005 outburst. Moreover, the colour-index\nbehaviour (generally redder-when-brighter) during the outburst suggests the\npresence of a luminous accretion disc. A huge mm outburst followed the optical\none, peaking in June-July 2005. The high-frequency (37-43 GHz) radio flux\nstarted to increase in early 2005 and reached a maximum at the end of our\nobserving period (end of September 2005).

In particular,\nthe near-IR (0.8 - 2.3 micron) spectrum, obtained for the first time, shows a\nlarge variety of emission features of the HI and HeI recombination and CO\novertone. By comparing the observed spectrum with a wind model, a mass loss\nrate value is derived along with other parameters whose values are typical of\nan accreting T Tauri star. In addition, we have used X-ray data from the XMM\narchive, taken in two different epochs during the declining phase monitored in\nIR. X-ray emission (in the range 0.5 - 10 keV) permits to derive several\nparameters which confirm the T Tauri nature of the source. In the near-IR the\nobject maintains a low visual extinction during all the activity phases,\nconfirming that variable extinction does not contribute to brightness\nvariations. The lack of both a significant amount of circumstellar material and\nany evidence of IR cooling from collimated jet/outflow driven by the source,\nindicates that, at least this member of the EXor class, is in a late stage of\nthe Pre-Main Sequence evolution. In the X-ray regime, an evident fading is\npresent, detected in the post-outburst phase, that cannot be reconciled with\nthe presence of any absorbing material. This circumstance, combined with the\npersistence (in the pre- and post-outburst phases) of a temperature component\nat about 10 MK, suggests that accretion has some influence in regulating the\ncoronal activity.",

The properties of the jets\nare determined by their interaction with the disk wind. The precession of the\ndisk and jets, as well as the eclipsing in the binary system, make SS433 a\nunique laboratory for studies of mechanisms for the microquasar phenomenon.\nEssentially all photometric and spectroscopic properties of SS433 are\ndetermined by the accretion disk and its orientation, but the disk itself is\nnot observed, being located beneath the photosphere of the dense wind.\nObservational manifestations of the wind and of gas flows in the system are\ndescribed.

This model, called ESC04, describes NN and YN in a\nunified way using broken flavor SU(3)-symmetry. Novel ingredients are the\ninclusion of (i) the axial-vector-mesons, (ii) a zero in the scalar- and\naxial-vector meson form factors. We describe simultaneous fits to the NN- and\nYN-data, using four options in the ESC-model. Very good fits were obtained.\nG-matrix calculations with these four options are also reported. The obtained\nwell depths (U_\\Lambda, U_\\Sigma, U_\\Xi) reveal distinct features of ESC04a-d.\nThe \\Lambda\\Lambda-interactions are demonstrated to be consistent with the\nobserved data of_{\\Lambda\\Lambda}^6He.

We show that not only does the\ncharge transfer appear already at the fundamental level of the inter-molecular\nH\\\"uckel model, but also that the spatial distribution of the change in the\nelectron density is well described already at this level of theory. We find\nthat the charge transfer between the walls is on the order of 0.001 e/atom and\nthat the inner tube is always negatively charged. We also observe orbital\nmixing between the states of the layers. We find that these two effects\ncombined can in some cases lead to a semiconductor--to--metal transition of the\ndouble walled tube, but not necessarily in all cases.",

Based on the color parameter delta C_{12}\nand the decline rate delta m_{15}, we found that the average absorption to\nreddening ratio for SN Ia host galaxies to be R_{UBVI} = 4.37+/-0.25,\n3.33+/-0.11, 2.30+/-0.11, 1.18+/-0.11, which are systematically lower than the\nstandard values in the Milky Way. We investigated the correlations of the\nintrinsic luminosity with light curve decline rate, color index, and supernova\nenvironmental parameters. In particular, we found SNe Ia in E/S0 galaxies to be\nbrighter close to the central region than those in the outer region, which may\nsuggest a possible metallicity effect on SN luminosity. The dependence of SN\nluminosity on galactic environment disappears after corrections for the\nextinction and delta C_{12}. The Hubble diagrams constructed using 73 Hubble\nflow SNe Ia yield a 1-sigma scatter of <0.12 mag in BVI bands and ~0.16 mag in\nU band. The luminosity difference between normal SNe Ia and peculiar objects\n(including SN 1991bg-like and 1991T-like events) has now been reduced to within\n0.15 mag via delta C_{12} correction. We use the same precepts to correct the\nnearby SNe Ia with Cepheid distances and found that the fully corrected\nabsolute magnitudes of SNe Ia are: M_{B} = -19.33+/-0.06 mag, M_{V} =\n-19.27+/-0.05 mag.

In this paper, we\ninvestigate the event and time scale characteristics of the normal and two\npathologic fetal heart rate groups with the help of the new measure, called the\nUnit Time Block Entropy(UTBE), which approximates the entropy at each event and\ntime scale based on symbolic dynamics. This method enables us to match the\nmeasurement time and the number of words between fetal heart rate data sets\nsimultaneously.

We explore the possibility that, at the\ncluster age, some MS and PMS stars still present infrared excesses related to\ndust envelopes and proto-planetary discs. The radial density profile follows\nKing's law with a core radius $\\rm\\rc=0.7\\pm0.1 pc$ and a limiting radius\n$\\rm\\rl=6.9\\pm0.1 pc$; the cluster age is $\\rm14\\pm2 Myr$. Field-star\ndecontamination reveals a low-MS limit at $\\rm\\approx1.4 \\ms$. The core MF\n($\\chi=0.94\\pm0.16$) is flatter than the halo's ($\\chi=1.58\\pm0.11$). NGC 4755\ncontains $\\rm\\sim285$ candidate PMS stars of age $\\rm\\sim1 - 15 Myr$, and a few\nevolved stars. The mass locked up in PMS, MS and evolved stars amounts to\n$\\rm\\sim1150 \\ms$. Proper motions show that \\ks-excess MS and PMS stars are\ncluster members. \\ks-excess fractions in PMS and MS stars are $\\rm5.4\\pm2.1%$\nand $\\rm3.9\\pm1.5%$ respectively, consistent with the cluster age. The core is\ndeficient in PMS stars, as compared with MS ones. NGC 4755 hosts binaries in\nthe halo but they are scarce in the core. Compared to open clusters in\ndifferent dynamical states studied with similar methods, NGC 4755 fits\nrelations involving structural and dynamical parameters in the expected locus\nfor its age and mass. On the other hand, the flatter core MF probably\noriginates from primordial processes related to parent molecular cloud\nfragmentation and mass segregation over $\\rm\\sim14 Myr$. Star formation in NGC\n4755 began $\\rm\\approx14 Myr$ ago and proceeded for about the same length of\ntime. Detection of \\ks-excess emission in member MS stars suggests that some\ncircumstellar dust discs survived for $\\rm\\sim10^7 yr$, occurring both in some\nMS and PMS stars for the age and spread observed in NGC 4755.",

The three Spitzer/MIPS bands\nare well suited to measuring the gradient in temperature and the total optical\ndepth in the disk of a spiral galaxy. Another way to estimate the quantity of\ndust in a spiral disk is the \"Synthetic Field Method\" (SFM, Gonzalez et al.\n1998), which uses the number of distant field galaxies seen through the disk of\nthe nearby spiral. The optical depth estimated from this method can be compared\nto the values derived from the FIR emission. Since the two techniques depend on\ndifferent assumptions regarding the dust geometry and emissivity, this\ncomparison between the optical depth profiles can potentially shed light on the\nstructure and quantity of the ISM in spiral disks, especially any colder\ncomponents. The dust responsible for the opacity from distant galaxy counts\nappears to be predominantly cold (T < 20 K.). The differences between the\nradial absorption profiles can be explained by spiral arms in the SFM\nmeasurements. Taken over the same aperture, galaxy counts show higher\nextinction values than the FIR derived ones. The implications for dust geometry\ncan hopefully be explored with a more rigorous estimate of dust mass from the\nFIR fluxes.",

    "summary": "Efficient automatic protein classification is of central importance in\ngenomic annotation. As an independent way to check the reliability of the\nclassification, we propose a statistical approach to test if two sets of\nprotein domain sequences coming from two families of the Pfam database are\nsignificantly different. We model protein sequences as realizations of Variable\nLength Markov Chains (VLMC) and we use the context trees as a signature of each\nprotein family. Our approach is based on a Kolmogorov--Smirnov-type\ngoodness-of-fit test proposed by Balding et al. [Limit theorems for sequences\nof random trees (2008), DOI: 10.1007/s11749-008-0092-z]. The test statistic is\na supremum over the space of trees of a function of the two samples; its\ncomputation grows, in principle, exponentially fast with the maximal number of\nnodes of the potential trees. We show how to transform this problem into a\nmax-flow over a related graph which can be solved using a Ford--Fulkerson\nalgorithm in polynomial time on that number. We apply the test to 10 randomly\nchosen protein domain families from the seed of Pfam-A database (high quality,\nmanually curated families). The test shows that the distributions of context\ntrees coming from different families are significantly different. We emphasize\nthat this is a novel mathematical approach to validate the automatic clustering\nof sequences in any context. We also study the performance of the test via\nsimulations on Galton--Watson related processes.",

The NIR images trace the mass of the galaxies, through the oldest and\nmore evolved stellar populations. The goal of this project is to search for\nevidence of morphological perturbations correlated with the level of activity\n(AGN or star formation) of the galaxies. We find that the level of perturbation\nis well correlated with activity observed in optical spectrocopy (Coziol et al.\n2004). Evidence for perturbations decreases from more active groups to less\nactive groups, confirming the classification. Our analysis suggests that\ngalaxies in more active groups are undergoing important transformations due to\ninteraction and merging and that the whole groups is on a merger path. Galaxies\nin less active CG have gone through similar processes in the recent past and\nare either in a final merging phase or in equilibrium due to a more massive\nhalo of dark matter.",

By choosing the (walk)\nstarting site as a reference state, the Terwilliger algebra connected with this\nchoice turns the graph into the metric space, hence stratifies the graph into a\n(d+1) disjoint union of strata, where the amplitudes of observing the\ncontinuous-time quantum walk on all sites belonging to a given stratum are the\nsame. In graphs of association schemes with known spectrum, the transition\namplitudes and average probabilities are given in terms of dual eigenvalues of\nassociation schemes. As most of association schemes arise from finite groups,\nhence the continuous-time walk on generic group association schemes have been\nstudied in great details, where the transition amplitudes are given in terms of\ncharacters of groups. Further investigated examples are the walk on graphs of\nassociation schemes of symmetric $S_n$, Dihedral $D_{2m}$ and cyclic groups.\nAlso, following Ref.\\cite{js}, the spectral distributions connected to the\nhighest irreducible representations of Terwilliger algebras of some rather\nimportant graphs, namely distance regular graphs, have been presented.

It has been developed the evolutionary method\nthat enables one to describe the process of obtaining closed exterior forms.\n  The process of obtaining closed exterior forms discloses the mechanism of\nevolutionary processes in material media and shows that material media\ngenerate, discretely, the physical structures, from which the physical fields\nare formed. This justifies the quantum character of field theories.\n  On the other hand, this process demonstrates the connection between field\ntheories and the equations for material media and points to the fact that the\nfoundations of field theories must be conditioned by the properties of material\nmedia. It is shown that the external and internal symmetries of field theories\nare conditioned by the degrees of freedom of material media.

In the type II Randall-Sundrum braneworld gravity model, the extra\ndimension modifies the spacetime geometry around black holes, and changes\npredictions for the formation and survival of primordial black holes. We\ndevelop a comprehensive analytical formalism for far-field black hole lensing\nin this model, using invariant quantities to compute all geometric optics\nlensing observables. We then make the first analysis of wave optics in\nbraneworld lensing, working in the semi-classical limit. We show that wave\noptics offers the only realistic way to observe braneworld effects in black\nhole lensing. We point out that if primordial braneworld black holes exist,\nhave mass M, and contribute a fraction f of the dark matter, then roughly 3e5 x\nf (M/1e-18 Msun)^(-1) of them lie within our Solar System. These objects, which\nwe call \"attolenses,\" would produce interference fringes in the energy spectra\nof gamma-ray bursts at energies ~100 (M/1e-18 Msun)^(-1) MeV (which will soon\nbe accessible with the GLAST satellite). Primordial braneworld black holes\nspread throughout the universe could produce similar interference effects; the\nprobability for \"attolensing\" may be non-negligible. If interference fringes\nwere observed, the fringe spacing would yield a simple upper limit on M.\nDetection of a primordial black hole with M <~ 1e-19 Msun would challenge\ngeneral relativity and favor the braneworld model. Further work on lensing\ntests of braneworld gravity must proceed into the physical optics regime, which\nawaits a description of the full spacetime geometry around braneworld black\nholes.",

The similarity of the effective\ninteraction to the widely used SkM$^*$ force encourages us to apply it to a\nwide range of nuclear problems, beginning with the binding energies and charge\ndistributions of doubly magic nuclei. Finding acceptable results in this\nconventional arena, we apply the same effective interaction, within the\nHartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approach, to the properties of nuclei far from\nstability.

After providing some orientation among the large\nvariety of models, we first revisit the central role of the N_1DS, with new\ninsights on the dynamics of the asymmetry generation and then discuss the main\nroutes departing from it, focusing on models beyond the HL. We study in detail\ntwo examples of `strong-strong' wash-out scenarios: one with `maximal phase'\nand the limit of very large M_3, studying the effects arising when\ndelta_2=(M_2-M_1)/M_1 is small. We extend analytical methods already applied to\nthe N_1DS showing, for example, that, in the degenerate limit (DL), the\nefficiency factors of the RH neutrinos become equal with the single decay\nparameter replaced by the sum. Both cases disprove the misconception that close\nRH neutrino masses necessarily lead to a final asymmetry enhancement and to a\nrelaxation of the lower bounds on M_1 and on the initial temperature of the\nradiation-dominated expansion.

The doubly-scaled theory consists of two\ndecoupled sectors, one whose spectrum and interactions follow the usual large-N\nscaling whilst the other has light states of fixed mass in the large-N limit\nwhich subvert the usual large-N scaling and lead to an interacting theory in\nthe limit. $F$-term properties of this interacting sector can be calculated\nusing a Dijkgraaf-Vafa matrix model and in this context the double-scaling\nlimit is precisely the kind investigated in the \"old matrix model'' to describe\ntwo-dimensional gravity coupled to $c<1$ conformal field theories.

The objects were selected by\ncross-correlating the IRAS Faint Source Catalog with the VLA FIRST catalog and\nthe HST Guide Star Catalog to allow for adaptive optics observations. We found\ntwo new ULIGs (with L_FIR equal to or greater than 10^{12} L_sun) and 19 new\nLIGs (with L_FIR equal to or greater than 10^{11} L_sun). Twenty of the\ngalaxies in the sample were imaged with either the Lick or Keck adaptive optics\nsystems in H or K'. Galaxy morphologies were determined using the two\ndimensional fitting program GALFIT and the residuals examined to look for\ninteresting structure. The morphologies reveal that at least 30% are involved\nin tidal interactions, with 20% being clear mergers. An additional 50% show\nsigns of possible interaction. Line ratios were used to determine powering\nmechanism; of the 17 objects in the sample showing clear emission lines - four\nare active galactic nuclei and seven are starburst galaxies. The rest exhibit a\ncombination of both phenomena.",

In our study we critically test a\nphenomenological model for the FIR-radio correlation which describes the radio\nimage as a smeared version of the infrared image. The physical basis for this\nmodel is that cosmic-ray electrons (CR electrons) will diffuse significant\ndistances from their originating sources before decaying by synchrotron\nemission. We find that this description generally works well, improving the\ncorrelation between the radio and infrared images of our four sample galaxies\nby an average factor of $\\sim$1.6. We also find that the best-fit smearing\nkernels seem to show a dependence on the ongoing star formation activity within\neach disk. Galaxies having lower star formation activity (NGC 2403 and NGC\n3031) are best-fit using larger smearing kernels than galaxies with more active\nstar-forming disks (NGC 5194 and NGC 6946). We attribute this trend to be due\nto a recent deficit of CR electron injection into the interstellar medium of\ngalaxies with lower star formation activity throughout their disks.",

We revisit\nthe issue of a large running spectral index, first by reexamining the evidence\nfrom the data, and then by reconstructing the inflationary potential, using an\nimproved method based upon the Hamilton-Jacobi formulation. We note that a\nspectrum which runs only over 1.5 decades of k space provides as good a fit to\nthe CMB data as one which runs at all k, that significant evidence for running\ncomes from multipoles l near 40, and that large running gives a better fit than\na flat spectrum primarily if the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ is large, r ~ 0.5,\nand the field values are at the Planck scale. This allows one to break the\nlarge degeneracy of potentials which would be consistent with the scalar power\nalone. Large running, should it be confirmed, is thus linked to a high scale of\ninflation and the possibility of seeing effects of tensor modes in the CMB and\nPlanck-scale physics. Nevertheless, we show that the reconstructed inflaton\npotential is well-described by a renormalizable potential whose quantum\ncorrections are under control despite the large field values.",

We\nhave analyzed archival ISOSWS spectra of the DR21 outflow, and compare them to\nupdated H2 shocked and UV-excitation models. We find that H2 line emission\ncontributes about 50% of the flux of the IRAC bands at 3.6 um, 4.5 um , and 5.8\num, and is a significant contributor to the 8.0 um band as well, and confirm\nthat the outflow contains multiple excitation mechanisms. Other potentially\nstrong features, in particular Br alpha and CO emission, have been suggested as\ncontributing to IRAC fluxes in outflows, but they are weak or absent in DR21;\nsurprisingly, there also is no evidence for strong PAH emission. The results\nimply that IRAC images can be a powerful detector of, and diagnostic for,\noutflows caused by massive star formation activity in our galaxy, and in other\ngalaxies as well. They also suggest that IRAC color-color diagnostic diagrams\nmay need to take into account the possible influence of these strong emission\nlines.

We use a large\nsample of published light curves to calibrate the relations between the\nabsolute magnitudes at maximum and delta_m15 in BVRI filters.

The lens electrodes are shaped to produce only\nsextupole plus dipole equipotentials which avoids adding the unnecessary\nnonlinear forces present in cylindrical lenses. Defocusing between lenses is\ngreatly reduced by having all of the main electric fields point in the same\ndirection and be of nearly equal magnitude. The addition of the third lens gave\nus better control of the focusing strength in the two transverse planes and\nallowed focusing of the beam to half the image size in both planes. The beam\nenvelope was calculated for lens voltages selected to produced specific\nfocusing properties. The calculations, starting from first principles, were\ncompared with measured beam sizes and found to be in good agreement.\nApplication to fountain experiments, atomic clocks, and focusing polar\nmolecules in strong-field-seeking states is discussed.",

How do these rare starbursting systems, which contribute\nsignificantly to high redshift star-formation, relate to other galaxy\npopulations? Deep radio observations have been most useful for studying these\nsystems, but still leave a significant fraction of the population unidentified.\nNow with the deep IRAC and MIPS images from the GOODS Spitzer Legacy program\nand a re-analysis of the deep radio data, we are able to identify counterparts\nfor a large fraction of SCUBA galaxies in GOODS-N. All of these counterparts\nare detected by Spitzer. Given the vast multi-wavelength data in this field, we\ncan study the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of these systems and\ndetermine what is fueling their intense infrared luminosities. A rest-frame\ncomposite optical-to-radio SED for all spectroscopically identified submm\nsources shows that the average SCUBA galaxy is consistent with models of\nultraluminous starburst galaxies, although cooler than those observed locally.\nBecause of this, the submm flux alone consistently overestimates IR when using\nspectral templates which obey the local ULIRG temperature-luminosity relation.\nThe wide range of 24/850 micron flux ratios as a function of redshift indicates\nthe presence of strong mid-IR features, to be confirmed with deep IRS\nspectroscopy. The IRAC colours of the submm systems provide useful redshift\nconstraints, since, at these redshifts, IRAC samples the stellar bump.

    "summary": "Diffusion effect on chirality selection in a two-dimensional\nreaction-diffusion model is studied by the Monte Carlo simulation. The model\nconsists of achiral reactants A which turn into either of the chiral products,\nR or S, in a solvent of chemically inactive vacancies V. The reaction contains\nthe nonlinear autocatalysis as well as recycling process, and the chiral\nsymmetry breaking is monitored by an enantiomeric excess $\\phi$.\n  Without dilution a strong nonlinear autocatalysis ensures chiral symmetry\nbreaking. By dilution, the chiral order $\\phi$ decreases, and the racemic state\nis recovered below the critical concentration $c_c$. Diffusion effectively\nenhances the concentration of chiral species, and $c_c$ decreases as the\ndiffusion coefficient $D$ increases. The relation between $\\phi$ and $c$ for a\nsystem with a finite $D$ fits rather well to an interpolation formula between\nthe diffusionless(D=0) and homogeneous ($D=\\infty$) limits.",

Here we extend previous calculations \\cite{anderson87,FC\nZhang,Randeria} to study more systematically low energy physical properties of\nthe plain vanilla d-wave RVB state, and to compare results with the available\nexperiments. We use a renormalized mean field theory combined with variational\nMonte Carlo and power Lanczos methods to study the RVB state of an extended\n$t-J$ model in a square lattice with parameters suitable for the hole doped\nCu-oxides. The physical observable quantities we study include the specific\nheat, the linear residual thermal conductivity, the in-plane magnetic\npenetration depth, the quasiparticle energy at the antinode $(\\pi, 0)$, the\nsuperconducting energy gap, the quasiparticle spectra and the Drude weight.

Using the Chandra\n2Msec X-ray image centered on the GOODS-N field and a reprocessed VLA HDF\nA-array data plus newly acquired VLA B-array data (rms=5.3microJy), we find\nthat radio galaxies (with spectroscopic redshifts; all have z>1) with\nL(1.4GHz)>1E24 W/Hz typically have an X-ray detection rate of 72% (60% emit\nhard X-rays suggesting an AGN origin for the radio emission) in contrast to 25%\nfor radio galaxies with L < 1E23 W/Hz. The ACS images of these L(1.4 GHz) >\n1E24 W/Hz galaxies typically show compact rather than extended galaxy\nmorphology which is generally found for the less luminous radio emitting\ngalaxies but a few appear to be ongoing galaxy mergers. We also present SED\nfitting for these luminous radio galaxies including Spitzer IRAC & MIPS 24um\nphotometry and 60% show distinct power-law SED indicative of an AGN. Initial\nresults tell us that the X-ray emitting radio galaxy population are generally\nnot submm sources but the few (~10%) that are SCUBA sources appear to be the\nsmall AGN population found by Pope et al. and others.",

We present maps of the disk in both 12CO (3-2) and dust\ncontinuum at 345 GHz with the SMA at an angular resolution of 1.0\"x0.7\" (144AU\nx 100AU). The continuum emission traces a dust disk with a central depression\nand a maximum overall dimension of 450AU (FWHM). This dust disk exhibits\nseveral distinct peaks that appear to coincide with bright features in the\nnear-IR image, in particular the brightest inner spiral arm. The CO emission\ntraces a rotating gas disk of size 530AU x 330AU with a deprojected maximum\nvelocity of 2.8km/s at 450AU. In contrast to the dust disk, the gas disk\nexhibits an intensity peak at the stellar position. Furthermore, the CO\nemission in several velocity channels traces the innermost spiral arm seen in\nthe near-IR. We compare the observed spatial-kinematic structure of the CO\nemission to a simple model of a disk in Keplerian rotation, and find that only\nthe emission tracing the main spiral arm clearly lies outside the confines of\nour model. This emission has a net outward radial motion compared with the\nradial velocity predicted by the model at the location of the main spiral arms.\nThe disk of AB Aur is therefore quite different from the Keplerian disks seen\naround many Herbig Ae stars. The spiral-like structures of the disk with\nnon-Keplerian motions we revealed in 12CO (3-2), together with the central\ndepression of the dust disk, may be explained to be driven by the possible\nexistence of a giant planet forming in the disk.",

In a sub-sample of 16 S--type symbiotic stars\n(with known orbital periods and well measured vsini) 15 have deviations from\nsynchronization less then the 3-sigma level. This means that we did not find\nevidence for a statistically significant deviation from the synchronization for\nany of these 15 objects. The deviation from synchronization is statistically\nsignificant (at confidence level >99%) only for the recurrent nova RS Oph.\n  For 22 S-type symbiotics we give clues as to what their orbital periods could\nbe.",

Our survey largely complements\na similar survey by Bolton et al., who recently presented several new lenses.\nThe lensed background galaxies are selected from the SDSS spectra via the\npresence of narrow emission line signatures, including the [OII] 3726,3729, Hb\nand [OIII] 4960,5008 lines, superposed on the spectra of the bright,\nintervening, deflector galaxies.

Simulations of moderately deep (few orbits) HST-ACS\nimaging of systems such as these, where the lensed source is brighter than\nr~23, are presented. These demonstrate the feasibility of measuring accurately\nthe inner slope of the dark matter halo to within an uncertainty\nsigma(gamma)~0.1, the dark matter fraction within the Einstein radius, and the\nmass-to-light ratio of the stars alone, independently of dynamical\nmeasurements. The high success rate of our search so far, >60%, and the\nrelatively modest observational resources necessary to confirm the\ngravitational lens nature of the candidates, demonstrate that compilation of a\nsample of ~100 galaxy-galaxy lenses from the SDSS is readily achievable,\nopening up a rich new field in dark matter studies.",

The second, the halo\nPN BoBn 1, has a location, distance and velocity in agreement with the leading\ntidal tail of Sgr. We estimate that 10 per cent of the Galactic halo consists\nof Sgr debris. The specific frequency of PNe indicates a total luminosity of\nSgr, including its tidal tails, of M_V=-14.1. StWr 2-21 shows a high abundance\nof [O/H]=-0.23, which confirms the high-metallicity population in Sgr uncovered\nby Bonaficio et al. (2004). The steep metallicity--age gradient in Sgr is due\nto ISM removal during the Galactic plane passages, ISM reformation due to\nstellar mass loss, and possibly accretion of metal-enriched gas from our\nGalaxy. The ISM re-formation rate of Sgr, from stellar mass loss, is 5 X 10^-4\nM_sun yr^-1, amounting to ~10^6 M_sun per orbital period. HST images reveal\nwell-developed bipolar morphologies, and provide clear detections of the\ncentral stars. All three stars with deep spectra show WR-lines, suggesting that\nthe progenitor mass and metallicity determines whether a PN central star\ndevelops a WR spectrum. One Sgr PN belongs to the class of IR-[WC] stars.\nExpansion velocities are determined for three nebulae. Comparison with\nhydrodynamical models indicates an initial density profile of rho ~ r^-3. This\nis evidence for increasing mass-loss rates on the AGB. Peak mass-loss rates are\nindicated of ~ 10^-4 M_sun yr^-1.

A classification of infrared singular configurations, based on\nsolutions of Landau equations, is introduced. Algorithms for the numerical\nevaluation of the residues of the infrared poles and of the infrared finite\nparts of diagrams are introduced and discussed within the scheme of dimensional\nregularization. Integral representations of Feynman diagrams which form a\ngeneralization of Nielsen - Goncharov polylogarithms are introduced and their\nnumerical evaluation discussed. Numerical results are shown for all different\nfamilies of multi-scale, two-loop, three-point infrared divergent diagrams and\nsuccessful comparisons with analytical results, whenever available, are\nperformed. Part of these results has already been included in a recent\nevaluation of electroweak pseudo-observables at the two-loop level.",

We want to investigate the origin of this line and its\nuse as a tracer of star formation. We present CII and OI observations of a\nsegment of a spiral arm of M~31 using the Infrared Space Observatory. The CII\nemission is compared with tracers of neutral gas (CO, HI) and star formation\n(H\\alpha, Spitzer 24 mu.) The similarity of the CII emission with the Ha and 24\nmu images is striking when smoothed to the same resolution, whereas the\ncorrelation with the neutral gas is much weaker. The CII cooling rate per H\natom increases dramatically from ~2.7e-26 ergs/s/atom in the border of the map\nto ~ 1.4e-25 ergs/s/atom in the regions of star formation. The CII/FIR(42-122)\nratio is almost constant at 2%, a factor 3 higher than typically quoted.\nHowever, we do not believe that M~31 is unusual. Rather, the whole-galaxy\nfluxes used for the comparisons include the central regions where the CII/FIR\nratio is known to be lower and the resolved observations neither isolate a\nspiral arm nor include data as far out in the galactic disk as the observations\npresented here. A fit to published PDR models yields a plausible average\nsolution of G_0~100 and n~3000 for the PDR emission in the regions of star\nformation in the arm of M31.",

These observations provide a sensitive test for models of low\nUV field photodissociation regions and offer the best constraint on the gas\ntemperature of a pre-stellar core. We find that the gas temperature of this\nobject is surprisingly low (~7-8 K), and significantly below the dust\ntemperature, in the outer layers (Av < 5 mag) that are traced by C18O and 13CO\nemission. As shown previously, the inner layers (Av > 5 mag) exhibit\nsignificant freeze-out of CO onto grain surfaces. Because the dust and gas are\nnot fully coupled, depletion of key coolants in the densest layers raises the\ncore (gas) temperature, but only by ~1 K. The gas temperature in layers not\ntraced by C18O and 13CO emission can be probed by NH3 emission, with a\npreviously estimated temperature of ~10-11 K. To reach these temperatures in\nthe inner core requires an order of magnitude reduction in the gas to dust\ncoupling rate. This potentially argues for a lack of small grains in the\ndensest gas, presumably due to grain coagulation.",

We perform a\nmulti-parameter analysis of the CMB data, including the both the WMAP first\nyear and three year data, and the ACBAR, Boomerang, CBI, and VSA data. Assuming\nthat the observed excess of $e^+e^-$ pairs in the galactic center region is\nproduced by dark matter annihilation, and that a sizable fraction of the energy\nproduced in the annihilation is deposited in the baryonic gas during\nrecombination, we obtain a %95 dark matter mass limit of $M<8 \\MeV$ with the\ncurrent data set.",

We investigate the formation of these fields by studying the\nproduction of a light quantum scalar field during the decay of a heavy\nparticle. For simplicity it is assumed to be a scalar too. We discuss the\neffects of the decay mode, the thermodynamical state of the decaying field,\nboundary conditions, and related physical parameters on the production and\nevolution of a condensate. For a simplified version of this model we calculate\nthe asymptotic behaviour of the condensate and conditions for its contribution\nto the dark energy with an equation of state close to a cosmological constant.\nWe also discus the role of the back-reaction from interactions with other\nfields and expansion of the Universe on the evolution of the condensate.",

Previous observations have shown that the near\ninfrared emission has a fan-like morphology that is consistent with emission\nfrom the northern lobe of a bipolar radio jet known to be associated with this\nsource. Mid-infrared observations presented in this paper show a monopolar\njet-like morphology as well, and it is argued that the mid-infrared emission\nobserved is dominated by thermal continuum emission from dust. The mid-infrared\nemission nearest the central stellar source is believed to be directly heated\ndust on the walls of the outflow cavity. The hydroxyl, water, and methanol\nmasers associated with G35.20-0.74 are spatially located along these\nmid-infrared cavity walls. Narrow jet or outflow cavities such as this may also\nbe the locations of the linear distribution of methanol masers that are found\nassociated with massive young stellar objects. The fact that G35.20-0.74 has\nmid-infrared emission that is dominated by the outflow, rather than disk\nemission, is a caution to those that consider mid-infrared emission from young\nstellar objects as only coming from circumstellar disks.",

The standard way to obtain information\nabout the internet topology is to use the traceroute tool from a small number\nof monitors. Recent papers have made the case that increasing the number of\nmonitors will give a more accurate view of the topology. However, scaling up\nthe number of monitors is not a trivial process. Duplication of effort close to\nthe monitors wastes time by reexploring well-known parts of the network, and\nclose to destinations might appear to be a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)\nattack as the probes converge from a set of sources towards a given\ndestination. In prior work, authors of this report proposed Doubletree, an\nalgorithm for cooperative topology discovery, that reduces the load on the\nnetwork, i.e., router IP interfaces and end-hosts, while discovering almost as\nmany nodes and links as standard approaches based on traceroute. This report\npresents our open-source and freely downloadable implementation of Doubletree\nin a tool we call traceroute@home.

We find significant absorption in the early phase of the X-ray light\ncurve, with some evidence (3 sigma level) of variability. We interpret this as\na progressive photo-ionization. We investigate the environment of the burst and\nconstrain its density profile. We find that the overall behavior of the\nafterglow is compatible with a fireball expanding in a wind environment during\nthe first 2000 seconds after the burst (observer frame). On the other hand, the\nlate (after 0.5 days, observer frame) afterglow is consistent with an\ninterstellar medium, suggesting the possible presence of a termination shock.\nWe estimate the termination shock position to be R_t ~ 1.8 x 10^{-2} pc, and\nthe wind density parameter to be A_* ~ 1.8. We try to explain the simultaneous\nflares observed in optical and X-ray bands in light of different models :\ndelayed external shock from a thick shell, inverse Compton emission from\nreverse shock, inverse Compton emission from late internal shocks or a very\nlong internal shock activity. Among these models, those based on a single\nemission mechanism, are unable to account for the broad-band observations.\nModels invoking late internal shocks, with the inclusion of IC emission, or a\nproperly tuned very long internal shock activity, offer possible explanations.",

We\nplace limits on the equivalent isotropic explosion energy in the polar regions\n(around 2.3 x 10^52 ergs), and the opening angle of the x-ray emitting ejecta\n(around 7 degrees), which give a total energy in the NE jet of order 10^50\nergs; an order of magnitude or more lower than inferred for \"typical\" GRBs.\nWhile the Cas A progenitor and explosion exhibit many of the features\nassociated with GRB hosts, e.g. extensive presupernova mass loss and rotation,\nand jets associated with the explosion, we speculate that the recoil of the\ncompact central object, with velocity 330 km/s, may have rendered the jet\nunstable. In such cases the jet rapidly becomes baryon loaded, if not truncated\naltogether.

Here, we study\nstatistical properties of interacting protein-like surfaces and predict the\neffect of universal, enhanced self-attraction of proteins. The effect\noriginates in the fact that a pattern self-match between two identical, even\nrandomly organized interacting protein surfaces is always stronger compared to\nthe pattern match between two different, promiscuous protein surfaces. This\nfinding implies an increased probability of homodimer selection in the course\nof early evolution. Our simple model of early evolutionary selection of\ninteracting proteins accurately reproduces the experimental data on homodimer\ninterface aminoacid compositions. In addition, we predict that heterodimers\nevolved from homodimers with the negative design evolutionary pressure applied\nagainst promiscuous homodimer formation. We predict that the anti-homodimer\nnegative design evolutionary signal is conveyed through the enrichment of\nheterodimeric interfaces in polar residues, and most profoundly in glutamic\nacid and lysine, which is consistent with experimental findings.

    "summary": "Two-Body Dirac equations of constraint dynamics provide a covariant framework\nto investigate the problem of highly relativistic quarks in meson bound states.\nThis formalism eliminates automatically the problems of relative time and\nenergy, leading to a covariant three dimensional formalism with the same number\nof degrees of freedom as appears in the corresponding nonrelativistic problem.\nIt provides bound state wave equations with the simplicity of the\nnonrelativistic Schroedinger equation. Here we begin important tests of the\nrelativistic sixteen component wave function solutions obtained in a recent\nwork on meson spectroscopy, extending a method developed previously for\npositronium decay into two photons. Preliminary to this we examine the\npositronium decay in the 3P_{0,2} states as well as the 1S_0. The two-gamma\nquarkonium decays that we investigate are for the \\eta_{c}, \\eta_{c}^{\\prime},\n\\chi_{c0}, \\chi_{c2}, \\pi^{0}, \\pi_{2}, a_{2}, and f_{2}^{\\prime} mesons. Our\nresults for the four charmonium states compare well with those from other quark\nmodels and show the particular importance of including all components of the\nwave function as well as strong and CM energy dependent potential effects on\nthe norm and amplitude. The results for the \\pi^{0}, although off the\nexperimental rate by 15%, is much closer than the usual expectations from a\npotential model. We conclude that the Two-Body Dirac equations lead to wave\nfunctions which provide good descriptions of the two-gamma decay amplitude and\ncan be used with some confidence for other purposes.",

The 5D features appear when the bulk mass, which\ninduces the 4D Majorana mass, is the same as the compactification scale or\nlarger than it. Depending on the type of bulk mass, the seesaw scales of the 3\ngenerations are strongly split (the tan-function case) or degenerate (the\ntanh-function case). In the split case, the seesaw enhancement is naturally\nrealized. The single right-handed neutrino dominance works in a simple setup,\nand some specific mass textures, which are just assumptions in the 4D setup,\ncan be naturally obtained in\n  5 dimensions.

Sources with flux densities above 100 mJy in the AT20G Pilot\nSurvey at declination -60 to -70 were observed at up to three epochs during\n2002-4, including near-simultaneous measurements at 5, 8 and 18 GHz in 2003. Of\nthe 173 sources detected, 65% are candidate QSOs, BL Lac objects or blazars,\n20% galaxies and 15% faint (b > 22 mag) optical objects or blank fields.\n  On a 1-2 year timescale, the general level of variability at 20 GHz appears\nto be low. For the 108 sources with good-quality measurements in both 2003 and\n2004, the median variability index at 20 GHz was 6.9% and only five sources\nvaried by more than 30% in flux density.\n  Most sources in our sample show low levels of linear polarization (typically\n1-5%), with a median fractional polarization of 2.3% at 20 GHz. There is a\ntrend for fainter sources to show higher fractional polarization.\n  At least 40% of sources selected at 20GHz have strong spectral curvature over\nthe frequency range 1-20 GHz. We use a radio `two-colour diagram' to\ncharacterize the radio spectra of our sample, and confirm that the radio-source\npopulation at 20 GHz (which is also the foreground point-source population for\nCMB anisotropy experiments like WMAP and Planck) cannot be reliably predicted\nby extrapolating the results of surveys at lower frequencies.

For primordial binaries, the time delay between formation\nand merger is expected to be short, tau~0.1 Gyr, implying that the redshift\ndistribution of merger events should follow that of star-formation. We point\nout here that for dynamically formed DNSs, the time delay between\nstar-formation and merger is dominated by the cluster core-collapse time,\nrather than by the GW inspiral time, yielding delays comparable to the Hubble\ntime. We derive the redshift distribution of merger events of dynamically\nformed DNSs, and find it to differ significantly from that typically expected\nfor primordial binaries. The observed redshift distribution of SHBs favors\ndynamical formation, although a primordial origin cannot be ruled out due to\npossible detection biases. Future red-shift observations of SHBs may allow to\ndetermine whether they are dominated by primordial or dynamically formed DNSs.",

For this model we identify situations for which a linear\ncombination of the axionic parts of the two Kahler moduli acts as an inflaton.\nAs in our previous scenario, inflation begins at a saddle point of the scalar\npotential and proceeds as an eternal topological inflation. For a certain range\nof inflationary parameters, we obtain the COBE-normalized spectrum of metric\nperturbations and an inflationary scale of M = 3 x 10^{14} GeV. We discuss\npossible changes of parameters of our model and argue that anthropic\nconsiderations favor those parameters that lead to a nearly flat spectrum of\ninflationary perturbations, which in our case is characterized by the spectral\nindex n_s = 0.95.",

In three isothermal simulations with M_J=1 solar mass,\nM_J=2 solar masses and M_J=5 solar masses, the number of stars formed, at\ncomparable dynamical times, scales roughly with the number of initial Jeans\nmasses in the cloud. The mean stellar mass also increases (though less than\nlinearly) with the initial Jeans mass in the cloud. It is found that the IMF in\neach case displays a prominent knee, located roughly at the mass scale of the\ninitial Jeans mass. Thus clouds with higher initial Jeans masses produce IMFs\nwhich are shallow to higher masses. This implies that a universal IMF requires\na physical mechanism that sets the Jeans mass to be near 1 solar mass.\nSimulations including a barotropic equation of state as suggested by Larson,\nwith cooling at low densities followed by gentle heating at higher densities,\nare able to produce realistic IMFs with the knee located at approximately 1\nsolar mass, even with an initial M_J=5 solar masses. We therefore suggest that\nthe observed universality of the IMF in the local Universe does not require any\nfine tuning of the initial conditions in star forming clouds but is instead\nimprinted by details of the cooling physics of the collapsing gas.",

The nature of the BPS strings in this benchmark\ntheory crucially depends on N_f. If N_f\\geq N and all quark masses are equal,\nit supports non-Abelian BPS strings which have internal (orientational) moduli.\nIf N_f>N these strings become semilocal, developing additional moduli \\rho\nrelated to (unlimited) variations of their transverse size.\n  Using the U(2) gauge group with N_f=3,4 as an example, we derive an effective\nlow-energy theory on the (two-dimensional) string world sheet. Our derivation\nis field-theoretic, direct and explicit: we first analyze the Bogomol'nyi\nequations for string-geometry solitons, suggest an ansatz and solve it at large\n\\rho. Then we use this solution to obtain the world-sheet theory.\n  In the semiclassical limit our result confirms the Hanany-Tong conjecture,\nwhich rests on brane-based arguments, that the world-sheet theory is N=2\nsupersymmetric U(1) gauge theory with N positively and N_e=N_f-N negatively\ncharged matter multiplets and the Fayet-Iliopoulos term determined by the\nfour-dimensional coupling constant. We conclude that the Higgs branch of this\nmodel is not lifted by quantum effects. As a result, such strings cannot\nconfine.\n  Our analysis of infrared effects, not seen in the Hanany-Tong consideration,\nshows that, in fact, the derivative expansion can make sense only provided the\ntheory under consideration is regularized in the infrared, e.g. by the quark\nmass differences.

Higher-mass stars and the\nSalpeter-like slope of the IMF are most likely formed through continued\naccretion in a clustered environment.

    "summary": "Universal compression of patterns of sequences generated by independently\nidentically distributed (i.i.d.) sources with unknown, possibly large,\nalphabets is investigated. A pattern is a sequence of indices that contains all\nconsecutive indices in increasing order of first occurrence. If the alphabet of\na source that generated a sequence is unknown, the inevitable cost of coding\nthe unknown alphabet symbols can be exploited to create the pattern of the\nsequence. This pattern can in turn be compressed by itself. It is shown that if\nthe alphabet size $k$ is essentially small, then the average minimax and\nmaximin redundancies as well as the redundancy of every code for almost every\nsource, when compressing a pattern, consist of at least 0.5 log(n/k^3) bits per\neach unknown probability parameter, and if all alphabet letters are likely to\noccur, there exist codes whose redundancy is at most 0.5 log(n/k^2) bits per\neach unknown probability parameter, where n is the length of the data\nsequences. Otherwise, if the alphabet is large, these redundancies are\nessentially at least O(n^{-2/3}) bits per symbol, and there exist codes that\nachieve redundancy of essentially O(n^{-1/2}) bits per symbol. Two sub-optimal\nlow-complexity sequential algorithms for compression of patterns are presented\nand their description lengths analyzed, also pointing out that the pattern\naverage universal description length can decrease below the underlying i.i.d.\\\nentropy for large enough alphabets.",

Pseudobulges are\n``bulges'' which form through secular evolution, rather than mergers. In this\nstudy, pseudobulges are identified using the presence of disk-like structure in\nthe center of the galaxy (nuclear spiral, nuclear bar, and/or high ellipticity\nin bulge); classical bulges are those galaxy bulges with smooth isophotes which\nare round compared to the outer disk, and show no disky structure in their\nbulge. I show that galaxies structurally identified as having pseudobulges have\nhigher central star formation rates than those of classical bulges. Further, I\nalso show that galaxies identified as having classical bulges have remarkably\nregular star formation profiles. The color profiles of galaxies with classical\nbulges show a star forming outer disk with a sharp change, consistent with a\ndecline in star formation rates, toward the center of the galaxy. Classical\nbulges have a nearly constant inner profile (r < 1.5 kpc) that is similar to\nelliptical galaxies. Pseudobulges in general show no such transition in star\nformation properties from the outer disk to the central pseudobulge. Thus I\nconclude that pseudobulges and classical bulges do in fact form their stars via\ndifferent mechanisms. Further, this adds to the evidence that classical bulges\nform most of their stars in fast episodic bursts, in a similar fashion to\nelliptical galaxies; whereas, pseudobulges form stars from longer lasting\nsecular processes.",

The magnetic fluxes in\nresistive MHD model are extracted from the first core during 10^12 cm^-3 < n <\n10^16 cm^-3 by Ohmic dissipation. Magnetic flux density of the formed stellar\ncore (n \\simeq 10^20 cm^-3) in resistive MHD model is two orders of magnitude\nsmaller than that in ideal MHD model. Since magnetic braking is less effective\nin resistive MHD model, rapidly rotating stellar core (the second core) is\nformed.

Based on the single-star photometry, we separate different stellar\npopulations and analyze their spatial distribution. Results. On archival images\nobtained with the Hubble Space Telescope ACS/WFC the surroundings of these\ngalaxies are well resolved into stars with the red giant population (RGB)\nidentified far above the galaxy mid-planes. We find that there are a profound\nchange in slope of the number density profile of the evolved RGB stars at\nextraplanar height of 4-8 kpc, that possibly reflects a truncation of the thick\ndisk and reaching the 2-3 times more extended oblate stellar component (``the\nhalo'').

It has\nbeen a mystery ever since it was first detected by the OAO-2 space telescope\n(Code & Welch 1979) because such old metal-rich populations were not expected\nto contain any substantial number of hot stars. It was confirmed by following\nspace missions, ANS (de Boer 1982), IUE (Bertola et al. 1982) and HUT (Brown et\nal. 1997). The positive correlation between the UV-to-optical colour (i.e., the\nstrength of the UV upturn) and the Mg2 line strength found by Burstein et al.\n(1987) through IUE observations has urged theorists to construct novel\nscenarios in which metal-rich ($\\gtrsim Z_{\\odot}$) old ($\\gtrsim$ a few Gyr)\nstars become UV bright (Greggio & Renzini 1990; Horch et al. 1992). Also\ninteresting was to find using HUT that, regardless of the UV strength, the UV\nspectral slopes at 1000--2000\\AA in the six UV bright galaxies were nearly\nidentical suggesting a very small range of temperatures of the UV sources in\nthese galaxies (Brown et al. 1997), which corresponds to $T_{\\rm eff} \\approx\n20,000 \\pm 3,000$ K. This, together with other evidence, effectively ruled out\nyoung stars as the main driver of the UV upturn.

We divided the time series of the Nikkei 225 index\ninto two periods, an inflationary period and a deflationary period. We have\npreviously [18] found that the distribution of absolute log-returns can be\napproximated by the power-law distribution in the inflationary period, while\nthe distribution of absolute log-returns is well described by the exponential\ndistribution in the deflationary period.\\par To further explore these empirical\nfindings, we have introduced a model of stock markets which was proposed in\n[19,20]. In this model, the stock market is composed of two groups of traders:\n{\\it the fundamentalists}, who believe that the asset price will return to the\nfundamental price, and {\\it the interacting traders}, who can be noise traders.\nWe show through numerical simulation of the model that when the number of\ninteracting traders is greater than the number of fundamentalists, the\npower-law distribution of absolute log-returns is generated by the interacting\ntraders' herd behavior, and, inversely, when the number of fundamentalists is\ngreater than the number of interacting traders, the exponential distribution of\nabsolute log-returns is generated.",

We characterize the broad\nH$\\beta$ emission-line profiles by the ratio of their full-width at half\nmaximum (FWHM) to their line dispersion, i.e., the second moment of the line\nprofile. We use this parameter to separate the reverberation-mapped AGNs into\ntwo populations, the first with narrower H$\\beta$ lines with relatively\nextended wings, and the second with broader lines that are relatively\nflat-topped. The first population is characterized by higher Eddington ratios\nthan the second. Within each population, we calibrate the black-hole mass scale\nby comparison of the reverberation-based mass with that predicted by the bulge\nvelocity dispersion. We also use the distribution of ratios of the\nreverberation-based mass to the velocity-dispersion mass prediction in a\ncomparison with a ``generalized thick disk'' model in order to see if\ninclination can plausibly account for the observed distribution. We find that\nthe line dispersion is a less biased parameter in general than FWHM for black\nhole mass estimation, although we show that it is possible to empirically\ncorrect for the bias introduced by using FWHM to characterize the emission-line\nwidth. We also argue that inclination effects are apparent in a small subset of\nobjects with the narrowest emission lines. Our principal conclusion is that the\nH$\\beta$ profile is sensitive primarily to Eddington ratio, but that\ninclination effects play a role in some cases. (abridged)",

The two\nrecognised regimes (non-resonant and resonant) of the streaming instability are\ntaken into account. We show that the non-resonant instability is very efficient\nand saturates through a balance between its growth and non-linear transfer. The\ncosmic-ray resonant instability then takes over and is quenched by advection\nthrough the shock. The level of turbulence is determined by the non-resonant\nregime if the shock velocity $V_{\\rm sh}$ is larger than a few times $\\xi_{\\rm\nCR} c$, where $\\xi_{\\rm CR}$ is the ratio of the cosmic-ray pressure to the\nshock kinetic energy. The instability determines the dependence of the spectrum\nwith respect to $k_\\parallel$ (wavenumbers along the shock normal). The\ntransverse cascade of Alfv\\'en waves simultaneously determines the dependence\nin $k_{\\perp}$. We also study the redistribution of turbulent energy between\nforward and backward waves, which occurs through the interaction of two\nAlfv\\'en and one slow magneto-sonic wave.

This theory is also generalized to $\\mathcal{O}_X$-modules\n$\\mathcal{M}$, $X$ a $k$- scheme. In these notes we consider the definition of\ngeneralized Massey products and the relation algebra in any obstruction\nsituation (a differential graded $k$-algebra with certain properties), and\nprove that this theory applies to the case of graded $R$-modules, $R$ a graded\n$k$-algebra, $k$ algebraically closed. When the relation algebra is\nalgebraizable, that is the relations are polynomials rather than power series,\nthis gives a combinatorial way to compute open (\\'{e}tale) subsets of the\nmoduli of graded $R$-modules. This also gives a sufficient condition for the\ncorresponding point in the moduli of $\\mathcal{O}_{\\Proj(R)}$-modules to be\nsingular.

TMT is an alternative gravity and matter field\ntheory where the gravitational interaction of fermionic matter is reduced to\nthat of General Relativity when the energy density of the fermion matter is\nmuch larger than the dark energy density. In this case also the 5-th force\nproblem is solved automatically. In the opposite limit, where the magnitudes of\nfermionic energy density and scalar field dark energy density become\ncomparable, nonrelativistic fermions can participate in the cosmological\nexpansion in a very unusual manner. Some of the features of such states in a\ntoy model of the late time universe filled with homogeneous scalar field and\nuniformly distributed nonrelativistic neutrinos: neutrino mass increases as m ~\na^{3/2}; the neutrino gas equation-of-state approaches w=-1, i.e. neutrinos\nbehave as a sort of dark energy; the total (scalar field + neutrino)\nequation-of-state also approaches w=-1; the total energy density of such\nuniverse is less than it would be in the universe filled with the scalar field\nalone. An analytic solution is presented. A domain structure of the dark energy\nseems to be possible. We speculate that decays of the CLEP state neutrinos may\nbe both an origin of cosmic rays and responsible for a late super-acceleration\nof the universe. In this sense the CLEP states exhibit simultaneously new\nphysics at very low densities and for very high particle masses.",

This field of\nresearch experienced a revival in the eighties and nineties by a number of high\nresolution observations at low and high frequencies, which showed a large\nvariety of polarization structures having no corresponding signature in the\ntotal intensity images. 'Canals' and 'Faraday screens' were reported, which\nclearly indicate that Faraday rotation in the magneto-ionic medium may largely\nvary on small scales. These findings called for a systematic approach and a\nnumber of new unbiased polarization surveys were started. Also new attempts for\nabsolute calibration are under way, which is a critical issue when interpreting\npolarization structures.

Up to now it was considered\nonly the influence of the galactic and the extragalactic magnetic fields. In\nthis article we focus our analysis on the influence of the magnetic field of\nthe galaxies standing between possible UHECR sources and us. Our main approach\nis to start from the well known galaxy distribution up to 120 Mpc. We use the\nmost complete galaxy catalog: the LEDA catalog. Inside a sphere of 120 Mpc\naround us, we extract 60130 galaxies with known position. In our simulations we\nassign a Halo Dipole magnetic Field (HDF) to each galaxy. The code developed is\nable to retro-propagate a charged particle from the arrival points of UHECR\ndata across our galaxies sample. We present simulations in case of Virgo\ncluster and show that there is a non negligible deviation in the case of\nprotons of $7 \\times 10^{19}$ eV, even if the $B$ value is conservative. Then\nspecial attention is devoted to the AGASA triplet where we find that NGC3998\nand NGC3992 could be possible candidates as sources.",

With upcoming high-statistics scattering\nexperiments such as MINER$\\nu$A and FINeSSE, a scrutiny of the PW relation is\ntimely. Employing a relativistic Glauber nucleon knockout model for the\ndescription of quasielastic neutrino-nucleus reactions, the influence of\nnuclear effects on the PW relation is investigated. We discuss nuclear-model\ndependences and show that the PW relation is a robust ratio, mitigating the\neffect of final-state interactions, for example to the 1% level. The role\nplayed by a possible strangeness content of the nucleon is investigated. It\nappears that the uncertainties arising from the poorly known strangeness\nparameters and the difficulties in nuclear modelling seriously limit the\napplicability of the PW relation as an intermediate-energy electroweak\nprecision tool. On the other hand, we show that nuclear effects may be\nsufficiently well under control to allow the extraction of new information on\nthe axial strangeness parameter.

More specifically, the paper focuses on the\nestimation of model parameters for a class of generalized Gibbs random fields,\ni.e., Spartan Spatial Random Fields (SSRFs). The problem of parameter inference\nis based on the minimization of a distance metric. The latter involves a\nspecifically designed distance between sample constraints (variance,\ngeneralized ``gradient'' and ``curvature'') and their ensemble counterparts.\nThe general principles used in the construction of the metric are discussed and\nintuitively motivated. In order to enable calculation of the metric from sample\ndata, estimators for generalized ``gradient'' and ``curvature'' constraints are\nconstructed. These estimators, which are not restricted to SSRFs, are\nformulated using compactly supported kernel functions. An intuitive method for\nkernel bandwidth selection is proposed. It is proved that the estimators are\nasymptotically unbiased and consistent for differentiable random fields, under\nspecified regularity conditions. For continuous but non-differentiable random\nfields, it is shown that the estimators are asymptotically consistent. The bias\nis calculated explicitly for different kernel functions. The performance of the\nsample constraint estimators and the SSRF inference process are investigated by\nmeans of numerical simulations.",

They suggest that this emission\narises from a merging system composed of a Ly-break galaxy and a pair of\nextremely red objects which are multiply-imaged in the optical/NIR\nobservations. Since the submm emission presents an unusually large angular\nextent (~1 arcmin), the possible radio emission asociatted with that system can\nhelp to identify optical/NIR counterparts due to the higher spatial resolution\nand astrometric accuracy of the radio observations. Archive VLA data (BnA\nconfiguration at 1.4 GHz) was reduced and analysed. A simple lens model was\nconstructed to aid the interpretation of the radio and pre-existing sub-mm and\noptical/NIR data. We present a 1.4 GHz map of the central region of\nMS0451.6-0305 and report the detection of gravitationally lensed radio\nemission, coincident with the previously discovered sub-mm lensed emission. The\noverall morphology and scale of the radio and sub-mm emission are strikingly\nsimilar, extending ~1 arcmin across the sky. This observation strongly suggests\nthat the radio and sub-mm emission arise from the same sources. Preliminary\nestimates of the total S_850 microns/S_1.4 GHz flux density ratio appear to be\nconsistent with that expected from distant star forming galaxies. The radio\nemission is resolved into 7 distinct components, and the overall structure can\nbe explained, using a simple lens model, with three multiply-imaged radio\nsources at z~2.9. One of these sources is predicted to lie in the middle of the\npreviously mentioned system in the source plane, suggesting that it is related\nto the intense star formation generated during the merging process.",

    "summary": "We are developing a framework for multiscale computation which enables models\nat a ``microscopic'' level of description, for example Lattice Boltzmann, Monte\nCarlo or Molecular Dynamics simulators, to perform modelling tasks at\n``macroscopic'' length scales of interest. The plan is to use the microscopic\nrules restricted to small \"patches\" of the domain, the \"teeth'', using\ninterpolation to bridge the \"gaps\". Here we explore general boundary conditions\ncoupling the widely separated ``teeth'' of the microscopic simulation that\nachieve high order accuracy over the macroscale. We present the simplest case\nwhen the microscopic simulator is the quintessential example of a partial\ndifferential equation. We argue that classic high-order interpolation of the\nmacroscopic field provides the correct forcing in whatever boundary condition\nis required by the microsimulator. Such interpolation leads to Tooth Boundary\nConditions which achieve arbitrarily high-order consistency. The high-order\nconsistency is demonstrated on a class of linear partial differential equations\nin two ways: firstly through the eigenvalues of the scheme for selected\nnumerical problems; and secondly using the dynamical systems approach of\nholistic discretisation on a general class of linear \\textsc{pde}s. Analytic\nmodelling shows that, for a wide class of microscopic systems, the subgrid\nfields and the effective macroscopic model are largely independent of the tooth\nsize and the particular tooth boundary conditions. When applied to patches of\nmicroscopic simulations these tooth boundary conditions promise efficient\nmacroscale simulation. We expect the same approach will also accurately couple\npatch simulations in higher spatial dimensions.",

In particular we discuss them in the context of the current\ndebate surrounding the formation and evolution of cores. There exist several\nfamilies of model scenarios to explain this evolution (with many variations of\neach) that can be thought of as a continuum of models lying between two extreme\nparadigms for the star and core formation process. At one extreme there is the\ndynamic, turbulent picture, while at the other extreme there is a slow,\nquasi-static vision of core evolution. In the latter view the magnetic field\nplays a dominant role, and it may also play some role in the former picture.\nPolarization and Zeeman measurements indicate that some, if not all, cores\ncontain a significant magnetic field. Wide-field surveys constrain the\ntimescales of the core formation and evolution processes, as well as the\nstatistical distribution of core masses. The former indicates that prestellar\ncores typically live for 2--5 free-fall times, while the latter seems to\ndetermine the stellar initial mass function. In addition, multiple surveys\nallow one to compare core properties in different regions. From this it appears\nthat aspects of different models may be relevant to different star-forming\nregions, depending on the environment. Prestellar cores in cluster-forming\nregions are smaller in radius and have higher column densities, by up to an\norder of magnitude, than isolated prestellar cores. This is probably due to the\nfact that in cluster-forming regions the prestellar cores are formed by\nfragmentation of larger, more turbulent cluster-forming cores, which in turn\nform as a result of strong external compression.",

The gravitational wave power spectra show common features: they\nare both blue on large scales, and peak at the correlation scale. However, the\nmagnetic field can be treated as a coherent source and it is active for a long\ntime. This results in a very effective conversion of magnetic energy in\ngravitational wave energy at horizon crossing. Turbulence instead acts as a\nsource for gravitational waves over a time interval much shorter than a Hubble\ntime, and the conversion into gravitational wave energy is much less effective.\nWe also derive a strong constraint on the amplitude of a primordial magnetic\nfield when the correlation length is much smaller than the horizon.",

    "summary": "New arguments are presented in favor of the infrared finite coupling approach\nto power corrections in the context of Sudakov resummation. The more regular\ninfrared behavior of some peculiar combinations of Sudakov anomalous\ndimensions, free of Landau singularities at large Nf, is pointed out. A general\nconflict between the infrared finite coupling and infrared renormalon\napproaches to power corrections is explained, and a possible resolution is\nproposed, which makes use of the arbitrariness of the choice of constant terms\nin the Sudakov exponent. A simple ansatz for a `universal' non-perturbative\nSudakov effective coupling at large Nf emerges naturally from these\nconsiderations. An alternative evidence for an infrared finite {\\em\nperturbative} effective coupling in the Drell-Yan process at large Nf (albeit\nat odds with the infrared renormalon argument) is found within the framework of\nSudakov resummation for eikonal cross sections of Laenen, Sterman and\nVogelsang.",

This paper uses rf pulse to implement\nHadamard operation (rotation) and stimulated Raman transition technique as\nunitary shift operator. The scheme suggests implementation of Hadamard\noperation and unitary shift operator while the BEC is trapped in long Rayleigh\nrange optical dipole trap. The Hadamard rotation and a unitary shift operator\non BEC prepared in one of the internal state followed by a bit flip operation,\nimplements one step of the Hadamard walk. To realize a sizable number of steps,\nthe process is iterated without resorting to intermediate measurement. With\ncurrent dipole trap technology it should be possible to implement enough steps\nto experimentally highlight the discrete quantum random walk using a BEC\nleading to further exploration of quantum random walks and its applications.",

The flux was found to vary\nbetween 0.5 -- 2 Crab units (integrated above 200 GeV), considered a low state\nwhen compared to known data. Although the flux varied on a day-by-day basis, no\nshort-term variability was observed, although there is some indication that not\nall nights are in an equally quiescent state. The results at higher energies\nwere found to be consistent with previous observations. A clear correlation is\nobserved between gamma-rays and X-rays fluxes, whereas no significant\ncorrelation between gamma-rays and optical data is seen. The spectral energy\ndistribution between 100 GeV and 3 TeV shows a clear deviation from a power\nlaw, more clearly and at lower flux than previous observations at higher\nenergies. The deviation persists after correcting for the effect of attenuation\nby the extragalactic background light, and most likely is source-inherent.\nThere is a rather clear indication of an inverse Compton peak around 100 GeV.\nThe spectral energy distribution of Mkn 421 can be fitted by a one-zone\nsynchrotron self-compton model suggesting once again a leptonic origin of the\nvery high energy gamma-ray emission from this blazar.",

Thermodynamic\ndomains, which are either Open, Closed, Isolated, or in Equilibrium, can be put\ninto correspondence with topological systems of Pfaff topological dimension 4,\n3, 2 and 1. If the environment of the universe is assumed to be a physical\nvacuum of Pfaff topological dimension 4, then continuous but irreversible\ntopological evolution can cause the emergence of topologically coherent defect\nstructures of Pfaff topological dimension less than 4. As galaxies and stars\nexchange radiation but not matter with the environment, they are emergent\ntopological defects of Pfaff topological dimension 3 which are far from\nequilibrium. DeRham topological theory of period integrals over closed but not\nexact exterior differential systems leads to the emergence of quantized,\ndeformable, but topologically coherent, singular macrostates at all scales.

WMAP observes\nsignificant levels of polarized foreground emission due to both Galactic\nsynchrotron radiation and thermal dust emission. The least contaminated channel\nis at 61 GHz. Informed by a model of the Galactic foreground emission, we\nsubtract the foreground emission from the maps. In the foreground corrected\nmaps, for l=2-6, we detect l(l+1) C_l^{EE} / (2 pi) = 0.086 +-0.029\nmicrokelvin^2. This is interpreted as the result of rescattering of the CMB by\nfree electrons released during reionization and corresponds to an optical depth\nof tau = 0.10 +- 0.03. We see no evidence for B-modes, limiting them to l(l+1)\nC_l^{BB} / (2 pi) = -0.04 +- 0.03 microkelvin^2. We find that the limit from\nthe polarization signals alone is r<2.2 (95% CL) corresponding to a limit on\nthe cosmic density of gravitational waves of Omega_{GW}h^2 < 5 times 10^{-12}.\n  From the full WMAP analysis, we find r<0.55 (95% CL) corresponding to a limit\nof Omega_{GW}h^2 < 10^{-12} (95% CL).",

    "summary": "We present new full-sky temperature maps in five frequency bands from 23 to\n94 GHz, based on the first three years of the WMAP sky survey. The new maps,\nwhich are consistent with the first-year maps and more sensitive, incorporate\nimprovements in data processing made possible by the additional years of data\nand by a more complete analysis of the polarization signal. These include\nrefinements in the gain calibration and beam response models. We employ two\nforms of multi-frequency analysis to separate astrophysical foreground signals\nfrom the CMB, each of which improves on our first-year analyses. First, we form\nan improved 'Internal Linear Combination' map, based solely on WMAP data, by\nadding a bias correction step and by quantifying residual uncertainties in the\nresulting map. Second, we fit and subtract new spatial templates that trace\nGalactic emission; in particular, we now use low-frequency WMAP data to trace\nsynchrotron emission. The WMAP point source catalog is updated to include 115\nnew sources. We derive the angular power spectrum of the temperature anisotropy\nusing a hybrid approach that combines a maximum likelihood estimate at low l\n(large angular scales) with a quadratic cross-power estimate for l>30. Our best\nestimate of the CMB power spectrum is derived by averaging cross-power spectra\nfrom 153 statistically independent channel pairs. The combined spectrum is\ncosmic variance limited to l=400, and the signal-to-noise ratio per l-mode\nexceeds unity up to l=850. The first two acoustic peaks are seen at l=220.8 +-\n0.7 and l=530.9 +- 3.8, respectively, while the first two troughs are seen at\nl=412.4 +- 1.9 and l=675.1 +- 11.1, respectively. The rise to the third peak is\nunambiguous; when the WMAP data are combined with higher resolution CMB\nmeasurements, the existence of a third acoustic peak is well established.",

In a\nprevious paper we developed the formalism for low-order energies and excitation\nfrequencies. This formalism has been applied to atoms, Bose-Einstein\ncondensates and quantum dots. One major advantage of the method is that N\nappears as a parameter in the analytical expressions for the energy and so\nresults for N up to a few thousand are easy to obtain. Other properties\nhowever, are also of interest, for example the density profile in the case of a\nBEC,and larger N results are desirable as well.

    "summary": "SDSSJ1049+5103, commonly known as Willman 1, is an extremely low-luminosity\nMilky Way companion whose properties are intermediate between those of globular\nclusters and dwarf spheroidals. In this paper, we use deep photometry to show\nthat this object is old and moderately metal-poor, has a distance of 38 +/- 7\nkpc, has an M_V of -2.5 mag, and has a half-light radius of 21 +/- 7 pc,\nconsistent with previous estimates. The spatial distribution of Willman 1's\nmain sequence stars shows 1) its total spatial extent exceeds its tidal radius\nfor a range of assumptions about its total mass and its orbit and 2) the\npresence of prominent multi-directional stellar tails. The tidal interactions\ncausing these tail features may explain the large physical size of Willman 1\nrelative to low-luminosity globular clusters. It is the most distant Galactic\nobject yet known to display prominent tails, and is the only distant satellite\nto display multi-directional tails. Although we cannot at present determine the\ncause of this unusual morphology, preliminary comparisons between the\nmorphology of Willman 1 and published simulations suggest that it may be near\nthe apocenter of its orbit, or that it may have interacted with another halo\nobject. We find a significant difference between the luminosity functions of\nstars in the center and in the tails of Willman 1, strongly suggesting mass\nsegregation much like that seen in Palomar 5. Although Willman 1 has more\npronounced tidal tails than most confirmed Milky Way dwarf galaxies, because of\nits very low stellar mass we cannot at present rule out the possibility that it\nhas a dark matter halo.

    "summary": "We study the growth of galactic disks in live triaxial DM halos. The halos\nhave been assembled through constrained realizations method and evolved from\nthe linear regime using cosmological simulations. The `seed' disks have been\ninserted at redshift z=3 and increased in mass tenfold over various time\nperiods, ~1-3 Gyr, with the halo responding quasi-adiabatically to this\nprocess. We follow the dynamical and secular evolution of the disk-halo system\nand analyze changes in the most important parameters, like 3-D DM shapes,\nstellar and DM radial density profiles, stellar bar development, etc. We find\nthat a growing disk is responsible for washing out the halo prolateness and for\ndiluting its flatness over a period of time comparable to the disk growth.\nMoreover, we find that a disk which contributes more to the overall rotation\ncurve in the system is also more efficient in axisymmetrizing the halo, without\naccelerating the halo figure rotation. The observational corollary is that the\nmaximal disks probably reside in nearly axisymmetric halos, while disks whose\nrotation is dominated by the halo at all radii are expected to reside in more\nprolate halos. The halo shape is sensitive to the final disk mass, but is\nindependent of how the seed disk is introduced into the system. We also expect\nthat the massive disks are subject to a bar instability, while light disks have\nthis instability damped by the halo triaxiality. Implications to the\ncosmological evolution of disks embedded in asymmetric halos are discussed and\nso are the corollaries for the observed fraction of stellar bars. Finally, the\nhalo responds to the stellar bar by developing a gravitational wake -- a\n`ghost' bar of its own which is almost in-phase with that in the disk.",

Aperture corrections and the absolute calibration have been checked\nusing stars in the field. Astrometric and photometric errors depend on the SNR\nof the source varying between 0.35-1 arcsec and 5-15%, respectively, for\nsources detected at 20-5 sigma. The flux of the 123 extended sources have been\nestimated through aperture photometry. The extended sources cover less than\n0.3% of the total area of the survey. Based on simulations, the main and\nverification surveys are 50% complete at 0.3 and 0.15 mJy, respectively.\nCounterparts have been searched for in optical and radio catalogs.

It employs two (or\nmore) specially designed aspheric mirrors to create a high-contrast amplitude\nprofile across the telescope pupil that does not appreciably attenuate\namplitude. As such, it reaps significant benefits in light collecting\nefficiency and inner working angle, both critical parameters for terrestrial\nplanet detection. While much has been published on various aspects of pupil\nmapping systems, the problem of sensitivity to wavefront aberrations remains an\nopen question. In this paper, we present an efficient method for computing the\nsensitivity of a pupil mapped system to Zernike aberrations. We then use this\nmethod to study the sensitivity of a particular pupil mapping system and\ncompare it to the concentric-ring shaped pupil coronagraph. In particular, we\nshow how contrast and inner working angle degrade with increasing Zernike order\nand rms amplitude, which has obvious ramifications for the stability\nrequirements and overall design of a planet-finding observatory.",

The reason is trivial: after\nillegitimate replacement $\\hat{n}^{2}=\\hat{n}n_{0},$ where \\hat{n} is the\nelectron number operator, n_{0} the average molecular level occupation,\nGalperin et al. obtained non-physical dependence of a renormalized molecular\nenergy level on the non-integer mean occupation number n_{0} (i.e. the electron\nself-interaction) and the resulting non-linearity of current. The exact theory\nof correlated polaronic transport through molecular quantum dots (MQDs) that we\nproposed earlier [Phys. Rev. B67, 235312 (2003)] proved that there is no\nhysteresis or switching in current-voltage characteristics of non-degenerate,\nd=1, or double degenerate, d=2, molecular bridges, contrary to the mean-field\nresult. Switching could only appear in multiply degenerate MQDs with d>2 due to\nelectron correlations.

To study the impact of CRs on galaxy\nand cosmic structure formation and evolution, we develop an approximative\nframework for treating dynamical and radiative effects of CRs in cosmological\nsimulations. Our guiding principle is to try to find a balance between\ncapturing as many physical properties of CR populations as possible while at\nthe same time requiring as little extra computational resources as possible. We\napproximate the CR spectrum of each fluid element by a single power-law, with\nspatially and temporally varying normalisation, low-energy cut-off, and\nspectral index. Principles of conservation of particle number, energy, and\npressure are then used to derive evolution equations for the basic variables\ndescribing the CR spectrum, both due to adiabatic and non-adiabatic processes.\nThe processes considered include compression and rarefaction, CR injection via\nshocks in supernova remnants, injection in structure formation shock waves,\nin-situ re-acceleration of CRs, CR spatial diffusion, CR energy losses due to\nCoulomb interactions, ionisation losses, Bremsstrahlung losses, and, finally,\nhadronic interactions with the background gas, including the associated\ngamma-ray and radio emission due to subsequent pion decay. We show that the\nformalism reproduces CR energy densities, pressure, and cooling rates with an\naccuracy of ~10% in steady state conditions where CR injection balances\ncooling. Our framework is therefore well suited to be included into numerical\nsimulation schemes of galaxy and structure formation. (abridged)",

A scattering matrix formalism is\ndeveloped to address both coherent and incoherent transport properties. The\ncoherent case corresponds to elastic scattering by static defects, which is\ndominant at low temperatures, while the incoherent case provides a\nphenomenological description of the inelastic scattering present in real\nphysical systems at room temperature. It is found that disorder scattering\nincreases the amount of spin-mixing of transmitted electrons, reducing the\nadiabaticity. This leads, in the incoherent case, to a reduction of conductance\nthrough the domain wall as compared to a uniformly magnetized region which is\nsimilar to the giant magnetoresistance effect. In the coherent case, a\nreduction of weak localization, together with a suppression of spin-reversing\nscattering amplitudes, leads to an enhancement of conductance due to the domain\nwall in the regime of strong disorder. The total effect of a domain wall on the\nconductance of a nanowire is studied by incorporating the disordered regions on\neither side of the wall. It is found that spin-dependent scattering in these\nregions increases the domain wall magnetoconductance as compared to the effect\nfound by considering only the scattering inside the wall. This increase is most\ndramatic in the narrow wall limit, but remains significant for wide walls.",

    "summary": "In addition to lines originating in a soft phase at ~0.8 keV and to cold\nmolecular clouds, the X-ray spectra from the Galactic center region also\nexhibit properties similar to those of a diffuse, thin, very hot plasma at 8\nkeV on a scale of hundreds of parsecs. This phase is surprising for more than\none reason. First, such a hot plasma should not be bound to the Galactic plane\nand the power needed to sustain the escaping matter would be higher then any\nknown source. Second, there is no known mechanism able to heat the plasma to\nmore than a few keV. Recently we have suggested that, hydrogen having escaped,\nthe hot plasma could be a helium plasma, heavy enough to be gravitationally\nconfined. In this case, the required power is much more reasonable. We present\nhere a possible heating mechanism which taps the gravitational energy of the\nmolecular clouds. We note that the 8 keV plasma is highly viscous and we show\nhow viscous friction of molecular clouds flowing within the hot phase can\ndissipate energy in the gas and heat it. We detail the MHD wake of a spherical\ncloud by considering the different MHD waves the cloud can excite. We find that\nmost of the energy is dissipated by the damping of Alfvenic perturbations in\ntwo possible manners, namely by non-linear effects and by a large scale\ncurvature of the field lines. Depending on the field strength, this heating can\nbalance the radiative cooling. We note that the plasma parameters may be\noptimal to make the dissipation most efficient, suggesting a self-regulation\nmechanism. The loss of kinetic and gravitational energy also causes accretion\nof the clouds and may have significant action on the gas dynamics in this\nregion between the large scale, bar dominated flow and the central accretion to\nthe massive black hole.",

The feedback algorithm is shown to achieve the\ncarrier phase coherence required for beamforming in a scalable and distributed\nmanner.

In order to determine the\nrelevant quasi-equilibrium configuration at time t from given initial\nconditions, it is often argued that such slow evolution may be approximated in\nterms of adiabatic evolution, for the calculation of which efficient\nsemi--analytical techniques are available. Here we focus on the slow process of\nevolution, induced by dynamical friction of a host stellar system on a minority\ncomponent of \"satellites\", that we have investigated in a previous paper, to\ndetermine to what extent an adiabatic description might be applied. The study\nis realized by comparing directly N--body simulations of the stellar system\nevolution (in two significantly different models) from initial to final\nconditions in a controlled numerical environment. We demonstrate that for the\nexamined process the adiabatic description is going to provide incorrect\nanswers, not only quantitatively, but also qualitatively. The two classes of\nmodels considered exhibit generally similar trends in evolution, with one\nexception noted in relation to the evolution of the total density profile. This\nsimple conclusion should be taken as a warning against the indiscriminate use\nof adiabatic growth prescriptions in studies of structure of galaxies.",

A\ncomparison of the colour and period relations with those of similar stars in\nthe Large Magellanic Cloud indicates minor differences, which may be the\nconsequence of sample selection effects. Apparent bolometric magnitudes were\ndetermined by combining the mean JHKL fluxes with mid-infrared photometry from\nIRAS and MSX. Then, using the Mira period luminosity relation to set the\nabsolute magnitudes, distances were determined -- to greater accuracy than has\nhitherto been possible for this type of star. Bolometric corrections to the K\nmagnitude were calculated and prescriptions derived for calculating these from\nvarious colours. Mass-loss rates were also calculated and compared to values in\nthe literature.\n  Approximately one third of the C-rich Miras and an unknown fraction of the\nnon-Miras exhibit apparently random obscuration events that are reminiscent of\nthe phenomena exhibited by the hydrogen deficient RCB stars. The underlying\ncause of this is unclear, but it may be that mass loss, and consequently dust\nformation, is very easily triggered from these very extended atmospheres.",

Instead of requiring users to\nallocate globally unique names from a central authority, UIA enables users to\nassign their own \"user-relative\" names both to their own devices and to other\nusers. With UIA, for example, Alice can always access her iPod from any of her\nown personal devices at any location via the name \"ipod\", and her friend Bob\ncan access her iPod via a relative name like \"ipod.Alice\".",

We show that\nthe model is exactly soluble even if the on-site interaction is random. But in\ncontrast to the non-random case, we observe here new phenomena: instead of\nenhancement of BEC for perfect bosons, for constant on-site repulsion and\ndiscrete distributions of the single-site potential there is suppression of BEC\nat some fractional densities. We show that this suppression appears with\nincreasing disorder. On the other hand, the BEC suppression at integer\ndensities may disappear, if disorder increases. For a continuous distribution\nwe prove that the BEC critical temperature decreases for small on-site\nrepulsion while the BEC is suppressed at integer values of density for large\nrepulsion. Again, the threshold for this repulsion gets higher, when disorder\nincreases.",

    "summary": "Packrat parsing is a novel technique for implementing parsers in a lazy\nfunctional programming language. A packrat parser provides the power and\nflexibility of top-down parsing with backtracking and unlimited lookahead, but\nnevertheless guarantees linear parse time. Any language defined by an LL(k) or\nLR(k) grammar can be recognized by a packrat parser, in addition to many\nlanguages that conventional linear-time algorithms do not support. This\nadditional power simplifies the handling of common syntactic idioms such as the\nwidespread but troublesome longest-match rule, enables the use of sophisticated\ndisambiguation strategies such as syntactic and semantic predicates, provides\nbetter grammar composition properties, and allows lexical analysis to be\nintegrated seamlessly into parsing. Yet despite its power, packrat parsing\nshares the same simplicity and elegance as recursive descent parsing; in fact\nconverting a backtracking recursive descent parser into a linear-time packrat\nparser often involves only a fairly straightforward structural change. This\npaper describes packrat parsing informally with emphasis on its use in\npractical applications, and explores its advantages and disadvantages with\nrespect to the more conventional alternatives.",

At intermediate energies, both the LT and FPs may be seen, but\nduring certain intervals emission from the legs of the loop dominates, in\ncontrast to the commonly observed LT and FP emission. The hard X-ray emission\ntends to rise above the FPs and eventually merge into a single LT source. This\nevolution starts first at low energies and proceeds to higher energies. The\nspectrum of the resultant LT source becomes more and more dominated by a\nthermal component with an increasing emission measure as the flare proceeds.\nThe soft and hard X-rays show a Neupert-type behavior. With a non-thermal\nbremsstrahlung model the brightness profile along the loop is used to determine\nthe density profile and its evolution, which reveals a gradual increase of the\ngas density in the loop. These results are evidence for chromospheric\nevaporation and are consistent with the qualitative features of hydrodynamic\nsimulations of this phenomenon.

The\nelectric field induces coherent inelastic scatterings which involve both\nintra-subband and inter-sideband transitions. Subsequently, the dc conductance\nG is found to exhibit suppressed features. These features are recognized as the\nquasi-bound-state (QBS) features which are associated with electrons making\ntransitions to the vicinity of a subband bottom, of which the density of states\nis singular. Having valley-like instead of dip-like structures, these QBS\nfeatures are different from the G characteristics for constrictions acted upon\nby a finite-range time-modulated potential. In addition, the subband bottoms in\nthe time-dependent electric field region are shifted upward by an energy\nproportional to the square of the electric field and inversely proportional to\nthe square of the frequency. This effective potential barrier is originated\nfrom the square of the vector potential and it leads to the interesting\nfield-sensitive QBS features. An experimental set-up is proposed for the\nobservation of these features.",

Shocks not only play a decisive role for the\nthermalization of gas in virialising structures but also for the acceleration\nof relativistic cosmic rays (CRs) through diffusive shock acceleration. Our\nformalism is applicable both to ordinary non-relativistic thermal gas, and to\nplasmas composed of CRs and thermal gas. To this end, we derive an analytical\nsolution to the one-dimensional Riemann shock tube problem for a composite\nplasma of CRs and thermal gas. We apply our methods to study the properties of\nstructure formation shocks in high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of the\nLCDM model. We find that most of the energy is dissipated in weak internal\nshocks with Mach numbers M~2 which are predominantly central flow shocks or\nmerger shock waves traversing halo centres. Collapsed cosmological structures\nare surrounded by external shocks with much higher Mach numbers up to M~1000,\nbut they play only a minor role in the energy balance of thermalization. We\nshow that after the epoch of cosmic reionisation the Mach number distribution\nis significantly modified by an efficient suppression of strong external shock\nwaves due to the associated increase of the sound speed of the diffuse gas.\nInvoking a model for CR acceleration in shock waves, we find that the average\nstrength of shock waves responsible for CR energy injection is higher than that\nfor shocks that dominate the thermalization of the gas. When combined with\nradiative dissipation and star formation, our formalism can also be used to\nstudy CR injection by supernova shocks, or to construct models for\nshock-induced star formation in the interstellar medium.

However, interestingly enough, each\ncomplex's value is the same either in general relativity or teleparallel\ngravity. Our results sustain that (i) general relativity or teleparallel\ngravity are equivalent theories (ii) different energy-momentum complexes do not\nprovide the same energy and momentum densities neither in general relativity\nnor in teleparallel gravity. In the context of the theory of teleparallel\ngravity, the vector and axial-vector parts of the torsion are obtained. We show\nthat the axial-vector torsion vanishes for the space-time under study.",

The observed CO\nemission lines are best fit by a power-law gas distribution of 80 M_earth\nstarting at 80 AU from the central star, indicating that there is some gas in\nthe inner hole.

    "summary": "It is well known that cosmic rays (CRs) contribute significantly to the\npressure of the interstellar medium in our own Galaxy, suggesting that they may\nplay an important role in regulating star formation during the formation and\nevolution of galaxies. We here discuss a novel numerical treatment of the\nphysics of CRs and its implementation in the parallel smoothed particle\nhydrodynamics code GADGET-2. In our methodology, the non-thermal CR population\nof each gaseous fluid element is approximated by a simple power law spectrum in\nparticle momentum, characterized by an amplitude, a cut-off, and a fixed slope.\nAdiabatic compression, and a number of physical source and sink terms are\nmodelled which modify the CR pressure of each particle. The most important\nsources considered are injection by supernovae and diffusive shock\nacceleration, while the primary sinks are thermalization by Coulomb\ninteractions, and catastrophic losses by hadronic interactions. We also include\ndiffusion of CRs. Our scheme allows us to carry out the first cosmological\nstructure formation simulations that self-consistently account for CR physics.\nIn simulations of isolated galaxies, we find that CRs can significantly reduce\nthe star formation efficiencies of small galaxies, with virial velocities below\n\\~80 km/s, an effect that becomes progressively stronger towards low mass\nscales. In cosmological simulations at high redshift, the total mass-to-light\nratio of small halos and the faint-end of the luminosity function are strongly\naffected. When CR acceleration in shocks is followed as well, up to ~40% of the\nenergy dissipated at structure formation shocks can appear as CR pressure at\nz~3-6, but this fraction drops to ~10% at low redshifts when the shock\ndistribution becomes increasingly dominated by lower Mach numbers.

A persistent, thin (less than micron-sr solid angle)\nprecessing and spinning gamma jet, with a power output comparable to the\nprogenitor supernova (SN) or XRay pulsar, may explain these issues. The\nprecessing jets may have a few hours characteristic decay time, while their\ndecreasing intensity follow a power law for thousands of years. The orientation\nof the spinning and precessing beam respect to the line of sight plays a key\nrole : the farthest GRB events in widest cosmic volumes correspond generally to\na very narrow and on-axis beam, while for the nearest ones sources are mostly\nobservable off-axis. Consequentely the far ones are the hardest and the most\nbright and viceversa nearest one are mostly softer and longest ones as in Amati\ncorrelation. We expect that nearby off-axis GRBs would be accompanied by a\nchain of OT and radio bumps as in GRB030329-SN2003 and latest GRB060218-SN2006\nevents. Delayed blazing jets are observable in the local universe as X-Ray\nFlahes (XRFs) or short GRBs often as orphan afterglow event, and at closer\ndistances as SGRs and anomalous X-ray Pulsars AXRPs. The gamma jet is\noriginated by ultra-relativistic electron pairs showering via Synchrotron (or\nInverse Compton) radiation. The electron pairs escape from the inner SN core\nthanks to a more penetrating couriers, the relativistic PeV muon pairs,\nthemselves secondaries of inner UHE hadron jets. They are 'transparent' through\nthe SN shells of matter and lights; they decay far away in to electron pairs\n(and later on) in gamma and neutrinos jets. Then GRBs (and SGRs) are not the\nmost explosive event of the Universe, but just the most beamed ones.",

But there have been problems: the star is too bright\ncompared to its peers and it has unusually shaped absorption line profiles,\nleading some to suggest that it is a distorted, rapidly rotating star seen\npole-on. Here we report optical interferometric observations of Vega which\ndetect the asymmetric brightness distribution of the bright, slightly offset\npolar axis of a star rotating at 93% of breakup speed. In addition to\nexplaining the unusual brightness and line shape pecularities, this result\nleads to the prediction of an excess of near-infrared emission compared to the\nvisible, in agreement with observations. The large temperature differences\npredicted across its surface call into question composition determinations,\nadding uncertainty to Vega's age and opening the possibility that its debris\ndisk could be substantially older than previously thought.",

As the magnetic field is\nincreased the resistivity increases, reaches a maximum at the metamagnetic\ncritical field, and falls precipitously for fields just above the transition,\nwhile the amplitude of all measurable dHvA frequencies are significantly\nattenuated near the metamagnetic critical field. However, the dHvA frequencies\nand cyclotron masses are not substantially altered by the transition. In the\nlow field state, the resistivity is observed to increase toward low\ntemperatures in a singular fashion, a behavior that is rapidly suppressed above\nthe transition. Instead, in the high field state, the resistivity monotonically\nincreases with temperature with a dependence that is more singular than the\niconic Fermi-liquid, temperature-squared, behavior. Both the damping of the\ndHvA amplitudes and the increased resistivity near the metamagnetic critical\nfield indicate an increased scattering rate for charge carriers consistent with\ncritical fluctuation scattering in proximity to a phase transition. The dHvA\namplitudes do not uniformly recover above the critical field, with some\nhole-like orbits being entirely suppressed at high fields. These changes, taken\nas a whole, suggest that the metamagnetic transition in CeIrIn$_5$ is\nassociated with the polarization and localization of the heaviest of\nquasiparticles on the hole-like Fermi surface.",

The latter is spontaneously broken due to intrinsic features of the\nTMT dynamics. In the model with the inflaton \\phi alone, in different regions\nof the parameter space the following different effects can take place without\nfine tuning of the parameters and initial conditions: a) Possibility of\nresolution of the old cosmological constant problem: this is done in a\nconsistent way hinted by S.

This effect is\nachieved without any exotic term in the action. In a model with both \\phi and\n\\upsilon fields, a scenario which resembles the hybrid inflation is realized\nbut there are essential differences, for example: the Higgs field undergos\ntransition to a gauge symmetry broken phase <\\upsilon>\\neq 0 soon after the end\nof a power law inflation; there are two oscillatory regimes of \\upsilon, one\naround \\upsilon =0 at 50 e-folding before the end of inflation, another -\nduring transition to a gauge symmetry broken phase where the scalar dark energy\ndensity approaches zero without fine tuning; the gauge symmetry breakdown is\nachieved without tachyonic mass term in the action.",

We show that, in the low energy limit, the gravitational potential\ngenerated by a pointlike source may be written as $\\Phi(r) \\propto r^{-1} \\left\n[ 1 + (r/r_c)^{\\beta} \\right ]$ with $\\beta$ a function of the slope $n$ of the\ngravity Lagrangian and $r_c$ a scalelength depending on the gravitating system\nproperties.

It turns out that the potential is still\nasymptotically decreasing, but the corrected rotation curve, although not flat,\nis higher than the Newtonian one thus offering the possibility to fit rotation\ncurves without dark matter. To test the viability of the model, we consider a\nsample of 15 low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies with combined HI and\nH$\\alpha$ measurements of the rotation curve extending in the putative dark\nmatter dominated region.

The SN\nlight curve is obtained subtracting the galaxy contribution and is modelled\ntogether with two spectra at near-maximum epochs. A red VLT grism 150I spectrum\nof the SN near peak is used to extend the spectral coverage, and in particular\nto constrain the uncertain reddening, the most likely value for which is\nE_{G+H}(B-V) about 1.07 +/- 0.05. Accounting for reddening, SN 2003lw is about\n0.3 mag brighter than the prototypical GRB-SN 1998bw. Light curve models yield\na 56Ni mass of about 0.55 solar mass. The optimal explosion model is somewhat\nmore massive (ejecta mass about 13 solar mass) and energetic (kinetic energy\nabout 6 times 10^52 erg) than the model for SN 1998bw, implying a massive\nprogenitor (40 - 50 solar mass). The mass at high velocity is not very large\n(1.4 solar mass above 30000 km/s, but only 0.1 solar mass above 60000 km/s),\nbut is sufficient to cause the observed broad lines. The similarity of SNe\n2003lw and 1998bw and the weakness of their related GRBs, GRB031203 and\nGRB980425, suggest that both GRBs may be normal events viewed slightly off-axis\nor a weaker but possibly more frequent type of GRB.",

Typical examples are modules over a path algebra, which is\ngraded by the path length, of a not necessarily finite quiver with relations.\nWe present a very general definition of quadratic and Koszul duality functors\nbacked up by explicit examples. This generalises previous results in two\nsubstantial ways: We work in the setup of graded categories, i.e. we allow\ninfinitely many idempotents and also define a ``Koszul'' duality functor for\nnot necessarily Koszul categories. As an illustration of the techniques we\nreprove the Koszul duality of translation and Zuckerman functors for the\nclassical category O in a quite elementary and explicit way. As applications we\npropose a definition of a \"Koszul\" dual category for integral blocks of\nHarish-Chandra bimodules and for blocks outside the critical hyperplanes for\nthe Kac-Moody category O.",

In this report we demonstrate that the transport\nproperties in those heterostructures are very sensitive to the deposition\nparameters during thin film growth. Using cathode- and photoluminescence\nstudies in conjunction with measurements of electrical transport properties and\nmicrostructure we show that the electronic properties observed at a\nLaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface can be explained by oxygen reduced SrTiO3.

This is a nearby long GRB, with a very low peak energy, and is therefore\nclassified as an X-ray Flash (XRF). XRF 060218 is clearly associated with a\nsupernova -- dubbed SN 2006aj. We present early spectra for SN 2006aj as well\nas optical lightcurves reaching out to 50 days past explosion. Our optical\nlightcurves define the rise times, the lightcurve shapes and the absolute\nmagnitudes in the U, V and R bands, and we compare these data with data for\nother relevant supernovae. SN 2006aj evolved quite fast, somewhat similarly to\nSN 2002ap, but not as fast as SN 1994I. Our spectra show the evolution of the\nsupernova over the peak, when the U-band portion of the spectrum rapidly fades\ndue to extensive line blanketing. We compare to similar spectra of very\nenergetic Type Ic supernovae. Our first spectra are earlier than spectra for\nany other GRB-SN. The spectrum taken 12 days after burst in the rest frame is\nsimilar to somewhat later spectra of both SN 1998bw and SN 2003dh, implying a\nrapid early evolution. This is consistent with the fast lightcurve.\n  From the narrow emission lines from the host galaxy we derive a redshift of\nz=0.0331+-0.0007. This makes XRF 060218 the second closest gamma-ray burst\ndetected. The flux of these emission lines indicate a high-excitation state,\nand a modest metallicity and star formation rate of the host galaxy.",

    "summary": "We use the recently developed tools for an exact bosonization of a finite\nnumber $N$ of non-relativistic fermions to discuss the classic Tomonaga\nproblem. In the case of noninteracting fermions, the bosonized hamiltonian\nnaturally splits into an O$(N)$ piece and an O$(1)$ piece. We show that in the\nlarge-N and low-energy limit, the O$(N)$ piece in the hamiltonian describes a\nmassless relativistic boson, while the O$(1)$ piece gives rise to cubic\nself-interactions of the boson. At finite $N$ and high energies, the low-energy\neffective description breaks down and the exact bosonized hamiltonian must be\nused. We also comment on the connection between the Tomonaga problem and pure\nYang-Mills theory on a cylinder. In the dual context of baby universes and\nmultiple black holes in string theory, we point out that the O$(N)$ piece in\nour bosonized hamiltonian provides a simple understanding of the origin of two\ndifferent kinds of nonperturbative O$(e^{-N})$ corrections to the black hole\npartition function.",

It is assumed that the field obeys general Robin boundary\nconditions on bounding surfaces. The application of a variant of the\ngeneralized Abel-Plana formula allows to extract from the expectation values\nthe contribution from single shells and to present the interference part in\nterms of exponentially convergent integrals. The vacuum forces acting on the\nboundaries are presented as the sum of self-action and interaction terms. The\nfirst one contains well-known surface divergences and needs a further\nrenormalization. The interaction forces between the cylindrical boundaries are\nfinite and are attractive for special cases of Dirichlet and Neumann scalars.\nFor the general Robin case the interaction forces can be both attractive or\nrepulsive depending on the coefficients in the boundary conditions. The total\nCasimir energy is evaluated by using the zeta function regularization\ntechnique. It is shown that it contains a part which is located on bounding\nsurfaces. The formula for the interference part of the surface energy is\nderived and the energy balance is discussed.",

Moreover,\nspatial constraints may as well play an important role, resulting in a complex\ninterplay between topology, weight, and geography. In order to study the\nvulnerability of such networks to intentional attacks, these attributes must be\ntherefore considered along with the topological quantities. In order to tackle\nthis issue, we consider the case of the world-wide airport network, which is a\nweighted heterogeneous network whose evolution and structure are influenced by\ntraffic and geographical constraints. We first characterize relevant\ntopological and weighted centrality measures and then use these quantities as\nselection criteria for the removal of vertices. We consider different attack\nstrategies and different measures of the damage achieved in the network. The\nanalysis of weighted properties shows that centrality driven attacks are\ncapable to shatter the network's communication or transport properties even at\nvery low level of damage in the connectivity pattern. The inclusion of weight\nand traffic therefore provides evidence for the extreme vulnerability of\ncomplex networks to any targeted strategy and need to be considered as key\nfeatures in the finding and development of defensive strategies.",

    "summary": "We study the variation of electron transmission through Au-S-benzene-S-Au\njunctions and related systems as a function of the structure of the Au:S\ncontacts. For junctions with semi-infinite flat Au(111) electrodes, the highly\ncoordinated in-hollow and bridge positions are connected with broad\ntransmission peaks around the Fermi level, due to a broad range of transmission\nangles from transverse motion, resulting in high conductivity and weak\ndependence on geometrical variations. In contrast, for (unstable) S-adsorption\non top of an Au atom, or in the hollow of a 3-Au-atom island, the transmission\npeaks narrow up due to suppression of large transmission angles. Such more\none-dimensional situations may describe more common types of contacts and\njunctions, resulting in large variations in conductivity and sensitivity to\nbonding sites, tilting and gating. In particular, if S is adsorbed in an Au\nvacancy, sharp spectral features appear near the Fermi level due to essential\nchanges of the level structure and hybridization in the contacts, admitting\norder-of-magnitude variations of the conductivity. Possibly such a system, can\nit be fabricated, will show extremely strong non-linear effects and might work\nas uni- or bi-directional voltage-controlled 2-terminal switches and non-linear\nmixing elements. Finally, density-functional-theory (DFT) based transport\ncalculations seem relevant, being capable of describing a wide range of\ntransmission peak structures and conductivities. Prediction and interpretation\nof experimental results probably require more precise modeling of realistic\nexperimental situations.",

One is to consider a cluster as a collection of many atoms and\nevaluate the sum of two-body and three-body interatomic interactions, a common\nassumption. The other method, valid at large separation, is to consider each\ncluster as a point particle, characterized by a polarizability tensor, and\nevaluate the inter-cluster interaction. This method employs the static\npolarizability, evaluated by including all many-body (MB) intra-cluster atomic\ninteractions self-consistently, which yields the full inter-cluster\ninteraction, including all MB terms. A comparison of the results from the two\nmethods reveals that the contribution of the higher-than-three-body MB\ninteractions is always attractive and non-negligible, with a relative\nimportance that varies with geometry. The procedure is quite general and is\napplicable to any shape or size of dielectric clusters, in principle. We\npresent numerical results for clusters composed of atoms with polarizability\nconsistent with silica, for which the higher-than-three-body MB correction term\ncan be as high as 42% of the atomic pair-wise sum. The full result is quite\nsensitive to the anisotropic structure of the cluster, in contrast to the\nresult found in the additive case, which is orientation independent.

    "summary": "The term proposition usually denotes in quantum mechanics (QM) an element of\n(standard) quantum logic (QL). Within the orthodox interpretation of QM the\npropositions of QL cannot be associated with sentences of a language stating\nproperties of individual samples of a physical system, since properties are\nnonobjective in QM. This makes the interpretation of propositions\nproblematical. The difficulty can be removed by adopting the objective\ninterpretation of QM proposed by one of the authors (semantic realism, or SR,\ninterpretation). In this case, a unified perspective can be adopted for QM and\nclassical mechanics (CM), and a simple first order predicate calculus L(x) with\nTarskian semantics can be constructed such that one can associate a physical\nproposition (i.e., a set of physical states) with every sentence of L(x). The\nset $P^{f}$ of all physical propositions is partially ordered and contains a\nsubset $P^{f}_{T}$ of testable physical propositions whose order structure\ndepends on the criteria of testability established by the physical theory. In\nparticular, $P^{f}_{T}$ turns out to be a Boolean lattice in CM, while it can\nbe identified with QL in QM. Hence the propositions of QL can be associated\nwith sentences of L(x), or also with the sentences of a suitable quantum\nlanguage $L_{TQ}(x)$, and the structure of QL characterizes the notion of\ntestability in QM. One can then show that the notion of quantum truth does not\nconflict with the classical notion of truth within this perspective.\nFurthermore, the interpretation of QL propounded here proves to be equivalent\nto a previous pragmatic interpretation worked out by one of the authors, and\ncan be embodied within a more general perspective which considers states as\nfirst order predicates of a broader language with a Kripkean semantics.",

    "summary": "Total magnetic fields in spiral galaxies, as observed through their total\nsynchrotron emission, are strongest (up to \\simeq 30\\mu G) in the spiral arms.\nThe degree of radio polarization is low; the field in the arms must be mostly\nturbulent or tangled. Polarized synchrotron emission shows that the resolved\nregular fields are generally strongest in the interarm regions (up to \\simeq\n15\\mu G), sometimes forming 'magnetic arms' parallel to the optical arms. The\nfield structure is spiral in almost every galaxy, even in flocculent and bright\nirregular types which lack spiral arms. The observed large-scale patterns of\nFaraday rotation in several massive spiral galaxies reveal coherent regular\nfields, as predicted by dynamo models. However, in most galaxies observed so\nfar no simple patterns of Faraday rotation could be found. Either many dynamo\nmodes are superimposed and cannot be resolved by present-day telescopes, or\nmost of the apparently regular field is in fact anisotropic random, with\nfrequent reversals, due to shearing and compressing gas flows. In galaxies with\nmassive bars, the polarization pattern follows the gas flow. However, around\nstrong shocks in bars, the compression of the regular field is much lower than\nthat of the gas; the regular field decouples from the cold gas and is strong\nenough to affect the flow of the diffuse warm gas. -- The average strength of\nthe total magnetic field in the Milky Way is 6\\mu G near the sun and increases\nto 20-40\\mu G in the Galactic center region. The Galactic field is mostly\nparallel to the plane, except in the center region. Rotation measure data from\npulsars indicate several field reversals, unlike external galaxies, but some\nreversals could be due to distortions of the nearby field.",

The models thereby\nsuppress the masses $m_b$ and $m_\\tau$ relative to $m_t$, and $m_s$ and $m_\\mu$\nrelative to $m_c$ because the masses of the $Q=-1/3$ quarks and charged leptons\nrequire mixing between the two ETC groups, while the masses of the $Q=2/3$\nquarks do not. A related source of the differences between these mass\nsplittings is the effect of the two hierarchies of breaking scales of the two\nETC groups. We analyze a particular model of this type in some detail.

This diagram was\nconstructed using photometry from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Supernova\nLegacy Survey and absorption line spectroscopy from the Keck observatory. The\nmethod used to measure distances to these supernovae is based on recent work by\nHamuy & Pinto (2002) and exploits a correlation between the absolute brightness\nof SNe II-P and the expansion velocities derived from the minimum of the Fe II\n516.9 nm P-Cygni feature observed during the plateau phases. We present three\nrefinements to this method which significantly improve the practicality of\nmeasuring the distances of SNe II-P at cosmologically interesting redshifts.\nThese are an extinction correction measurement based on the V-I colors at day\n50, a cross-correlation measurement for the expansion velocity and the ability\nto extrapolate such velocities accurately over almost the entire plateau phase.\nWe apply this revised method to our dataset of high-redshift SNe II-P and find\nthat the resulting Hubble diagram has a scatter of only 0.26 magnitudes, thus\ndemonstrating the feasibility of measuring the expansion history, with present\nfacilities, using a method independent of that based upon supernovae of Type\nIa.",

We use a multipolar expansion of the lens potential and show\nthat the time-varying nature of the quadrupole contribution allows to separate\nit from the mass and spin contributions and leads to specific modulations of\nthe amplification signal. As example we study the case of binary system lenses\nin our galaxy. The modulation is observable if the rotation period of the\nsystem is smaller than the time over which the amplification is significant and\nif the impact parameter of the passing light ray is sufficiently close to the\nEinstein radius so that the amplification is large. Observations of this\nmodulation can reveal important information on the quadrupole and thus on the\ngravitational radiation emitted by the binary lens. Even if not observed\ndirectly, because of their importance the quadrupole modulation has to be\nincluded in the error budget for high magnification ($\\mu\\leq7$) microlensing\nevents.",

We find\nthat the long gamma-ray bursts are far more concentrated on the very brightest\nregions of their host galaxies than are the core-collapse supernovae.\nFurthermore, the host galaxies of the long gamma-ray bursts are significantly\nfainter and more irregular than the hosts of the core-collapse supernovae.\nTogether these results suggest that long-duration gamma-ray bursts are\nassociated with the most massive stars and may be restricted to galaxies of\nlimited chemical evolution.

The Euler-Lagrange equations were solved by\ndirect variational method. The approximate analytical expression for the\nparaelectric-ferroelectric transition temperature dependence on nanoparticle\nsizes, polarization gradient coefficient, extrapolation length, effective\nsurface tension and electrostriction coefficient was derived. It was shown that\nthe transition temperature could be higher than the one of the bulk material\nfor nanorods and nanowires in contrast to nanodisks, where the decrease takes\nplace. The critical sizes and volume of ferroelectric-paraelectric phase\ntransition are calculated. We proved that among all cylindrical shapes a\nnanobar reveals the minimal critical volume. We predicted the enhancement of\nferroelectric properties in nanorods and nanowires.

We show that the process of\ninterface detachment, which immediately precedes the inception of frictional\nsliding, is governed by three different types of detachment fronts. These\ncrack-like detachment fronts differ by both their propagation velocities and by\nthe amount of net contact surface reduction caused by their passage. The most\nrapid fronts propagate at intersonic velocities but generate a negligible\nreduction in contact area across the interface. Sub-Rayleigh fronts are\ncrack-like modes which propagate at velocities up to the Rayleigh wave speed,\nVR, and give rise to an approximate 10% reduction in net contact area. The most\nefficient contact area reduction (~20%) is precipitated by the passage of slow\ndetachment fronts. These fronts propagate at anomalously slow velocities, which\nare over an order of magnitude lower than VR yet orders of magnitude higher\nthan other characteristic velocity scales such as either slip or loading\nvelocities. Slow fronts are generated, in conjunction with intersonic fronts,\nby the sudden arrest of sub-Rayleigh fronts. No overall sliding of the\ninterface occurs until either of the slower two fronts traverses the entire\ninterface, and motion at the leading edge of the interface is initiated. Slip\nat the trailing edge of the interface accompanies the motion of both the slow\nand sub-Rayleigh fronts.

We confront our expectations with the\nrecent RHIC data of the STAR collaboration on the probability, $P$, for\nemission of at least one fast hadron at a central rapidity in association with\nproduction of a very forward high $p_t$ neutral pion in $pp$ and $dAu$\ncollisions.

We use these data to constrain the halo occupation\ndistribution (HOD), then calculate the PVD by populating the halos of a high\nresolution N-body simulation. We examine the luminosity and scale dependence of\nthe predicted PVD. At r<1 Mpc/h and r>3 Mpc/h, we find that the PVD decreases\nwith increasing galaxy luminosity. This result is mostly driven by the fraction\nof satellite galaxies f_sat, which is well-constrained by the correlation\nfunction. We find f_sat~25% for galaxies fainter than L_star, while for\nbrighter galaxies the satellite fraction rapidly declines, creating the\ndecrease in the PVD with luminosity. At r=1 Mpc/h, the PVD has no dependence on\nluminosity because satellite galaxies dominate the statistics for all objects.\nRecent measurements of the PVD in Fourier space using the \"dispersion model\"\nhave reported a strong decline in PVD with increasing luminosity at k=1 h/Mpc.\nWe test this method with our HOD models, finding that there is no consistent\ncomparison between the PVD at a given k and the true dispersion at a given\nvalue of r. This results in a luminosity dependence in k-space that is stronger\nthan in configuration space. The luminosity dependence of the HOD results in\nFourier space are consistent with those measured at k=1 h/Mpc; thus the recent\nmeasurements of the PVD are fully explainable in the context of halo occupation\nmodels. The normalization of the PVD is lower than predicted by our fiducial\nmodel, and reproducing it requires a lower value of Omega_m (~0.2 instead of\n0.3), a lower value of sigma_8 (~0.7 instead of 0.9), or strong velocity bias.",

The exterior\n(regressive) algebra is shown to share the exterior (progressive) algebra in\nthe direct sum of chiral and achiral subspaces. The duality between scalars and\nvolume elements, respectively under the progressive and the regressive products\nis shown to have chirality, in the case when the dimension n of the Peano space\nis even. In other words, the counterspace volume element is shown to be a\nscalar or a pseudoscalar, depending on the dimension of the vector space to be\nrespectively odd or even. The de Rham cochain associated with the differential\noperator is constituted by a sequence of exterior algebra homogeneous subspaces\nsubsequently chiral and achiral. Thus we prove that the exterior algebra over\nthe space and the exterior algebra constructed on the counterspace are only\npseudoduals each other, when we introduce chirality. The extended Clifford\nalgebra is introduced in the light of the periodicity theorem of Clifford\nalgebras context, wherein the Clifford and extended Clifford algebras Cl(p,q)\ncan be embedded in Cl(p+1,q+1), which is shown to be exactly the extended\nClifford algebra. Clifford algebras are constructed over the counterspace, and\nthe duality between progressive and regressive products is presented using the\ndual Hodge star operator. The differential and codifferential operators are\nalso defined for the extended exterior algebras from the regressive product\nviewpoint, and it is shown they uniquely tumble right out progressive and\nregressive exterior products of 1-forms.",

    "summary": "We construct a model of phantom energy using the graded Lie algebra SU(2/1).\nThe negative kinetic energy of the phantom field emerges naturally from the\ngraded Lie algebra, resulting in an equation of state with w<-1. The model also\ncontains ordinary scalar fields and anti-commuting (Grassmann) vector fields\nwhich can be taken as two component dark matter. A potential term is generated\nfor both the phantom fields and the ordinary scalar fields via a postulated\ncondensate of the Grassmann vector fields. Since the phantom energy and dark\nmatter arise from the same Lagrangian the phantom energy and dark matter of\nthis model are coupled via the Grassman vector fields. In the model presented\nhere phantom energy and dark matter come from a gauge principle rather than\nbeing introduced in an ad hoc manner.",

It has been demonstrated that in models in\nwhich the quartification gauge symmetry is broken down to the standard model\ngauge group, gauge coupling constant unification can be achieved, and there is\nno unique scenario. The same is also true when the leptonic colour gauge group\nis only partially broken, leaving a remnant SU(2)_\\ell symmetry at the standard\nmodel level. Here we perform an analysis of the neutrino mass spectrum of such\nmodels. We show that these models do not naturally generate small Majorana\nneutrino masses, thus correcting an error in our earlier quartification paper,\nbut with the addition of one singlet neutral fermion per family there is a\nrealisation of see-saw suppressed masses for the neutrinos.

We divide the spectra into ten\nspectrophotometric bandpasses, five for each grating, of equal wavelength span\nwithin each grating, and fit a transit curve over all bandpasses\nsimultaneously. In our fit we use theoretical values for the stellar\nlimb-darkening to further constrain the planetary radius. We find that the\nradius of HD 209458b is 1.320 +/- 0.025 R_Jup, which is a factor of two more\nprecise than current estimates. We also obtain improved estimates for the\norbital period P and time of center of transit T_C. Although in principle the\nphoton-limited precision of the STIS data should allow us to measure the timing\nof individual transits to a precision of 2-7 s, we find that systematic\ninstrumental offsets in the measured flux from one orbit of the spacecraft to\nthe next degrade these measurements to a typical precision of +/- 14 s.

The principal intracellular\nmediators of TGF-beta signalling are the Smad proteins, which upon TGF-beta\nstimulation accumulate in the nucleus and regulate transcription of target\ngenes. To investigate the mechanisms of Smad nuclear accumulation, we developed\na simple mathematical model of canonical Smad signalling. The model was built\nusing both published data and our experimentally determined cellular Smad\nconcentrations (isoforms 2, 3, and 4). We found in mink lung epithelial cells\nthat Smad2 (8.5-12 x 10^4 molecules/cell) was present in similar amounts to\nSmad4 (9.3-12 x 10^4 molecules/cell), while both were in excess of Smad3\n(1.1-2.0 x 10^4 molecules/cell). Variation of the model parameters and\nstatistical analysis showed that Smad nuclear accumulation is most sensitive to\nparameters affecting the rates of RSmad phosphorylation and dephosphorylation\nand Smad complex formation/dissociation in the nucleus. Deleting Smad4 from the\nmodel revealed that rate-limiting phospho-R-Smad dephosphorylation could be an\nimportant mechanism for Smad nuclear accumulation. Furthermore, we observed\nthat binding factors constitutively localised to the nucleus do not efficiently\nmediate Smad nuclear accumulation if dephosphorylation is rapid. We therefore\nconclude that an imbalance in the rates of R-Smad phosphorylation and\ndephosphorylation is likely an important mechanism of Smad nuclear accumulation\nduring TGF-beta signalling.",

We conclude that this\ndiscrepancy is due to the limitations of 1D models. Our newly derived effective\ntemperatures and bolometric luminosities bring the Magellanic Cloud RSGs into\ngood agreement with stellar evolutionary models that include the effects of\nrotation. A typical M2~I in the SMC is about 150 K cooler than its Galactic\ncounterpart; one in the LMC is about 50 K cooler. This is in the sense expected\ndue to the lower chemical abundances in the SMC and LMC, although it is not\nsufficient to explain the shift in average RSG spectral type seen between the\nSMC, LMC, and Milky Way. Instead, that is due primarily to the change in\nHayashi limit with metallicity, as first proposed by Elias et al.

    "summary": "The general stability criteria of inviscid Taylor-Couette flows with angular\nvelocity $\\Omega(r)$ are obtained analytically. First, a necessary instability\ncriterion for centrifugal flows is derived as $\\xi'(\\Omega-\\Omega_s)<0$ (or\n$\\xi'/(\\Omega-\\Omega_s)<0$) somewhere in the flow field, where $\\xi$ is the\nvorticitiy of profile and $\\Omega_s$ is the angular velocity at the inflection\npoint $\\xi'=0$. Second, a criterion for stability is found as\n$-(\\mu_1+1/r_2)<f(r)=\\frac{\\xi'}{\\Omega-\\Omega_s}<0$, where $\\mu_1$ is the\nsmallest eigenvalue. The new criteria are the analogues of the criteria for\nparallel flows, which are special cases of Arnol'd's nonlinear criteria.\nSpecifically, Pedley's cirterion is proved to be an special case of Rayleigh's\ncriterion. Moreover, the criteria for parallel flows can also be derived from\nthose for the rotating flows. These results extend the previous theorems and\nwould intrigue future research on the mechanism of hydrodynamic instability.",

A large part of the \\eta-scatter is due to the\nnoise in the HeII flux. However, the real data contain more low-\\eta events\nthan simulation sample. This discrepancy may indicate that the mechanism\nleading extra fluctuations upon the simulation data, such as a fluctuating UV\nradiation background, is needed.

Assuming that Galactic CRs of energy below ~\n100 TeV are accelerated by supernova remnant (SNR) shock waves and that the\nshock compression ratio is SNR age dependent, the average source injection\nspectra from an ensemble of SNRs is calculated both in the inner (330<l<30) and\nouter (30<l<330) regions of the galaxy. The calculation considers the SNR age\ndistribution in the galaxy. Injecting these spectra in the galaxy and using a\n3-D convection-diffusion equation, the CR electrons and protons spectra in the\ntwo galactic regions are obtained and their spectra in the galactic disk are\nfound to be flatter than the observed CR spectra. The diffuse gamma-ray\nspectrum produced by the interaction of these galactic CRs with the ISM and\nISRFs is compared with the experimental data in both the galactic regions.\nFurthermore, the steepening of the observed local CR spectra from the galactic\ndisk CR spectra are discussed by propagating local CRs having a source spectrum\nderived using local SNR age distribution (SNRs located within 1.5 kpc from the\nSun), for a diffusion coefficient D_0 ~ 0.3\\times 10^{27} cm^2 s^{-1} in the\nlocal region which is much less than the typical value in the galaxy D_0 ~\n(1-10)\\times 10^{28} cm^2 s^{-1}.

In this paper we analyze adaptive phase measurements of this type for a\nrealistic model of a squeezed beam. We show that, provided it is possible to\nsuitably choose the parameters of the beam, a mean-square phase uncertainty\nscaling as (N/kappa)^{-5/8} is possible, where kappa is the linewidth of the\nbeam resulting from the fluctuating phase. This is an improvement over the\n(N/kappa)^{-1/2} scaling found previously for coherent beams.

A phenomenological model of prestellar core evolution, a\ntime-dependent chemical model, and a radiative transfer simulation for\nmolecular lines are combined to reconstruct the chemical and kinematical\nstructure of this core. We developed a general criterion that allows to\nquantify the difference between observed and simulated spectral maps. By\nminimizing this difference, we find that very high and very low values of the\neffective sticking probability $S$ are not appropriate for the studied\nprestellar core. The most probable $S$ value for CB17 is 0.3--0.5. The spatial\ndistribution of the intensities and self-absorption features of optically thick\nlines is indicative of UV irradiation of the core. By fitting simultaneously\noptically thin and optically thick transitions, we isolate the model that\nreproduces all the available spectral maps to a reasonable accuracy. The line\nasymmetry pattern in CB17 is reproduced by a combination of infall, rotation,\nand turbulent motions with velocities $\\sim0.05$ km s$^{-1}$, $\\sim0.1$ km\ns$^{-1}$, and $\\sim0.1$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively. These parameters corresponds\nto energy ratios $E_{\\rm rot}/E_{\\rm grav}\\approx0.03$, $E_{\\rm therm}/E_{\\rm\ngrav}\\approx0.8$, and $E_{\\rm turb}/E_{\\rm grav}\\approx0.05$ (the rotation\nparameters are determined for $i=90^\\circ$). The chemical age of the core is\nabout 2 Myrs. In particular, this is indicated by the central depletion of CO,\nCS, and HCO$^+$. Based on the angular momentum value, we argue that the core is\ngoing to fragment, i.e., to form a binary (multiple) star. (abridged)",

    "summary": "We study the statistics of charge transfer through an impurity in a chiral\nLuttinger liquid (realized experimentally as a quantum point contact in a\nfractional quantum Hall edge state device). Taking advantage of the\nintegrability we present a procedure for obtaining the cumulant generating\nfunction of the probability distribution to transfer a fixed amount of charge\nthrough the constriction. Using this approach we analyze in detail the\nbehaviour of the third cumulant C_3 as a function of applied voltage,\ntemperature and barrier height. We predict that C_3 can be used to measure the\nfractional charge at temperatures, which are several orders of magnitude higher\nthan those needed to extract the fractional charge from the measurement of the\nsecond cumulant. Moreover, we identify the component of C_3, which carries the\ninformation about the fractional charge.",

A simple\nnonconstructive argument shows that when m is sufficiently large compared to n,\nmost 3CNF formulas are not satisfiable. It is an open question whether there is\nan efficient refutation algorithm that for most such formulas proves that they\nare not satisfiable. A possible approach to refute a formula $\\phi$ is: first,\ntranslate it into a graph $G_{\\phi}$ using a generic reduction from 3-SAT to\nmax-IS, then bound the maximum independent set of $G_{\\phi}$ using the Lovasz\n$\\vartheta$ function. If the $\\vartheta$ function returns a value $< m$, this\nis a certificate for the unsatisfiability of $\\phi$. We show that for random\nformulas with $m < n^{3/2 -o(1)}$ clauses, the above approach fails, i.e. the\n$\\vartheta$ function is likely to return a value of m.",

This model doesn't scale well when there is tight integration of\nmultiple hierarchies. In a case where there is joint-tenancy and a requirement\nfor different levels of disclosure based upon a user's hierarchy, or in our\ncase, organization or company, basic RBAC requires these hierarchies to be\neffectively merged. Specific roles that effectively represent both the user's\norganizations and roles must be translated to fit within the merged hierarchy\nto be used to control access. Essentially, users from multiple organizations\nare served from a single role base with roles designed to constrain their\naccess as needed.\n  Our work proposes, through parameterized roles and privileges, a means for\naccurately representing both users' roles within their respective hierarchies\nfor providing access to controlled objects. Using this method will reduce the\namount of complexity required in terms of the number of roles and privileges.\nThe resulting set of roles, privileges, and objects will make modeling and\nvisualizing the access role hierarchy significantly simplified. This paper will\ngive some background on role based access control, parameterized roles and\nprivileges, and then focus on how RBAC with parameterized roles and privileges\ncan be leveraged as an access control solution for the problems presented by\njoint tenancy.",

The measurement\nyields: m_b(M_Z) = 2.85 +/- 0.18 (stat) +/- 0.13 (exp) +/- 0.19 (had) +/- 0.12\n(theo) GeV/c^2 for the CAMBRIDGE algorithm. This result is the most precise\nmeasurement of the b mass derived from a high energy process. When compared to\nother b mass determinations by experiments at lower energy scales, this value\nagrees with the prediction of Quantum Chromodynamics for the energy evolution\nof the running mass. The mass measurement is equivalent to a test of the\nflavour independence of the strong coupling constant with an accuracy of 7\npermil.",

We see bright emission from\nthat part of the cloud associated with the photon-dominated region (PDR) at the\n`top' of the horse's head, which we label B33-SMM1. We characterise the\nphysical parameters of the extended dust responsible for this emission, and\nfind that B33-SMM1 contains a more dense core than was previously suspected. We\ncompare the SCUBA data with data from the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) and\nfind that the emission at 6.75-\\mum is offset towards the west, indicating that\nthe mid-infrared emission is tracing the PDR while the submillimetre emission\ncomes from the molecular cloud core behind the PDR. We calculate the virial\nbalance of this core and find that it is not gravitationally bound but is being\nconfined by the external pressure from the HII region IC434, and that it will\neither be destroyed by the ionising radiation, or else may undergo triggered\nstar formation. Furthermore we find evidence for a lozenge-shaped clump in the\n`throat' of the horse, which is not seen in emission at shorter wavelengths. We\nlabel this source B33-SMM2 and find that it is brighter at submillimetre\nwavelengths than B33-SMM1. SMM2 is seen in absorption in the 6.75-\\mum ISO\ndata, from which we obtain an independent estimate of the column density in\nexcellent agreement with that calculated from the submillimetre emission. We\ncalculate the stability of this core against collapse and find that it is in\napproximate gravitational virial equilibrium. This is consistent with it being\na pre-existing core in B33, possibly pre-stellar in nature, but that it may\nalso eventually undergo collapse under the effects of the HII region.",

The effect is quantified by the computation of the luminosity\nfunction (LF) of red galaxies. We found a flat slope, showing that the\nabundance of red galaxies is similar at faint and at intermediate magnitudes.\nComparison with present-day and z~0.4 LFs suggests that the slope of the LF is\nnot changed, within the errors, between z=0.831 and z=0. Therefore, the\nanalysis of the LF shows no evidence for a decreasing (with magnitude or\nredshift) number of faint red galaxies. The presence of faint red galaxies in\nhigh redshift clusters disfavours scenarios where the evolution of red galaxies\nis mass-dependent, because the mass dependency should differentially\ndepauperate the red sequence, while the MS1054-0321 colour-magnitude relation\nis populated as in nearby clusters and as in z~0.4 clusters. The presence of\nabundant faint red galaxies in the high redshift cluster MS1054-0321 restricts\nthe room for allocating descendants of Butcher-Oemler galaxies, because they\nshould change the faint end slope of the LF of red galaxies, while instead the\nsame faint end slopes are observed in MS1054-0321, at z~0 and at z~0.4. In the\nrich MS1054-0321 cluster, the colour-magnitude relation seems to be fully in\nplace at z=0.831 and therefore red galaxies of all magnitudes were wholly\nassembled at higher redshift.",

An elementary\nprobabilistic computation shows that a sufficient but not excessive number of\ntrials (a few tens) ensures that the exhibition of this common basis is\nguaranteed in spite of possible errors in the detection of edges. When this\nfirst step is performed, the search of similarity between the two images\nreduces to counting the coincidence of edges in the two images.

    "summary": "This paper defines the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS) Early Data\nRelease (EDR). UKIDSS is a set of five large near-infra-red surveys defined by\nLawrence et al. (2006), being undertaken with the UK Infra-red Telescope\n(UKIRT) Wide Field Camera (WFCAM). The programme began in May 2005 and has an\nexpected duration of seven years. Each survey uses some or all of the broadband\nfilter complement ZYJHK. The EDR is the first public release of data to the\nEuropean Southern Observatory (ESO) community. All worldwide releases occur\nafter a delay of 18 months from the ESO release. The EDR provides a small\nsample dataset, ~50 sq.deg (about 1% of the whole of UKIDSS), that is a lower\nlimit to the expected quality of future survey data releases. In addition, an\nEDR+ dataset contains all EDR data plus extra data of similar quality, but for\nareas not observed in all of the required filters (amounting to ~220 sq.deg).\nThe first large data release, DR1, will occur in mid-2006. We provide details\nof the observational implementation, the data reduction, the astrometric and\nphotometric calibration, and the quality control procedures. We summarise the\ndata coverage and quality (seeing, ellipticity, photometricity, depth) for each\nsurvey and give a brief guide to accessing the images and catalogues from the\nWFCAM Science Archive.",

Nineteen of\nthese sources are carbon stars. An examination of the near- and mid-infrared\nphotometry shows that the carbon-rich and oxygen-rich dust sources follow two\neasily separated sequences. A comparison of the spectra of the 19 carbon stars\nin the SMC to spectra from the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) of carbon stars\nin the Galaxy reveals significant differences. The absorption bands at 7.5 um\nand 13.7 um due to C2H2 are stronger in the SMC sample, and the SiC dust\nemission feature at 11.3 um is weaker. Our measurements of the MgS dust\nemission feature at 26-30 um are less conclusive, but this feature appears to\nbe weaker in the SMC sample as well. All of these results are consistent with\nthe lower metallicity in the SMC. The lower abundance of SiC grains in the SMC\nmay result in less efficient carbon-rich dust production, which could explain\nthe excess C2H2 gas seen in the spectra. The sources in the SMC with the\nstrongest SiC dust emission tend to have redder infrared colors than the other\nsources in the sample, which implies more amorphous carbon, and they also tend\nto show stronger MgS dust emission. The weakest SiC emission features tend to\nbe shifted to the blue; these spectra may arise from low-density shells with\nlarge SiC grains.",

Under boundary conditions directly extrapolated from those in\nstandard General Relativity, black hole configurations, white hole\nconfigurations and the combination of both into a black hole--white hole\nconfiguration are shown to be stable.

For that, an\naccurate knowledge of the evolutionary state of stars that have a measured\nmagnetic field is an important diagnostic. Previous results based on a small\nand possibly biased sample suggest that the distribution of magnetic stars with\nmass below 3 M_sun in the H-R diagram differs from that of normal stars in the\nsame mass range (Hubrig et al. 2000). In contrast, higher mass magnetic Bp\nstars may well occupy the whole main-sequence width (Hubrig, Schoeller & North\n2005). In order to rediscuss the evolutionary state of upper main sequence\nmagnetic stars, we define a larger and bias-free sample of Ap and Bp stars with\naccurate Hipparcos parallaxes and reliably determined longitudinal magnetic\nfields. We used FORS1 at the VLT in its spectropolarimetric mode to measure the\nmagnetic field in chemically peculiar stars where it was unknown or poorly\nknown as yet. In this first paper we present our results of the mean\nlongitudinal magnetic field measurements in 136 stars. Our sample consists of\n105 Ap and Bp stars, two PGa stars, 17 HgMn stars, three normal stars, and nine\nSPB stars. A magnetic field was for the first time detected in 57 Ap and Bp\nstars, in four HgMn stars, one PGa star, one normal B-type star and four SPB\nstars.",

As pouring proceeds, a small stream\nof liquid occasionally leaps upward from the heap. This surprising effect,\nwhich lasts only a second or so, is named after its first observer A. Kaye, who\ncould offer no explanation for this behaviour. Later, Collyer and Fischer\nsuggested from 250 frames per second cine recordings that the fluid must be\nhighly shear thinning as well as elastic and 'pituitous'. In addition, they\nconcluded that a rigid surface is required to back the reflected liquid stream.\nWhile the words bouncing and reflection are associated with non-continuous and\nelastic effects, we will show here that the Kaye effect is in fact a continuous\nflow phenomenon. We show that the Kaye effect works for many common fluids,\nincluding shampoos and liquid soaps. We reveal its physical mechanism\n(formation, stability and disruption) through high-speed imaging. The\nmeasurements are interpreted with a simple theoretical model including only the\nshear thinning behaviour of the liquid; elastic properties of the liquid play\nno role.

    "summary": "A symmetrical binary, A+B Lennard-Jones mixture is studied by a combination\nof semi-grandcanonical Monte Carlo (SGMC) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) methods\nnear a liquid-liquid critical temperature $T_c$. Choosing equal chemical\npotentials for the two species, the SGMC switches identities (${\\rm A} \\to {\\rm\nB} \\to {\\rm A}$) to generate well-equilibrated configurations of the system on\nthe coexistence curve for $T<T_c$ and at the critical concentration, $x_c=1/2$,\nfor $T>T_c$. A finite-size scaling analysis of the concentration susceptibility\nabove $T_c$ and of the order parameter below $T_c$ is performed, varying the\nnumber of particles from N=400 to 12800. The data are fully compatible with the\nexpected critical exponents of the three-dimensional Ising universality class.\n  The equilibrium configurations from the SGMC runs are used as initial states\nfor microcanonical MD runs, from which transport coefficients are extracted.\nSelf-diffusion coefficients are obtained from the Einstein relation, while the\ninterdiffusion coefficient and the shear viscosity are estimated from\nGreen-Kubo expressions. As expected, the self-diffusion constant does not\ndisplay a detectable critical anomaly. With appropriate finite-size scaling\nanalysis, we show that the simulation data for the shear viscosity and the\nmutual diffusion constant are quite consistent both with the theoretically\npredicted behavior, including the critical exponents and amplitudes, and with\nthe most accurate experimental evidence.",

    "summary": "Although the importance of protein dynamics in protein function is generally\nrecognized, the role of protein fluctuations in allosteric effects scarcely has\nbeen considered. To address this gap, the Kullback-Leibler divergence (Dx)\nbetween protein conformational distributions before and after ligand binding\nwas proposed as a means of quantifying allosteric effects in proteins. Here,\nprevious applications of Dx to methods for analysis and simulation of proteins\nare first reviewed, and their implications for understanding aspects of protein\nfunction and protein evolution are discussed. Next, equations for Dx suggest\nthat k_{B}TDx should be interpreted as an allosteric free energy -- the free\nenergy associated with changing the ligand-free protein conformational\ndistribution to the ligand-bound conformational distribution. This\ninterpretation leads to a thermodynamic model of allosteric transitions that\nunifies existing perspectives on the relation between ligand binding and\nchanges in protein conformational distributions. The definition of Dx is used\nto explore some interesting mathematical relations among commonly recognized\nthermodynamic and biophysical quantities, such as the total free energy change\nupon ligand binding, and ligand-binding affinities for individual protein\nconformations. These results represent the beginnings of a theoretical\nframework for considering the full protein conformational distribution in\nmodeling allosteric transitions. Early applications of the framework have\nproduced results with implications both for methods for coarsed-grained\nmodeling of proteins, and for understanding the relation between ligand binding\nand protein dynamics.",

Inherent\nto the indispensability of proteins for living cells is the fact that a given\nprotein can adopt a specific three-dimensional shape that is specified solely\nby the proteins sequence of amino acids. Over the past several decades,\nstructural biologists have demonstrated that the array of structures that\nproteins may adopt is quite astounding, and this has lead to a strong interest\nin understanding how protein structures change and evolve over time. In this\nreview we consider a large body of recent work that attempts to illuminate this\nstructure-centric picture of protein evolution. Much of this work has focused\non the question of how completely new protein structures (i.e. new folds or\ntopologies) are discovered by protein sequences as they evolve. Pursuant to\nthis question of structural innovation has been a desire to describe and\nunderstand the observation that certain types of protein structures are far\nmore abundant than others and how this uneven distribution of proteins\nimplicates on the process through which new shapes are discovered. We consider\na number of theoretical models that have been successful at explaining this\nheterogeneity in protein populations and discuss the increasing amount of\nevidence that indicates that the process of structural evolution involves the\ndivergence of protein sequences and structures from one another.",

However, only the V/Vmax method is\nusually employed in computing the white dwarf luminosity function and other\nmethods have not been applied so far to the observational sample of\nspectroscopically identified white dwarfs. Moreover, the statistical\nsignificance of the white dwarf luminosity function has also received little\nattention and a thorough study still remains to be done. In this paper we\nstudy, using a controlled synthetic sample of white dwarfs generated using a\nMonte Carlo simulator, which is the statistical significance of the white dwarf\nluminosity function and which are the expected biases. We also present a\ncomparison between different estimators for computing the white dwarf\nluminosity function. We find that for sample sizes large enough the V/Vmax\nmethod provides a reliable characterization of the white dwarf luminosity\nfunction, provided that the input sample is selected carefully. Particularly,\nthe V/Vmax method recovers well the position of the cut-off of the white dwarf\nluminosity function. However, this method turns out to be less robust than the\nCholoniewski method when the possible incompletenesses of the sample are taken\ninto account. We also find that the Choloniewski method performs better than\nthe V/Vmax method in estimating the overall density of white dwarfs, but misses\nthe exact location of the cut-off of the white dwarf luminosity function.",

The integral (sum) of the GDH Sum Rule can be\ngeneralized to the case of virtual photons.

I also discuss extensions of\nGurvits' NP-hardness result to strong NP-hardness of certain related problems.\nA major open question is whether the NP-contained formulation (QSEP) of the\nquantum separability problem is Karp-NP-complete; QSEP may be the first natural\nexample of a problem that is Turing-NP-complete but not Karp-NP-complete.\nFinally, I survey all the proposed (deterministic) algorithms for the quantum\nseparability problem, including the bounded search for symmetric extensions\n(via semidefinite programming), based on the recent quantum de Finetti theorem;\nand the entanglement-witness search (via interior-point algorithms and global\noptimization). These two algorithms have the lowest complexity, with the latter\nbeing the best under advice of asymptotically optimal point-coverings of the\nsphere.",

Following this\nprinciple, solutions are proposed for improving communication within\nbureaucracies, sensing public satisfaction, dynamic modification of\nhierarchies, and contextualization of procedures. Each of these reduces\nfriction between agents (internal or external), increasing the efficiency of\nbureaucracies. \"Random agent networks\" (RANs), novel computational models, are\nintroduced to illustrate the benefits of self-organizing bureaucracies.",

We fit a flexible, multi-component, empirical\nSED model of star-forming galaxies designed to model the entire ~1-1000um\nwavelength range. The fits are performed with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\napproach, allowing for meaningful uncertainties to be derived. This approach\nalso highlights degeneracies such as between Td and beta, which we discuss in\ndetail. From these fits and standard relations we derive: L_IR, L_PAH, SFR,\ntau_V, M_star, M_dust, Td, and beta. We look at a variety of correlations\nbetween these and combinations thereof in order to examine the physical nature\nof these galaxies. Our conclusions are supplemented by morphological\nexamination of the sources, and comparison with local samples. We find the bulk\nof our sample to be consistent with fairly standard size and mass disk galaxies\nwith somewhat enhanced star-formation relative to local spirals, but likely not\nbona fide starbursts. A few higher-z LIGs and ULIGs are also present, but\ncontrary to expectation, they are weak mid-IR emitters and overall are\nconsistent with star-formation over an extended cold region rather than\nconcentrated in the nuclear regions. We discuss the implications of this study\nfor understanding populations detected at other wavelengths, such as the bright\n850um SCUBA sources or the faint Spitzer 24um sources.",

We characterize possible sources of\nultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) by their mean density in the local\nUniverse, $\\bar{\\rho} = 10^{-r}$ Mpc$^{-3}$, with $r$ between 3 and 6.\n  These densities span a wide range of extragalactic sites for UHECR sources,\nfrom common to rare galaxies or even clusters of galaxies.

We\npresent a model-independent way of constraining this signal with observations\nof the Galactic Plane in diffuse gamma rays. We combine detections by the EGRET\ninstrument at GeV energies and the Milagro Cherenkov detector at TeV energies\nwith upper limits from KASCADE and CASA-MIA ground arrays at PeV energies. Such\na long \"lever arm\", spanning at least six orders of magnitude in energy,\nreveals a \"TeV excess\" in the diffuse Galactic Plane gamma-ray spectrum. While\nthe origin of this excess is unknown, it likely implies also enhanced TeV\nneutrino fluxes, significantly improving the prospects for their detection. We\nshow that unresolved point sources are a possible source of the TeV excess. In\nfact, the spectra of the unidentified EGRET sources in the Milagro region must\nbreak between ~10 GeV and ~1 TeV to avoid strongly overshooting the Milagro\nmeasurement; this may have important implications for cosmic-ray acceleration.\n  Finally, we use our approach to examine the recent suggestion that\ndark-matter annihilation may account for the observed excess in diffuse\nGalactic gamma-rays detected by EGRET at energies above 1 GeV. Within our\nmodel-independent approach, current data cannot rule this possibility in or\nout; however we point out how a long \"lever arm\" can be used to constrain the\npionic gamma-ray component and in turn limit the \"GeV excess\" and its possible\nsources. Experiments such as HESS and MAGIC, and the upcoming VERITAS and\nGLAST, should be able to finally disentangle the main sources of the Galactic\ngamma rays.",

    "summary": "We have carried out sensitive 1.3 mm observations of 20 young brown dwarfs in\nthe Taurus star-forming region, representing the largest sample of young\nsubstellar objects targeted in a deep millimeter continuum survey to date.\nUnder standard assumptions, the masses of brown dwarf disks range from ~<0.4 to\nseveral Jupiter masses. Their relative disk masses are comparable to those\nderived for coeval low-mass stars: most of them are in the ~<1-5% range, and\nthere is no clear change of relative disk mass with object mass from 0.015 to 3\nsolar masses. Specifically, we do not find evidence for disk truncation, as\nwould be expected in the ejection scenario for brown dwarf origin, although the\nsignature of ejection may be hidden in our non-detections. We use the derived\nmm fluxes, complemented by mid-infrared data from the Spitzer Space Telescope\nand ground-based near-infrared images, to construct spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) for six of our sources, and model those SEDs with a Monte\nCarlo radiative transfer code. While the model fits are by no means unique,\nthey allow us to investigate disk properties such as the degree of flaring and\nminimum radii. In several cases, we find that the SEDs in the mid-infrared\nexhibit lower flux levels than predicted by hydrostatic models, implying dust\nsettling to the disk midplane. What's more, at least 25% of our targets are\nlikely to have disks with radii >10 AU; models with smaller disks cannot\nreproduce the mm fluxes even if they are very massive. This finding is in\ncontrast to the results of some simulations of the ejection scenario for brown\ndwarf formation that suggest only ~5% of ejected objects would harbor disks\nlarger than 10 AU. Our findings imply that ejection is probably not the\ndominant formation process, but may still be relevant for some brown dwarfs.",

The theory covers recent\nexperiments in which the ultracold neutrons were beamed between a mirror and a\nrough scatterer/absorber. The analysis is based on a recently developed theory\nof quantum transport along random rough walls which is modified in order to\ninclude leaky (absorbing) interfaces and, more importantly, the low-amplitude\nhigh-aperture roughness. The calculations are focused on a regime when the\ndirect transitions into the continuous spectrum above the absorption threshold\ndominate the depletion of neutrons from the gravitational states and are more\nefficient than the processes involving the intermediate states. The theoretical\nresults for the neutron count are sensitive to the correlation radius (lateral\nsize) of surface inhomogeneities and to the ratio of the particle energy to the\nabsorption threshold in a weak roughness limit. The main impediment for\nobservation of the higher gravitational states is the \"overhang\" of the\nparticle wave functions which can be overcome only by use scatterers with\nstrong roughness. In general, the strong roughness with high amplitude is\npreferable if one wants just to detect the individual gravitational states,\nwhile the strong roughness experiments with small amplitude and high aperture\nare preferable for the quantitative analysis of the data. We also discuss the\nways to further improve the accuracy of calculations and to optimize the\nexperimental regime.",

In particular, interesting regions of large $\\tan \\beta$ and small\n$m_A$ are probed by searches for heavy neutral Higgs bosons, A and H, when they\ndecay to $\\tau^+ \\tau^-$ and $b\\bar{b}$. At the same time, direct searches for\ndark matter, such as CDMS, attempt to observe neutralino dark matter particles\nscattering elastically off nuclei. This can occur through t-channel Higgs\nexchange, which has a large cross section in the case of large $\\tan \\beta$ and\nsmall $m_A$. As a result, there is a natural interplay between the heavy,\nneutral Higgs searches at the Tevatron and the region of parameter space\nexplored by CDMS. We show that if the lightest neutralino makes up the dark\nmatter of our universe, current limits from CDMS strongly constrain the\nprospects of heavy, neutral MSSM Higgs discovery at the Tevatron (at 3 sigma\nwith 4 fb^-1 per experiment) unless $|\\mu| \\gsim$ 400 GeV. The limits of CDMS\nprojected for 2007 will increase this constraint to $|\\mu| \\gsim$ 800 GeV.

The quotient $\\mathbb{H}^3/\\Gamma$ is hence a\ncompact hyperbolic 3-orbifold, of which we study the hyperbolic volume and\nspectrum of closed geodesic lengths using SnapPea.

The proposed gate is then used to design reversible ripple\ncarry and carry skip adders. It is demonstrated that the adder architectures\ndesigned using the proposed gate are much better and optimized, compared to\ntheir existing counterparts in literature; in terms of number of reversible\ngates and garbage outputs.

For a more dense circumburst\nmedium, this effect is more significant. As samples, taking this effect into\naccount, we specifically calculate the efficiency of two bursts whose\nparameters were well constrained. Almost the same results are derived.

Furthermore, in the past Fredkin gates have been constructed using DNA,\nwhose outputs are used as inputs for other Fredkin gates. Thus, it can be\nconcluded that arbitrary circuits of Fredkin gates can be constructed using\nDNA. This paper provides the initial threshold to building of more complex\nsystem having reversible sequential circuits and which can execute more\ncomplicated operations. The novelty of the paper is the reversible designs of\nsequential circuits using Fredkin gate. Since, Fredkin gate has already been\nrealized using DNA, it is expected that this work will initiate the building of\ncomplex systems using DNA. The reversible circuits designed here are highly\noptimized in terms of number of gates and garbage outputs. The modularization\napproach that is synthesizing small circuits and thereafter using them to\nconstruct bigger circuits is used for designing the optimal reversible\nsequential circuits.",

The measurements cover the kinematic range of 0.6 GeV/c < p_T<1.2\nGeV/c in transverse momentum and -0.15<x_F<0.01 in Feynman-x. The polarization\nresults from the two different targets agree within the statistical error. In\nthe combined data set, the largest deviation from zero, +0.054 +- 0.029, is\nmeasured for x_F < -0.07. Zero polarization is expected at x_F=0 in the absence\nof nuclear effects. The polarization results for the Lambda agree with a\nparametrization of previous measurements which were performed at positive x_F\nvalues, where the Lambda polarization is negative. Results of Anti-Lambda\npolarization measurements are consistent with zero.",

We show in detail how\nthis can be achieved, while preserving perturbativity and consistency with the\nelectroweak precision tests, by extending the Standard Model to include a\nsecond Higgs doublet that has neither a vev nor couplings to quarks and\nleptons. This Inert Doublet Model yields a perturbative and completely natural\ndescription of electroweak physics at all energies up to 1.5 TeV. The discrete\nsymmetry that yields the Inert Doublet is unbroken, so that Dark Matter may be\ncomposed of neutral inert Higgs bosons, which may have escaped detection at\nLEP2. Predictions are given for multilepton events with missing transverse\nenergy at the Large Hadron Collider, and for the direct detection of dark\nmatter.",

The star formation rate (SFR) is derived\nfrom the ultraviolet continuum for the galaxies and group members, and from\nemission line fluxes for the cluster galaxies. The stellar masses are computed\nfrom multi-band photometry including the near-infrared bands for the galaxies\nand groups, and from the dynamical mass for the cluster sample.\n  Results: For the first time, integrated SSFRs for clusters and groups are\npresented and related to the SSFRs of field galaxies. Tentatively, we find a\ncontinuous upper limit for galaxies, groups, and clusters in the SSFR-stellar\nmass plane over seven orders of magnitude in stellar mass. This might indicate\nthat the physical processes which control star formation in dark matter haloes\nof different mass have the same scaling with mass over a wide range of masses\nfrom dwarf galaxies to massive clusters of galaxies.",

The\nformer is a $3 \\times 3$ array of nine observables commuting pairwise in each\nrow and column and arranged so that their product properties contradict those\nof the assigned eigenvalues. The latter is a set of ten observables arranged in\nfive groups of four lying along five edges of the pentagram and characterized\nby similar contradiction. An interesting one-to-one correspondence between the\noperators of the Mermin-Peres square and the points of the projective line over\nthe product ring ${\\rm GF}(2) \\otimes \\rm{GF}(2)$ is established. Under this\nmapping, the concept \"mutually commuting\" translates into \"mutually distant\"\nand the distinguishing character of the third column's observables has its\ncounterpart in the distinguished properties of the coordinates of the\ncorresponding points, whose entries are both either zero-divisors, or units.\nThe ten operators of the Mermin pentagram answer to a specific subset of points\nof the line over GF(2)[$x$]/$<x^{3} - x>$. The situation here is, however, more\nintricate as there are two different configurations that seem to serve equally\nwell our purpose. The first one comprises the three distinguished points of the\n(sub)line over GF(2), their three \"Jacobson\" counterparts and the four points\nwhose both coordinates are zero-divisors; the other features the neighbourhood\nof the point ($1, 0$) (or, equivalently, that of ($0, 1$)).

In this work, we mainly focus our attention to the constraints on\nthe model from the gold sample of type Ia supernovae (SNeIa), the first year\ndata from the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) and the baryon acoustic\noscillation (BAO) peak found in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). At 99.73%\nconfidence level, the combination of the three databases provides\nOmega_m=0.270^{+0.018}_{-0.017} and Omega_{r_c}=0.216^{+0.012}_{-0.013} (hence\na spatially closed universe with Omega_k=-0.350^{+0.080}_{-0.083}), which seems\nto be in contradiction with the most recent WMAP results indicating a flat\nuniverse. Based on this result, we also estimated the transition redshift (at\nwhich the universe switches from deceleration to acceleration) to be 0.70 <\nz_{q=0} < 1.01, at 2 sigma confidence level.",

A similar family of solitons is found in the discrete system,\nincluding a peakon; beyond the peakon, the family continues in the form of\ncuspons. Stability of the lattice solitons is explored through computation of\neigenvalues for small perturbations, and by direct simulations. A small part of\nthe family is unstable (in that case, the discrete solitons transform into\nrobust pulsonic excitations); both peakons and cuspons are stable. The\nVakhitov-Kolokolov criterion precisely explains the stability of regular\nsolitons and peakons, but does not apply to cuspons. In-phase and out-of-phase\nbound states of solitons are also constructed. They exchange their stability at\na point where the bound solitons are peakons.

Combining this value with an earlier\norbital period determination, we were able to derive the period excess, which\nis equal to 3.5 +/- 1.6%, and estimate the mass ratio of the binary system as\nequal to q=0.16 +/- 0.07.\n  During the entire superoutburst, the period decreased at a rate of $\\dot\nP/P_{\\rm sh} = -6.3(1.4) \\times 10^{-5}$.

Taking Feynman's $+i\\epsilon$\nprescription, rather than than one of the more usual approaches, we calculated\nthe quantum amplitude (not just the probability density) for final weak-field\nconfigurations following gravitational collapse to a black hole with subsequent\nevaporation. What we have done is to find quantum amplitudes relating to a pure\nstate at late times following black-hole matter collapse. Such pure states are\nthen shown to be susceptible to a description in terms of coherent and squeezed\nstates - in practice, this description is not very different from that for the\nwell-known highly-squeezed final state of the relic radiation background in\ninflationary cosmology. The simplest such collapse model involves Einstein\ngravity with a massless scalar field. The Feynman approach involves making the\nboundary-value problem for gravity and a massless scalar field well-posed. To\ndefine this, let T be the proper-time separation, measured at spatial infinity,\nbetween two space-like hypersurfaces on which initial (collapse) and final\n(evaporation) data are posed. Then, in this approach, one rotates T by a\ncomplex phase exp(-i\\delta) into the lower half-plane. In an adiabatic\napproximation, the resulting quantum amplitude may be expressed in terms of\ngeneralised coherent states of the quantum oscillator, and a physical\ninterpretation is given.

The probability time window for the incoming earthquake is for the\ntidal minimum approximately one day and for the maximum- two days. The\nstatistic evidence for reliability is based on of distributions of the time\ndifference between occurred and predicted earthquakes for the period 2002- 2005\nfor Sofia region and 2004- 2005 for Skopje. The project for complex Balkan-\nBlack Sea region NETWORK for earthquake prediction by using the reliable\nprecursors will be proposed in near future. The Project is based on the\ntemporary data acquisition system for preliminary archiving, testing,\nvisualizing and analyzing of the data with aim to prepare regional daily risk\nestimation.",

Two of the\nbrighter sources are found to have ionizing fluxes of ~2.5x10^52, whereas the\nfainter ones have ~1x10^52 photons/s. Comparing with a one Myr old starburst,\nwe derive stellar masses in the range (3-5)x10^5 Msun, and find that the number\nof O-stars in each compact source is typically (0.6-1.6)x10^3. We conclude that\nthe compact mid-infrared sources are likely to be young, embedded star\nclusters, of which only a few are known so far.

Then, for\nrotationally invariant ensembles, I derive a master equation for the average\ndensity of eigenvalues in the complex plane, in the limit of infinitely large\nmatrices. This is achieved by resumming all the planar diagrams which appear in\nthe perturbative expansion of the hermitized Green function. Remarkably, this\nresummation can be carried {\\em explicitly} for any rotationally invariant\nensemble. I prove that in the limit of infinitely large matrices, the shape of\nthe eigenvalue distribution is either a disk or an annulus. This is the\ncelebrated ``Single-Ring'' Theorem. Which of these shapes is realized is\ndetermined by the parameters (coupling constants) which determine the ensemble.\nBy varying these parameters a phase transition may occur between the two\npossible shapes. I briefly discuss the universal features of this transition.\nAs the analysis of this problem relies heavily on summation of planar Feynman\ndiagrams, I take special effort at presenting a pedagogical exposition of the\ndiagrammatic method, which some readers may find useful.",

The estimated oxygen abundances for our\nluminous star-forming intermediate redshift galaxies cover the same range as\ntheir local counterparts. However, at a given galaxy luminosity, many of our\ngalaxies have significantly lower oxygen abundances, i.e., $(12+log(O/H))~8.6$,\nthan local galaxies with similar luminosities. Interestingly, these luminous,\nmassive, intermediate redshift, star-forming galaxies with low oxygen\nabundances exhibit physical conditions, i.e., emission line equivalent width\nand ionization state, very similar to those of local faint and metal-poor\nstar-forming galaxies. The oxygen abundance of the interstellar gas does not\nseem to correlate with the maximum rotation velocity or the emission scale\nlength of the parent galaxy.

    "summary": "Conventional turbo codes (CTCs) usually employ a block-oriented interleaving\nso that each block is separately encoded and decoded. As interleaving and\nde-interleaving are performed within a block, the message-passing process\nassociated with an iterative decoder is limited to proceed within the\ncorresponding range. This paper presents a new turbo coding scheme that uses a\nspecial interleaver structure and a multiple-round early termination test\ninvolving both sign check and a CRC code. The new interleaver structure is\nnaturally suited for high speed parallel processing and the resulting coding\nsystem offers new design options and tradeoffs that are not available to CTCs.\nIn particular, it becomes possible for the decoder to employ an efficient\ninter-block collaborative decoding algorithm, passing the information obtained\nfrom termination test proved blocks to other unproved blocks. It also becomes\nimportant to have a proper decoding schedule. The combined effect is improved\nperformance and reduction in the average decoding delay (whence the required\ncomputing power). A memory (storage) management mechanism is included as a\ncritical part of the decoder so as to provide additional design tradeoff\nbetween performance and memory size. It is shown that the latter has a\nmodular-like effect in that additional memory units render enhanced performance\ndue not only to less forced early terminations but to possible increases of the\ninterleaving depth. Depending on the decoding schedule, the degree of\nparallelism and other decoding resources available, the proposed scheme admits\na variety of decoder architectures that meet a large range of throughput and\nperformance demands.",

Our\nsample consists of 17 massive, star-forming, mostly disk galaxies with\nM_{B}<-20, in clusters with redshifts in the range 0.31< z <0.59, with a median\nof <z>=0.42. We compare these galaxies with the identically selected and\nanalysed intermediate-redshift field sample of Mouhcine et al.

The star-forming galaxies in\nintermediate-redshift clusters display emission line equivalent widths which\nare, on average, significantly smaller than measured for field galaxies at\ncomparable redshifts. However, a contrasting fraction of our cluster galaxies\nhave equivalent widths similar to the highest observed in the field. This\ntentatively suggests a bimodality in the star-formation rates per unit\nluminosity for galaxies in distant clusters. We find no evidence for further\nbimodalities, or differences between our cluster and field samples, when\nexamining additional diagnostics and the oxygen abundances of our galaxies.\nThis maybe because no such differences exist, perhaps because the cluster\ngalaxies which still display signs of star-formation have recently arrived from\nthe field.

The photoionizing power of PopIII stars\nfades for z < 10 because of the concomitant action of radiative and chemical\nfeedbacks, which causes the reionization process to stretch considerably and to\nend only by z = 6. The combination of different data sets still favours a\nnon-zero contribution from metal-free stars, forming with efficiencies > 2%.",

The assumption of total pressure equilibrium yields a more\nphysical description of the WA, resulting in the natural stratification of the\nionized gas, and providing an explanation for the presence of lines from\ndifferent ionization states, as observed in WA spectra. We have used the\nphotoionization code TITAN to compute a grid of constant total pressure models\nwith the purpose of fitting the WA in NGC 3783. We have compared our models to\nthe 900 ks Chandra spectrum of NGC 3783 and to previous studies where the WA\nwas described by multiple zones of constant density. Our results show that the\nWA features in NGC 3783 can be well reproduced by a clumpy, ionized gas with\ncosmic abondances, ionization parameter = 2500 erg cm s^-1, column density = 4\n10^22 cm^-2, and constant total pressure.

    "summary": "It is well-known that the peak brightness of the Type Ia supernovae\ncalibrated with Cepheid distances can be used to determine the Hubble constant.\nThe Cepheid distances to host galaxies of the calibrating supernovae are\nusually obtained using the period-luminosity (PL) relation derived from Large\nMagellanic Cloud (LMC) Cepheids. However recent empirical studies provide\nevidence that the LMC PL relation is not linear. In this Letter we determine\nthe Hubble constant using both the linear and non-linear LMC Cepheid PL\nrelations as calibrating relations to four galaxies that hosted Type Ia\nsupernovae. Our results suggest that the obtained values of the Hubble constant\nare similar. However a typical error of $\\sim0.03$mag. has to be added (in\nquadrature) to the systematic error for the Hubble constant when the linear LMC\nPL relation is used, assuming that the LMC PL relation is indeed non-linear.\nThis is important in minimizing the total error of the Hubble constant in the\nera of precision cosmology. The Hubble constants calibrated from the linear and\nnon-linear LMC PL relation are H_0 = 74.92+-2.28(random)+-5.06(systematic)\nkm/s/Mpc and H_0 = 74.37+-2.27(random)+-4.92(systematic) km/s/Mpc,\nrespectively. Hubble constants calculated using the Galactic PL relations are\nalso briefly discussed and presented in the last section of this Letter.",

We investigate the dependence\nof $M_{cr}$ upon the parameters of the quark model (the Bag constant $B$, the\npairing gap $\\Delta$, and the surface tension $\\sigma$ of the quark-hadron\ninterphase) and for different parametrization of the hadronic equations of\nstate. The dependence of $M_{cr}$ on $B$, $\\Delta$ and $\\sigma$ is mild if the\nparameters of the quark model correspond to hybrid stars, and strong if they\ncorrespond to strange stars. For a large part of the parameter space\ncorresponding to hybrid stars, the critical mass is very close (but smaller\nthan) the maximum mass of hadronic stars, and therefore compatible with a\n\"mixed\" population of compact stars (pure hadronic up to the critical mass and\nhybrid above the critical mass). For very large $B$ the critical mass is never\nsmaller than the maximum mass of hadronic stars, implying that quark stars\ncannot form through the here studied mechanism.

In this paper we present 3-band HST\nimages of nine type II quasars with redshifts 0.2 < z < 0.4 selected from the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey based on their emission line properties. The intrinsic\nluminosities of these AGN are estimated to be -24 > M_B > -26, but optical\nobscuration allows their host galaxies to be studied unencumbered by bright\nnuclei. Each object has been imaged in three continuum filters (`UV', `blue'\nand `yellow') placed between the strong emission lines. The spectacular, high\nquality images reveal a wealth of details about the structure of the host\ngalaxies and their environments. Six of the nine galaxies in the sample are\nellipticals with de Vaucouleurs light profiles, one object has a well-defined\ndisk component and the remaining two have marginal disks. Stellar populations\nof type II quasar hosts are more luminous (by a median of 0.3-0.7 mag,\ndepending on the wavelength) and bluer (by about 0.4 mag) than are M* galaxies\nat the same redshift. When smooth fits to stellar light are subtracted from the\nimages, we find both positive and negative residuals that become more prominent\ntoward shorter wavelengths. We argue that the negative residuals are due to\nkpc-scale dust obscuration, while most positive residuals are due to the light\nfrom the nucleus scattered off interstellar material in the host galaxy.\nScattered light makes a significant contribution to the broad band continuum\nemission and can be the dominant component of the extended emission in the UV\nin extreme cases.",

Several developments not contemplated at the start of the program in 1990\nhave made it necessary to put the summary on H_0 on a broader basis than\noriginally thought, making four preparatory papers necessary. The new Cepheid\ndistances of the subset of 10 galaxies, which were hosts of normal SNeIa, give\nweighted mean luminosities in B, V, and I at maximum light of -19.49, -19.46,\nand -19.22, respectively. These calibrate the adopted SNeIa Hubble diagram from\nPaper III to give a global value of H_0 = 62.3 +/- 1.3 (random) +/- 5.0\n(systematic). Local values of H_0 between 4.4 and 30 Mpc from Cepheids, SNeIa,\n21cm-line widths, and the tip of the red-giant branch (TRGB) all agree within\n5% of our global value. This agreement of H_0 on all scales from 4 - 200 Mpc\nfinds its most obvious explanation in the smoothing effect of vacuum energy on\nthe otherwise lumpy gravitational field due to the non-uniform distribution of\nthe local galaxies. The physical methods of time delay of gravitational lenses\nand the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect are consistent (but with large errors) with\nour global value. The present result is also not in contradiction with existing\nanalyses of CMB data, because they either lead to wide error margins of H_0 or\ndepend on the choice of unwarrented priors that couple the value of H_0 with a\nnumber of otherwise free parameters in the CMB acoustic waves. Our value of H_0\nis 14% smaller than the value of H_0 found by Freedman et al. (2001) because\nour independent Cepheid distances to the six SNeIa-calibrating galaxies used in\nthat analysis average 0.35mag larger than those used earlier.",

We\nextend our analysis to SPS heavy ion data. Again, we find that the nontrivial\ncentrality dependence of particle production (being stronger than at RHIC) is\nsimply due to an increasing corona contribution with decreasing centrality. The\ncore contribution shows no centrality dependence (concerning particle ratios),\nand can be described in exactly the same way as at RHIC, with one exception:\nthere is somewhat less collective radial flow at SPS compared to RHIC.

The\nbehavior of the first derivative of the order parameter with respect to the\ncontrol parameter is consistent with a phase transition and exhibits a sharp\npeak at the transition point. For different resources distribution, the\ntransition point is shifted, an effect similar to pressure in PVT system. The\ninverse of the parameter related to sexual selection strength behaves like an\nexternal field in the system and, as thus, is also a control parameter.

Lower third generation squark masses, in turn, diminish the\neffect of a large top quark Yukawa coupling in the running of the higgs mass\nparameter m_{H_u}^2, leading to a reduction in the magnitude of the\nsuperpotential mu parameter (relative to M_1 and M_2). A low | mu | parameter\ngives rise to mixed higgsino dark matter (MHDM), which can efficiently\nannihilate in the early universe to give a dark matter relic density in accord\nwith WMAP measurements. We explore the phenomenology of the low |M_3| scenario,\nand find for the case of MHDM increased rates for direct and indirect detection\nof neutralino dark matter relative to the mSUGRA model. The sparticle mass\nspectrum is characterized by relatively light gluinos, frequently with\nm(gl)<<m(sq). If scalar masses are large, then gluinos can be very light, with\ngl->Z_i+g loop decays dominating the gluino branching fraction. Top squarks can\nbe much lighter than sbottom and first/second generation squarks. The presence\nof low mass higgsino-like charginos and neutralinos is expected at the CERN\nLHC.

Depending on the location\nin phase space, the dynamics can possess different number of propagating\ndegrees of freedom, including purely topological sectors. This inhomogeneity of\nphase space requires special care in the analysis.\n  Background solutions in the canonical sectors, which have regular dynamics\nwith maximal number of degrees of freedom, are shown to exist. Within this\nclass, explicit solutions given by locally AdS spacetimes with nontrivial gauge\nfields are constructed, and BPS states are identified. It is shown that the\ncharge algebra acquires a central extension due to the presence of the matter\nfields. The Bogomol'nyi bound for these charges is discussed. Special attention\nis devoted to the N=4 case since then the gauge group has a U(1) central charge\nand the phase space possesses additional irregular sectors.",

This is in\ncontradiction to standard evolutionary scenarios that suggest a He-star\nprogenitor with M >2.1-2.3M_sun and in sharp contrast to a velocity of ~100\nkm/s predicted by these models. It requires a new previously unseen type of\ngravitational collapse. Our (generally ignored) prediction of a low peculiar\nmotion was confirmed later by pulsar timing observations that found v_\\bot < 30\nkm/s. Recently Willems et al. put forward an elaborate simulation suggesting\nthat in spite of these observations, the most likely natal kick is large\n(50-170 km/s) and the corresponding most likely progenitor mass is large as\nwell. We refute this claim and show that Willems et al. implicitly assume the\nresult that they obtain.",

In this framework, we show how 4D gravity can be\nlocalized on a scalar thick brane which does not necessarily respect reflection\nsymmetry, generalizing in this way several previous models based on the\nRandall-Sundrum (RS) system and avoiding both, the restriction to orbifold\ngeometries and the introduction of the branes in the action by hand. We first\nobtain a thick brane solution that preserves 4D Poincar'e invariance and breaks\nZ_2-symmetry along the extra dimension which, indeed, can be either compact or\nextended, and supplements brane solutions previously found by other authors. In\nthe non-compact case, this field configuration represents a thick brane with\npositive energy density centered at y=c_2, whereas pairs of thick branes arise\nin the compact case. Remarkably, the Weylian scalar curvature is non-singular\nalong the fifth dimension in the non-compact case, in contraposition to the RS\nthin brane system. We also recast the wave equations of the transverse\ntraceless modes of the linear fluctuations of the classical background into a\nSchr\"odinger's equation form with a volcano potential of finite bottom in both\nthe compact and the extended cases. We solve Schr\"odinger equation for the\nmassless zero mode m^2=0 and obtain a single bound wave function which\nrepresents a stable 4D graviton.

We find a significant offset from the local relation,\nin the sense that velocity dispersions were smaller for given black hole masses\nat $z=0.36$ than locally. We investigate various sources of systematic\nuncertainties and find that those cannot account for the observed offset.

The primary\nmotivation for beginning infrared imaging of the sample was to identify the\nhost galaxies of the ~30% of sources for which the EIS I-band imaging failed to\nproduce a likely candidate. In addition, K-band magnitudes allow photometric\nredshift estimation and I - K colours aid the identification of host galaxies\n(which are typically old, red ellipticals). Of the sources observed in the I\nand K-bands, four remain undetected, possibly indicating high redshifts for the\nhost galaxies, and eight involve complicated radio structures, or several\ncandidate host galaxies, which have yet to be resolved. Thus, the host galaxy\nidentifications are brought to 92% completeness.\n  In conjunction with spectroscopic observations, the K-band magnitudes have\nbeen aperture corrected and used to establish a K-z relation for the CENSORS\nradio galaxies. This relation is of interest because of its variation, at z >\n1, between radio surveys of different flux-density limit. Establishing this\nrelation for CENSORS may shed light on the origin of this variation and will\nallow an appropriate K-z redshift estimator for any CENSORS source which\nremains without a spectroscopic redshift.

    "summary": "With the creation of ultracold atoms and molecules, a new type of chemistry -\n\"resonance\" chemistry - emerges: chemical reactions can occur when the energy\nof colliding atoms and molecules matches a bound state of the combined molecule\n(Feshbach resonance). This chemistry is rather similar to reactions that take\nplace in nuclei at low energies. In this paper we suggest some problems for\nfuture experimental and theoretical work related to the resonance chemistry of\nultracold molecules. Molecular Bose-Einstein condensates are particularly\ninteresting because in this system collisions and chemical reactions are\nextremely sensitive to weak fields; also, a preferred reaction channel may be\nenhanced due to a finite number of final states. The sensitivity to weak fields\narises due to the high density of narrow compound resonances and the\nmacroscopic number of molecules with kinetic energy E=0 (in the ground state of\na mean-field potential). The high sensitivity to the magnetic field may be used\nto measure the distribution of energy intervals, widths, and magnetic moments\nof compound resonances and study the onset of quantum chaos. A difference in\nthe production rate of right-handed and left-handed chiral molecules may be\nproduced by external electric and magnetic fields and the finite width of the\nresonance. The same effect may be produced by the parity-violating energy\ndifference in chiral molecules.",

We present observations of GRB 050607, the\nfourth case of a GRB discovered by Swift with flares superimposed on the\noverall fading X-ray afterglow. The flares of GRB 050607 were not symmetric as\nin previously reported cases, showing a very steep rise and a shallower decay,\nsimilar to the Fast Rise, Exponential Decay that are frequently observed in the\ngamma-ray prompt emission. The brighter flare had a flux increase by a factor\nof approximately 25,peaking for 30 seconds at a count rate of approximately 30\ncounts s-1, and it presented hints of addition short time scale activity during\nthe decay phase. There is evidence of spectral evolution during the flares. In\nparticular, at the onset of the flares the observed emission was harder, with a\ngradual softening as each flare decayed. The very short time scale and the\nspectral variability during the flaring activity are indicators of possible\nextended periods of energy emission by the GRB central engine. The flares were\nfollowed by a phase of shallow decay, during which the forward shock was being\nrefreshed by a long-lived central engine or by shells of lower Lorentz factors,\nand by a steepening after approximately 12 ks to a decay slope considered\ntypical of X-ray afterglows.",

In our model, the qubit is an isolated system\nconsisting of a small island (Cooper-pair box) and a larger superconductor\n(reservoir) connected with each other by a tunable Josephson junction. If such\nsystem contains an odd number of electrons, then even at lowest temperatures a\nsingle quasiparticle is present in the qubit. Tunneling of a quasiparticle\nbetween the reservoir and the Cooper-pair box results in the relaxation of the\nqubit. We derive master equations governing the evolution of the qubit\ncoherences and populations. We find that the kinetics of the qubit can be\ncharacterized by two time scales - quasiparticle escape time from reservoir to\nthe box, $\\Gamma^{-1}_{in}$, and quasiparticle relaxation time $\\tau$. The\nformer is determined by the dimensionless normal-state conductance $g_T$ of the\nJosephson junction and one-electron level spacing $\\delta_r$ in the reservoir\n($\\Gamma_{in}\\sim g_T\\delta_r$), and the latter is due to electron-phonon\ninteraction. We find that phase coherence is damped on the time scale of\n$\\Gamma^{-1}_{in}$.

Although X-ray observations indicate that the galactic black hole Sgr\nA$^*$ is inactive now, we suggest that Sgr A$^*$ can become active when a\ncaptured star is tidally disrupted and matter is accreted into the black hole.\nAs a consequence the galactic black hole could be a powerful source of\nrelativistic protons. We are able to explain the current observed diffuse\ngamma-rays and the very detailed 511 keV annihilation line of secondary\npositrons by $p-p$ collisions of such protons, with appropriate injection times\nand energy. Relativistic protons could have been injected into the ambient\nmaterial if the black hole captured a 50M$_\\odot$ star at several tens million\nyears ago. An alternative possibility is that the black hole continues to\ncapture stars with $\\sim$1M$_\\odot$ every hundred thousand years. Secondary\npositrons produced by $p-p$ collisions at energies $\\ga 30$ MeV are cooled down\nto thermal energies by Coulomb collisions, and annihilate in the warm neutral\nand ionized phases of the interstellar medium with temperatures about several\neV, because the annihilation cross-section reaches its maximum at these\ntemperatures. It takes about ten million years for the positrons to cool down\nto thermal temperatures so they can diffuse into a very large extended region\naround the Galactic center. A much more recent star capture may be also able to\naccount for recent TeV observations within 10 pc of the galactic center as well\nas for the unidentified GeV gamma-ray sources found by EGRET at GC. The\nspectral difference between the GeV flux and the TeV flux could be explained\nnaturally in this model as well.",

    "summary": "Non-Abelian gauge fields are traditionally not coupled to torsion due to\nviolation of gauge invariance. However, it is possible to couple torsion to\nYang-Mills fields while maintaining gauge invariance provided one accepts that\nthe gauge couplings then become scalar fields. In the past this has been\nuntenable from experimental constraints at the current epoch for the\nelectromagnetic field at least. Recent researches on the \"landscape\" arising\nout of string theory provides for many scalar fields which eventually determine\nthe various low energy parameters including gauge couplings in the universe.\nWith this scenario, we argue that the very early universe provides a\nRiemann-Cartan geometry with non-zero torsion coupling to gauge fields. The\ntorsion is just the derivative of gauge coupling (scalar) fields. As a result,\nin the evolution of the Universe, when the scalar (moduli) fields determine the\ngeometry of the universe to be Riemannian, torsion goes to zero, implying that\nthe associated modulus (and hence the gauge coupling) has a constant value. An\nequivalent view is that the modulus fixes the gauge coupling at some constant\nvalue causing the torsion to vanish as a consequence. Of course, when torsion\nvanishes we recover Einstein's theory for further evolution of the universe.",

For two transmit antennas max-log bit\nsoft-output information can be generated and for greater than two antennas\napproximate max-log detection is achieved.

    "summary": "A significant number of the known multiple exoplanetary systems are\ncontaining a pair of giant planets engaged in a low order mean motion\nresonance. Such a resonant condition protects the dynamics of these planets\nresulting in very stable orbits. According to recent studies the capture into a\nresonance is the result of a planetary migration process induced by the\ninteraction of the planets with a protoplanetary disk. If the migration is slow\nenough (adiabatic) next to a mean motion resonance, the two planets will also\nbe in apsidal corotation.\n  The recently refined orbital parameters of the system HD 128311 suggest that\nthe two giant planets are in a 2:1 mean motion resonance, however without\nexhibiting apsidal corotation. Thus the evolution of this system can not be\ndescribed by an adiabatic migration process alone.\n  We present possible evolution scenarios of this system combining migration\nprocesses and sudden perturbations. We model migration scenarios through\nnumerical integration of the gravitational N-body problem with additional\nnon-conservative forces. Planet-planet scattering has been investigated by\nN-body simulations.\n  We show that the present dynamical state of the system HD128311 may be\nexplained by such evolutionary processes.",

Our feedback model produces extended\nlow-metallicity cold gaseous discs around small galaxies. Since the space\ndensity of galaxies with low circular speeds is high, these discs dominate the\ncross-section for the identification of DLAs at all redshifts. The combined\neffects of star formation, outflows and infall in our models result in mild\nevolution of the N_{HI}-weighted metallicity content in DLAs with redshift,\nconsistent with observations. According to our model, DLAs contribute only a\nsmall fraction of the volume averaged star formation rate at redshifts z \\simlt\n5. Our model predicts weak evolution in Omega_{HI} over the redshift range\nz=0-5. Furthermore, we show that the cosmological evolution of Omega_{HI} and\nthe cosmic star formation rate are largely disconnected and conclude that the\nevolution of Omega_{HI} as a function of redshift is more likely to tell us\nabout feedback processes and the evolution of the outer gaseous components of\nsmall galaxies than about the cosmic history of star formation.",

    "summary": "We investigate transport of Cooper pairs through a double quantum dot (DQD)\nin the Kondo regime and coupled to superconducting leads. Within the\nnon-perturbative slave boson mean-field theory we evaluate the Josephson\ncurrent for two different configurations, the DQD coupled in parallel and in\nseries to the leads. We find striking differences between these configurations\nin the supercurrent as a function of the ratio t/\\Gamma, where t is the\ninterdot coupling and \\Gamma is the coupling to the leads: the critical current\nI_c decreases monotonously with t/\\Gamma for the parallel configuration whereas\nI_c exhibits a maximum at t/\\Gamma=1 in the serial case. These results\ndemonstrate that a variation of the ratio t/\\Gamma enables to control the flow\nof supercurrent through the Kondo resonance of the DQD.",

To this end, we compare line\nprofiles computed using relevant model chromospheres to profiles of the H-alpha\nand Ca II K lines observed in five red giant stars of the globular cluster NGC\n2808. The spectra were taken with FLAMES during Science Verification, using the\nUVES mode at high resolution (R=43,000) for the H-alpha line, and GIRAFFE in\nMEDUSA mode (R=20,000) for the Ca II K line. We find that the observed profiles\nare better described if a negative (outward) velocity field is included in the\nmodel chromospheres. This leads to mass loss rates of a few 10**(-9) solar\nmasses per year, very close to the requirements of the stellar evolution\ntheory.",

Specifically\nwe investigate the vacuum expectation values of the energy-momentum tensor and\nfermionic condensate admitting that the field obeys the MIT bag boundary\ncondition on two concentric spherical shells. In order to develop this\nanalysis, we use the generalized Abel-Plana summation, which allows to extract\nfrom the vacuum expectation values the contribution coming from a single sphere\ngeometry and to present the second sphere induced part in terms of\nexponentially convergent integrals. In the limit of strong gravitational field\ncorresponding to small values of the parameter describing the solid angle\ndeficit in global monopole geometry, the interference part in the expectation\nvalues are exponentially suppressed. The vacuum forces acting on spheres are\npresented as the sum of self-action and interaction terms. Due to the surface\ndivergences, the first one is divergent and needs additional renormalization,\nwhile the second one is finite for all non-zero distances between the spheres.\nBy making use of zeta function renormalization technique, the total Casimir\nenergy is evaluated in the region between two spheres. It is shown that the\ninteraction part of the vacuum energy is negative and the interaction forces\nbetween the spheres are attractive. Asymptotic expressions are derived in\nvarious limiting cases. As a special case we discuss the fermionic vacuum\ndensities for two spherical shells on background of the Minkowski spacetime.",

This scaling law is\ntested using existing and new measurements performed in water (subaqueous\nripples), in air (aeolian dunes and fresh snow dunes), in a high pressure\nCO$_2$ wind tunnel reproducing conditions close to the Venus atmosphere and in\nthe low pressure CO$_2$ martian atmosphere (martian dunes). A difficulty is to\ndetermine the diameter of saltating grains on Mars. A first estimate comes from\nphotographs of aeolian ripples taken by the rovers Opportunity and Spirit,\nshowing grains whose diameters are smaller than on Earth dunes. In addition we\ncalculate the effect of cohesion and viscosity on the dynamic and static\ntransport thresholds. It confirms that the small grains visualised by the\nrovers should be grains experiencing saltation. Finally, we show that, within\nerror bars, the scaling of $\\lambda$ with $L_{\\rm drag}$ holds over almost five\ndecades. We conclude with a discussion on the time scales and velocities at\nwhich these bed instabilities develop and propagate on Mars.",

    "summary": "We propose a mechanism for the low frequency electromagnetic emissions and\nother electromagnetic phenomena which have been associated with earthquakes.\nThe mechanism combines the critical earthquake concept and the concept of crust\nacting as a charging electric battery under increasing stress. The electric\ncharges are released by activation of dormant charge carriers in the oxygen\nanion sublattice, called peroxy bonds or positive hole pairs (PHP), where a PHP\nrepresents an $O_3X/^{OO}\\backslash YO_3$ with $X,Y = Si^{4+}, Al^{3+}...$,\ni.e. an $O^-$ in a matrix of $O^{2-}$ of silicates. We propose that PHP are\nactivated by plastic deformations during the slow cooperative build-up of\nstress and the increasingly correlated damage culminating in a large\n``critical'' earthquake. Recent laboratory experiments indeed show that\nstressed rocks form electric batteries which can release their charge when a\nconducting path closes the equivalent electric circuit. We conjecture that the\nintermittent and erratic occurrences of EM signals are a consequence of the\nprogressive build-up of the battery charges in the Earth crust and their\nerratic release when crack networks are percolating throughout the stressed\nrock volumes, providing a conductive pathway for the battery currents to\ndischarge. EM signals are thus expected close to the rupture, either slightly\nbefore or after, that is, when percolation is most favored.",

The photometric and spectroscopic\nmonitoring of SN 2004A show that it was a normal Type II-P which was discovered\nin NGC 6207 about two weeks after explosion. We compare SN 2004A to the similar\nType II-P SN 1999em and estimate an explosion epoch of 2004 January 6. We also\ncalculate three new distances to NGC 6207 of 21.0 +/-4.3, 21.4 +/-3.5 and 25.1\n+/-1.7Mpc. The former was calculated using the Standard Candle Method (SCM) for\nSNe II-P, and the latter two from the Brightest Supergiants Method (BSM). We\ncombine these three distances with existing kinematic distances, to derive a\nmean value of 20.3 +/-3.4Mpc. Using this distance we estimate that the ejected\nnickel mass in the explosion is 0.046(+0.031,-0.017) Msolar. The progenitor of\nSN 2004A is identified in pre-explosion WFPC2 F814W images with a magnitude of\nmF814W = 24.3 +/-0.3, but is below the detection limit of the F606W images. We\nshow that this was likely a red supergiant (RSG) with a mass of 9(+3,-2)\nMsolar. The object is detected at 4.7 sigma above the background noise. Even if\nthis detection is spurious, the 5 sigma upper limit would give a robust upper\nmass limit of 12 Msolar for a RSG progenitor. These initial masses are very\nsimilar to those of two previously identified RSG progenitors of the Type II-P\nSNe 2004gd 8(+4,-2) Msolar and 2005cs 9(+3,-2) Msolar).",

Inhomogeneous\nmodels are favoured to produce a single-peaked line profile.

    "summary": "We review the current state of our knowledge concerning the rotation and\nangular momentum evolution of young stellar objects and brown dwarfs from a\nprimarily observational view point. Periods are typically accurate to 1% and\navailable for about 1700 stars and 30 brown dwarfs in young clusters.\nDiscussion of angular momentum evolution also requires knowledge of stellar\nradii, which are poorly known for pre-main sequence stars. It is clear that\nrotation rates at a given age depend strongly on mass; higher mass stars\n(0.4-1.2 M$_\\odot$) have longer periods than lower mass stars and brown dwarfs.\nOn the other hand, specific angular momentum is approximately independent of\nmass for low mass pre-main sequence stars and young brown dwarfs. A spread of\nabout a factor of 30 is seen at any given mass and age. The evolution of\nrotation of solar-like stars during the first 100 Myr is discussed. A broad,\nbimodal distribution exists at the earliest observable phases ($\\sim$1 Myr) for\nstars more massive than 0.4 M$_\\odot$. The rapid rotators (50-60% of the\nsample) evolve to the ZAMS with little or no angular momentum loss. The slow\nrotators continue to lose substantial amounts of angular momentum for up to 5\nMyr, creating the even broader bimodal distribution characteristic of 30-120\nMyr old clusters. Accretion disk signatures are more prevalent among slowly\nrotating PMS stars, indicating a connection between accretion and rotation.\nDisks appear to influence rotation for, at most, $\\sim$5 Myr, and considerably\nless than that for the majority of stars. If the dense clusters studied so far\nare an accurate guide, then the typical solar-like star may have only $\\sim$1\nMyr for this task. It appears that both disk interactions and stellar winds are\nless efficient at braking these objects.",

Instead, most of the temperature\ndependence arises from the zeroth order term in the `expansion', through the\ntemperature dependence of the spectral function, and the interaction parameters\ncontained therein.

The equations for relative\nperturbations of ionization fractions were derived from the system of equations\nfor accurate computation of the ionization history of the early Universe given\nby Seager et al. (1999,2000). It is shown that strong dependence of ionization\nand recombination rates on the density and temperature of plasma provides the\nsignificant deviations of amplitudes of ionization fractions relative\nperturbations from ones of baryon matter density adiabatic perturbations. Such\ndeviations are most prominent for cosmological adiabatic perturbations of\nscales larger than sound horizon at recombination epoch. The amplitudes of\nrelative perturbations of number densities of electrons and protons at last\nscattering surface exceed by factor of $\\simeq$5 the amplitude of relative\nperturbation of baryons total number density, for helium ions this ratio\nreaches the value of $\\simeq$18. For subhorizon cosmological perturbations\nthese ratios appear to be essentially lesser and depend on oscillation phase at\nthe moment of decoupling. These perturbations of number densities of ions and\nelectrons at recombination epoch do not contribute to the intrinsic plasma\ntemperature fluctuations but cause the ''corrugation'' of last scattering\nsurface in optical depth, $\\delta z_{dec}/(z_{dec}+1)\\approx -\\delta_b/3$, at\nscales larger than sound horizon.

Interpretive and predictive computational\ncapability in this area is assisted by the development of Vlasov codes, which\noffer high velocity space resolution in high energy regions of particle phase\nspace, and do not require analytical pre-processing of the fundamental\nequations. A direct Vlasov solver, capable of resolving these kinetic\nprocesses, is used here to address fundamental aspects of the existence and\nstability of the electron acoustic wave, together with its collective\nscattering properties. These simulations are extended to realistic laser and\nplasma parameters characteristic of single hot-spot experiments. Results are in\nqualitative agreement with experiments displaying both stimulated Raman and\nstimulated electron acoustic scattering. The amplitude of simulated EAWs is\ngreater than that observed experimentally, and is accompanied by a higher phase\nvelocity.

    "summary": "Indices of vector fields on (complex analytic) singular varieties have been\nconsidered by various authors from several different viewpoints. All these\nindices coincide with the classical local index of Poincar\\'e-Hopf when the\nambient variety is a smooth manifold. One has the Schwartz index, the local\nEuler obstruction, the GSV-index, the virtual index and the homological index\n(and probably other indices too). In this article we give a brief overview of\nall these indices and the relations amongst them. We also indicate their\nrelations with the various generalisations to complex analytic singular\nvarieties of the Chern classes of complex manifolds.",

    "summary": "To understand the origin of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs, defined to\nbe above 10^18 eV), it is required to model in a realistic way their\npropagation in the Universe. UHECRs can interact with low energy radio,\nmicrowave, infrared and optical photons to produce electron/positron pairs or\npions. The latter decay and give rise to neutrinos and electromagnetic cascades\nextending down to MeV energies. In addition, deflections in cosmic magnetic\nfields can influence the spectrum and sky distribution of primary cosmic rays\nand, due to the increased propagation path length, the secondary neutrino and\ngamma-ray fluxes. Neutrino, gamma-ray, cosmic ray physics and extra-galactic\nmagnetic fields are, therefore, strongly linked subjects and should be\nconsidered together in order to extract maximal information from existing and\nfuture data, like the one expected from the Auger Observatory. For that\npurpose, we have developed CRPropa, a publicly-available numerical package\nwhich takes into account interactions and deflections of primary UHECRs as well\nas propagation of secondary electromagnetic cascades and neutrinos. CRPropa\nallows to compute the observable properties of UHECRs and their secondaries in\na variety of models for the sources and propagation of these particles. Here we\npresent physical processes taken into account as well as benchmark examples; a\ndetailed documentation of the code can be found on our web site.",

We calculate the phase offset as a function of baseline length\nfor an Earth-like planet around the Sun at 10 pc, with a contrast ratio of\n$10^{-6}$ at 10 $\\mu$m. The magnitude of the phase due to the planet is $\\sim\n10^{-6}$ radians, assuming the star is at the phase center of the array.\nAlthough this is small, this phase may be observable in a three-telescope\nnulling interferometer that measures the closure phase. We propose a simple\nnon-redundant three-telescope nulling interferometer that can perform this\nmeasurement. This configuration is expected to have improved characteristics\ncompared to other nulling interferometer concepts, such as a relaxation of\npathlength tolerances, through the use of the \"ratio of wavelengths\" technique,\na closure phase, and better discrimination between exodiacal dust and planets.",

    "summary": "Aging in an attraction-driven colloidal glass is studied by computer\nsimulations. The system is equilibrated without attraction and instantaneously\n``quenched'', at constant colloid volume fraction, to one of two states beyond\nthe glass transition; one is close to the transition, and the other one deep in\nthe glass. The evolution of structural properties shows that bonds form in the\nsystem, increasing the local density, creating density deficits (holes)\nelsewhere. This process slows down with the time elapsed since the quench. As a\nconsequence of bond formation, there is a slowing down of the dynamics, as\nmeasured by the mean squared displacement and the density, bond, and\nenvironment correlation functions. The density correlations can be\ntime-rescaled to collapse their long time (structural) decay. The time scale\nfor structural relaxation shows for both quenches a super-linear dependence on\nwaiting time; it grows faster than the bond lifetime, showing the collective\norigin of the transition. At long waiting times and high attraction strength,\nwe observe {\\rem completely} arrested dynamics for more than three decades in\ntime, although individual bonds are not permanent on this time scale. The\nlocalization length decreases as the state moves deeper in the glass; the\nnon-ergodicity parameter oscillates in phase with the structure factor. Our\nmain results are obtained for systems with a barrier in the pair potential that\ninhibits phase separation. However, when this barrier is removed for the case\nof a deep quench, we find changes in the static structure but almost none in\nthe dynamics. Hence our results for the aging behavior remain relevant to\nexperiments in which the glass transition competes with phase separation.",

    "summary": "We evaluate the LHC discovery potential for a light Higgs boson in t tbar H\n(-> l nu b bbar b bbar jj) production, within the Standard Model and if a new\nQ=2/3 quark singlet T with a moderate mass exists. In the latter case, T pair\nproduction with decays T Tbar -> W+ b H tbar / H t W- bbar -> W+ b W- bbar H\nprovides an important additional source of Higgs bosons giving the same\nexperimental signature, and other decay modes T Tbar -> H t H tbar -> W+ b W-\nbbar H H, T Tbar -> Z t H tbar / H t Z tbar -> W+ b W- bbar H Z further enhance\nthis signal. Both analyses are carried out with particle-level simulations of\nsignals and backgrounds, including t tbar plus n=0...5 jets which constitute\nthe main background by far. Our estimate for SM Higgs discovery in t tbar H\nproduction, 0.4 sigma significance for M_H = 115 GeV and an integrated\nluminosity of 30 fb^-1, is similar to the most recent ones by CMS which also\ninclude the full t tbar nj background. We show that, if a quark singlet with a\nmass m_T = 500 GeV exists, the luminosity required for Higgs discovery in this\nfinal state is reduced by more than two orders of magnitude, and 5 sigma\nsignificance can be achieved already with 8 fb^-1. This new Higgs signal will\nnot be seen unless we look for it: with this aim, a new specific final state\nreconstruction method is presented. Finally, we consider the sensitivity to\nsearch for Q=2/3 singlets. The combination of these three decay modes allows to\ndiscover a 500 GeV quark with 7 fb^-1 of luminosity.",

Both $J(t)$ and\n$G_e(\\omega)$ exhibit power law behavior: $J(t)= A(t/t_0)^\\alpha$ and $\\bar\nG_e(\\omega)\\bar = G_0 (\\omega/\\omega_0)^\\alpha$, with the same exponent\n$\\alpha\\approx 0.2$. This power law behavior is very robust ; $\\alpha$ is\ndistributed over a narrow range, and shows almost no dependance on the cell\ntype, on the nature of the protein complex which transmits the mechanical\nstress, nor on the typical length scale of the experiment. On the contrary, the\nprefactors $A_0$ and $G_0$appear very sensitive to these parameters. Whereas\nthe exponents $\\alpha$ are normally distributed over the cell population, the\nprefactors $A_0$ and $G_0$ follow a log-normal repartition. These results are\ncompared with other data published in the litterature. We propose a global\ninterpretation, based on a semi-phenomenological model, which involves a broad\ndistribution of relaxation times in the system. The model predicts the power\nlaw behavior and the statistical repartition of the mechanical parameters, as\nexperimentally observed for the cells.

    "summary": "We have carried out Very Large Array (VLA) continuum observations to study\nthe variability of Sgr A* at 43 GHz ($\\lambda$=7mm) and 22 GHz\n($\\lambda$=13mm). A low level of flare activity has been detected with a\nduration of $\\sim$ 2 hours at these frequencies, showing the peak flare\nemission at 43 GHz leading the 22 GHz peak flare by $\\sim20$ to 40 minutes. The\noverall characteristics of the flare emission are interpreted in terms of the\nplasmon model of Van der Laan (1966) by considering the ejection and\nadiabatically expansion of a uniform, spherical plasma blob due to flare\nactivity. The observed peak of the flare emission with a spectral index\n$\\nu^{-\\alpha}$ of $\\alpha$=1.6 is consistent with the prediction that the peak\nemission shifts toward lower frequencies in an adiabatically-expanding\nself-absorbed source. We present the expected synchrotron light curves for an\nexpanding blob as well as the peak frequency emission as a function of the\nenergy spectral index constrained by the available flaring measurements in\nnear-IR, sub-millimeter, millimeter and radio wavelengths. We note that the\nblob model is consistent with the available measurements, however, we can not\nrule out the jet of Sgr A*. If expanding material leaves the gravitational\npotential of Sgr A*, the total mass-loss rate of nonthermal and thermal\nparticles is estimated to be $\\le 2\\times10^{-8}$ M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. We\ndiscuss the implication of the mass-loss rate since this value matches closely\nwith the estimated accretion rate based on polarization measurements.",

For the perfectly entangled state the z component, M,\nof the magnetization of the whole system is equal to zero. The errors lead to a\nfinite value of M. If the number of qubits in the system is large, M can be\ndetected experimentally. Using the fact that M depends differently on the\nparameters of the system for each kind of error, varying these parameters would\nallow one to experimentally determine the most significant source of errors and\nto optimize correspondingly the quantum computer design in order to decrease\nthe errors and M. Using our approach one can benchmark the quantum computer,\ndecrease the errors, and prepare the quantum computer for implementation of\nmore complex quantum algorithms.",

    "summary": "In this paper, we propose a general approach for describing hadronic B\ndecays. Using this method, all amplitudes for such decays can be expressed in\nterms of contractions, though the matrix elements are not evaluated. Many years\nago, Buras and Silvestrini proposed a similar approach. However, our technique\ngoes beyond theirs in several ways. First, we include recent theoretical and\nexperimental developments which indicate which contractions are negligible, and\nwhich are expected to be smaller than others. Second, we show that all B-decay\ndiagrams can be simply expressed in terms of contractions. This constitutes a\nformal proof that the diagrammatic method is rigourous. Third, we show that one\nreproduces the relations between tree and electroweak-penguin diagrams\ndescribed by Neubert and Rosner, and by Gronau, Pirjol and Yan. Fourth,\nalthough the previous results hold to all orders in alpha_s, we show that it is\nalso possible to work order-by-order in this approach. In this way it is\npossible to make a connection with the matrix-element evaluation methods of QCD\nfactorization (QCDfac) and perturbative QCD (pQCD). Finally, using the\ncontractions approach, we re-evaluate the question of whether there is a ``B ->\npi K puzzle.'' At O(alpha_s^0), we find that the diagram ratio |C'/T| is about\n0.17, a factor of 10 too small to explain all the B -> pi K data. Both QCDfac\nand pQCD find that, at O(\\alpha_s^1), the value of |C'/T'| may be raised to\nonly about 2-3 times its lowest-order value. We therefore conclude that,\nassuming the effect is not a statistical fluctuation, it is likely that the\nvalue of |C'/T'| is similar to its O(\\alpha_s^0) result, and that there really\nis a B -> pi K puzzle.",

    "summary": "To further our understanding of the Great Attractor (GA), we have undertaken\na redshift survey using the 2dF on the AAT. Clusters and filaments in the GA\nregion were targeted with 25 separate pointings resulting in approximately 2600\nnew redshifts. Targets included poorly studied X-ray clusters from the CIZA\ncatalogue as well as the Cen-Crux and PKS 1343-601 clusters, both of which lie\nclose to the classic GA centre. For nine clusters in the region, we report\nvelocity distributions as well as virial and projected mass estimates. The\nvirial mass of CIZA J1324.7-5736, now identified as a separate structure from\nthe Cen-Crux cluster, is found to be ~3x10^14 M_sun, in good agreement with the\nX-ray inferred mass. In the PKS 1343-601 field, five redshifts are measured of\nwhich four are new. An analysis of redshifts from this survey, in combination\nwith those from the literature, reveals the dominant structure in the GA region\nto be a large filament, which appears to extend from Abell S0639 (l=281\\deg,\nb=+11\\deg) to (l~5\\deg, b~-50\\deg), encompassing the Cen-Crux, CIZA\nJ1324.7-5736, Norma and Pavo II clusters. Behind the Norma Cluster at cz~15000\nkm/s, the masses of four rich clusters are calculated. These clusters\n(Triangulum-Australis, Ara, CIZA J1514.6-4558 and CIZA J1410.4-4246) may\ncontribute to a continued large-scale flow beyond the GA. The results of these\nobservations will be incorporated into a subsequent analysis of the GA flow.",

The change of the\npolarizability of the donor-acceptor complex in the course of electronic\ntransition couples to the reaction field of the polar environment and the\nelectric field created by the macroscopic polarization. An analytical theory\ndeveloped to describe this situation predicts a significant asymmetry of the\nreorganization energy between charge separation and charge recombination\ntransitions. This result is proved by Monte Carlo simulations of a model\npolarizable diatomic dissolved in a ferroelectric fluid of soft dipolar\nspheres. The ratio of the reorganization energies for the forward and backward\nreactions up to a factor of 25 is obtained in the simulations. This result, as\nwell as the effect of the macroscopic electric field, is discussed in\napplication to the design of efficient photosynthetic devices.",

We propose a scheme where the received wireless\nsignal at each interface is quantized and sent over the fiber. Though our\narchitecture is similar to that of the classical CEO problem, our problem is\ndifferent from it. We show that the capacity of our scheme approaches the\ncapacity of the architecture, exponentially with fiber capacity. We also show\nthat for a given fiber capacity, there is an optimal operating wireless\nbandwidth and an optimal number of wireless-optical interfaces. The\nwireless-optical interfaces of our scheme have low complexity and do not\nrequire knowledge of the transmitter code book. They are also extendable to\nFAWNAs with large number of transmitters and interfaces and, offer adaptability\nto variable rates, changing channel conditions and node positions.",

Because many concepts, such as\ncomplete distributivity, in lattice theory can be characterized by existence of\ncertain adjunctions, they can be reformulated in the many-valued setting in\nterms of categorical postulations. So, it is possible, by aid of categorical\nmachineries, to establish theories of many-valued complete lattices,\nmany-valued completely distributive lattices, and so on. This paper presents a\nsystematical investigation of many-valued complete distributivity, including\nthe topics: (1) subalgebras and quotient algebras of many-valued completely\ndistributive lattices; (2) categories of (left adjoint) functors; and (3) the\nrelationship between many-valued complete distributivity and properties of the\nquantale of truth values.

The new data set includes JLab,\nHERMES, and COMPASS measurements on spin asymmetry A_1 for the neutron and\ndeuteron in lepton scattering. Our new analysis also utilizes the double-spin\nasymmetry for pi^0 production in polarized pp collisions, A_{LL}^{pi^0},\nmeasured by the PHENIX collaboration. Because of these new data, uncertainties\nof the polarized PDFs are reduced. In particular, the JLab, HERMES, and COMPASS\nmeasurements are valuable for determining Delta d_v(x) at large x and Delta\nqbar(x) at x~0.1. The PHENIX pi^0 data significantly reduce the uncertainty of\nDelta g(x). Furthermore, we discuss a possible constraint on Delta g(x) at\nlarge x by using the HERMES data on g_1^d in comparison with the COMPASS ones\nat x~0.05.",

The B-band mass-to-light ratios of all three galaxies\nare rather similar, (M/L)_B = 3-4. Within the inner two half-light radii, about\n40-50% of the mass is in the form of dark matter, so dEs contain about as much\ndark matter as bright ellipticals.\n  NGC205 and NGC147 have a relatively isotropic velocity dispersion tensor\nwithin the region where the internal dynamics are strongly constrained by the\ndata. Our estimated inclination for NGC185 is i ~ 50 degrees because in that\ncase the model has an intrinsic flattening close to the peak of the intrinsic\nshape distribution of dEs and it, like the best fitting models for NGC147 and\nNGC205, is nearly isotropic. We also show that the dynamical properties of the\nbright nucleus of NGC205 are not unlike those of a massive globular cluster.",

    "summary": "A large amount of work has been dedicated to studying general relativity\ncoupled to non-Abelian Yang-Mills type theories. It has been shown that the\nmagnetic monopole, a solution of the Yang-Mills-Higgs equations can be coupled\nto gravitation. For a low Higgs mass there are regular solutions, and for a\nsufficiently massive monopole the system develops an extremal magnetic\nReissner-Nordstrom quasi-horizon. These solutions, called quasi-black holes,\nalthough non-singular, are arbitrarily close to having a horizon. However, at\nthe critical value the quasi-black hole turns into a degenerate spacetime. On\nthe other hand, for a high Higgs mass, a sufficiently massive monopole develops\nalso a quasi-black hole, but it turns into an extremal true horizon, with\nmatter fields outside. One can also put a small Schwarzschild black hole inside\nthe magnetic monopole, an example of a non-Abelian black hole. Surprisingly,\nMajumdar-Papapetrou systems, Abelian systems constructed from extremal dust,\nalso show a resembling behavior. Previously, we have reported that one can find\nMajumdar-Papapetrou solutions which can be arbitrarily close of being a black\nhole, displaying quasi-black hole behavior. With the aim of better\nunderstanding the similarities between gravitational monopoles and\nMajumdar-Papapetrou systems, we study a system composed of two extremal\nelectrically charged spherical shells (or stars, generically) in the\nEinstein--Maxwell--Majumdar-Papapetrou theory. We review the gravitational\nproperties of the monopoles, and compare with the properties of the double\nextremal electric shell system. These quasi-black holes can help in the\nunderstanding of true black holes, and can give insight into the nature of the\nentropy of black holes in the form of entanglement.",

However,\nintegrating a priori knowledge of the gene networks could help in the\nstatistical analysis of gene expression data and in their biological\ninterpretation. Here we propose a method to integrate a priori the knowledge of\na gene network in the analysis of gene expression data. The approach is based\non the spectral decomposition of gene expression profiles with respect to the\neigenfunctions of the graph, resulting in an attenuation of the high-frequency\ncomponents of the expression profiles with respect to the topology of the\ngraph. We show how to derive unsupervised and supervised classification\nalgorithms of expression profiles, resulting in classifiers with biological\nrelevance. We applied the method to the analysis of a set of expression\nprofiles from irradiated and non-irradiated yeast strains. It performed at\nleast as well as the usual classification but provides much more biologically\nrelevant results and allows a direct biological interpretation.",

We show where and how low-lying strength begins to appear as\nN increases. We also exhibit partial energy-weighted sums of the transition\nstrength as functions of N for all nuclei calculated, and transition densities\nfor many of the interesting peaks. We find that low-energy strength increases\nwith N in all multipoles, but with distinctive features in each. The low-lying\n0+ strength near the neutron at large N barely involves protons at all, with\nthe strength coming primarily from a single two-quasineutron configuration with\nvery large spatial extent. The low-lying 1- strength is different, with protons\ncontributing to the transition density in the nuclear interior together with\nneutrons at large radii. The low-lying 2+ transition strength goes largely to\nmore localized states. The three Skyrme interactions we test produce similar\nresults, differing most significantly in their predictions for the location of\nthe neutron drip line, the boundaries of deformed regions, energies of and\ntransition strengths to the lowest 2+ states between closed shells, and\nisovector energy-weighted sum rules.",

In the case of the M2\nsupergiant mu Cephei, several sets of data, both spectra and visibilities,\nstrongly suggested the presence of an extra-molecular layer, and its basic\nparameters are estimated to be: excitation temperature T_ex = 1600 K, column\ndensities of CO and H2O N_col = 3.0d+20/cm2, and inner radius R_in = 2.0R*. The\nresult shows reasonable agreement with the one based on the infrared spectra\nalone, and this may be because the infrared spectra already include some\ninformation on the spatial structure of the outer atmosphere. It is important,\nhowever, that the model inferred from the spectra is now fully supported with\nthe recent visibility data. In the case of the M2 supergiant alpha Orionis, the\ninfrared spectra and visibilities show a consistent picture in that its\nmolecular layer is closer to the photosphere (R_in = 1.3R*) with higher gas\ntemperature (T_ex = 2250 K) and lower gas column density (N_col = 1.0d+20/cm2),\ncompared with that of mu Cephei.

In this paper we discuss the derived\nrequirements applying to the temperature sensing system, and address the\nproblem of how to create in the laboratory a thermally quiet environment,\nsuitable to perform meaningful on-ground tests of the system. The concept is a\ntwo layer spherical body, with a central aluminium core for sensor implantation\nsurrounded by a layer of polyurethane. We construct the insulator transfer\nfunction, which relates the temperature at the core with the laboratory ambient\ntemperature, and evaluate the losses caused by heat leakage through connecting\nwires.

We\nalso test that the relations among these parameters agree with observations.\nTaking into account these results, the hierarchical growth of the structure\npredicts a bulge formation scenario for typical field spiral galaxies where\nsecular evolution during dissipate mergers plays a fundamental role.\nConversely, subsequent mergers can help to enlarge the bulges but do not seem\nto strongly modify their fundamental mass relations. Systems get to the local\nmass relations at different stages of evolution (i.e. different redshifts) so\nthat their formation histories introduce a natural scatter in the relations.\nOur results suggest that the formation mechanisms of the bulge and disc\ncomponents, satisfying their corresponding fundamental mass relations, might be\ncoupled and that secular evolution could be the possible connecting process.",

Until\nrecently, that prognosis has been considered solely within the framework of the\nso-called \"standard model of solar system formation\", which is incorrect and\nleads to the contradiction of terrestrial planets having insufficiently massive\ncores. By contrast, that prognosis is considerably enhanced (i) by the new\nvision I have disclosed of Earth formation as a Jupiter-like gas giant; (ii) by\ncore formation contemporaneous with raining out from within a giant gaseous\nprotoplanet rather than through subsequent whole-Earth re-melting after loss of\ngases; (iii) by the consequences of whole-Earth decompression dynamics, which\nobviates the unfounded assumption of mantle convection, and; (iv) by the\nprocess of mantle decompression thermal-tsunami. The latter, in addition to\naccounting for much of the heat leaving the Earth's surface, for the geothermal\ngradient observed in the crust, for substantial volcanism, and possibly for\nearthquake generation as well, also might enhance the prognosis for future\nabiotic energy supplies by pressurizing and heating the base of the crust, a\npotential collection point for abiotic mantle methane or other mantle-derived\ncarbon-containing matter.",

In this\nscenario, we present a theoretical criterion to determine the boundaries of\ngravitationally bound structures and a physically motivated definition of\nsuperclusters as the largest bound structures in the Universe. We use the\nspherical collapse model self-consistently to obtain an analytical condition\nfor the mean density enclosed by the last bound shell of the structure (2.36\ntimes the critical density in the present Universe, assumed to be flat, with 30\nper cent matter and 70 per cent cosmological constant, in agreement with the\nprevious, numerical result of Chiueh and He). $N$-body simulations extended to\nthe future show that this criterion, applied at the present cosmological epoch,\ndefines a sphere that encloses $\\approx 99.7$ per cent of the particles that\nwill remain bound to the structure at least until the scale parameter of the\nUniverse is 100 times its present value. On the other hand, $(28\\pm 13)$ per\ncent of the enclosed particles are in fact not bound, so the enclosed mass\noverestimates the bound mass, in contrast with the previous, less rigorous\ncriterion of, e.~g., Busha and collaborators, which gave a more precise mass\nestimate. We also verify that the spherical collapse model estimate for the\nradial infall velocity of a shell enclosing a given mean density gives an\naccurate prediction for the velocity profile of infalling particles, down to\nvery near the centre of the virialized core.",

It is\nwell-known that in a spin-1 BEC in a quadrupole trap a doubly quantized vortex\nis produced topologically by a ``slow'' reversal of bias magnetic field $B_z$.\nWe find that in the magnetic trap considered it is also possible to produce a\n4- and 1-quantized vortex in a spin-1 BEC. The latter is possible, for example,\nduring the magnetic field switching-off process. We therefore provide a\npossible explanation for the unexpected interference patterns in the\nexperiment.

Secondly, the RSLs are weakly\ncorrelated with $FWHM$, asymmetry, peak flux ($F_{p}$), peak energy ($E_{p}$)\nand spectral indexes ($\\alpha$ and $\\beta$), while they are uncorrelated with\n$\\tau_{31}$, hardness-ratio ($HR_{31}$) and peak time ($t_m$).

    "summary": "Developing a theory of low-mass star formation ($\\sim 0.1$ to 3~M$_{\\odot}$)\nremains one of the most elusive and important goals of theoretical\nastrophysics. The star-formation process is the outcome of the complex dynamics\nof interstellar gas involving non-linear interactions of turbulence, gravity,\nmagnetic field and radiation. The evolution of protostellar condensations, from\nthe moment they are assembled by turbulent flows to the time they reach stellar\ndensities, spans an enormous range of scales, resulting in a major\ncomputational challenge for simulations. Since the previous Protostars and\nPlanets conference, dramatic advances in the development of new numerical\nalgorithmic techniques have been successfully implemented on large scale\nparallel supercomputers. Among such techniques, Adaptive Mesh Refinement and\nSmooth Particle Hydrodynamics have provided frameworks to simulate the process\nof low-mass star formation with a very large dynamic range. It is now feasible\nto explore the turbulent fragmentation of molecular clouds and the\ngravitational collapse of cores into stars self-consistently within the same\ncalculation. The increased sophistication of these powerful methods comes with\nsubstantial caveats associated with the use of the techniques and the\ninterpretation of the numerical results. In this review, we examine what has\nbeen accomplished in the field and present a critique of both numerical methods\nand scientific results. We stress that computational simulations should obey\nthe available observational constraints and demonstrate numerical convergence.\nFailing this, results of numerical simulations do not advance our understanding\nof low-mass star formation.",

Two different annealing treatments of the solid\nsolution, in pure oxygen and in pure argon, allowed also to study the effect of\nthe oxygen content variation. Structure and electronic properties of the\nsamples have been investigated by means of X-ray powder diffraction and X-ray\nabsorption spectroscopy measurements. Magnetoresistivity and static\nmagnetization measurements have been carried out to complete the samples\ncharacterization. Oxygen annealing of the solid solution, that showed a limit\nfor about y=0.5, induces an increase of the Mn average valence state and a\ntransition of the crystal structure from tetragonal to orthorhombic while the\nargon annealing induces an oxygen under-stoichiometry and, in turn, a reduction\nof the Mn average valence state. Along with the Ca substitution, the\nJahn-Teller distortion of the MnO6 octahedra is reduced. This has been directly\nconnected to a general enhancement of the transport properties induced by the\nCa-doping. For the same cation composition, oxygen over-stoichiometry leads to\nhigher metal-insulator transition temperatures and lower resistivity values.\nCurie temperatures (TC) reduce by increasing the Ca-doping. The lower TC for\nall the annealed samples with respect to the 'as prepared' ones are connected\nto the strong influence on the magnetic interaction of the point defects due to\nthe oxygen content variation.",

Eighteen of\nour sources are very luminous with a typical, absorption-corrected 2-10 keV\nluminosity of few 10^{44} erg/sec (type-II QSOs). We compare the emission line\nproperties of the new sources with emission line and X-ray luminosities of\nknown low redshift, mostly lower luminosity AGNs by using a composite spectrum.\nWe find that ${\\rm L_{[OIII]}}$/${\\rm L_{2-10}}$ and ${\\rm L_{[OII]}}$/${\\rm\nL_{2-10}}$ decrease with L(2-10 keV) such that ${\\rm L_{[OIII]}}/{\\rm L_{2-10}}\n\\propto {\\rm L_{2-10}}^{-0.42}$. The trend was already evident, yet neglected\nin past low redshift samples. This lead to erroneous calibration of the\nline-to-X-ray luminosity in earlier AGN samples. The analysis of several type-I\nsamples shows the same trend with a similar slope but a median ${\\rm\nL_{[OIII]}}$/${\\rm L_{2-10}}$ which is larger by a factor of about two compared\nwith optically selected type-II samples. We interpret this shift as due to\nadditional reddening in type-II sources and comment in general on the very\nlarge extinction in many type-II objects and the significantly smaller average\nreddening of the SDSS type-II AGNs. The decrease of ${\\rm L_{[OIII]}}$/${\\rm\nL_{2-10}}$ with L(2--10 keV) is large enough to suggest that a significant\nfraction of high luminosity high redshift type-II AGNs have very weak emission\nlines that may have escaped detection in large samples. A related decrease of\nEW([OIII]) with optical continuum luminosity is demonstrated by an analysis of\n12,000 type-I SDSS AGNs.",

We have defined the density of the local environment\nfor each galaxy using a method which takes account of the redshift bias\nintroduced by survey boundaries if traditional methods are used. At\nluminosities greater than our absolute r-band magnitude cutoff of -20.45 the\nmean density of environment shows no trend with redshift. We calculate the Lick\nindices for the entire sample and correct for aperture effects and velocity\ndispersion in a model independent way. Although we find no dependence of\nredshift or luminosity with environment we do find that the mean velocity\ndispersion, sigma, of early-type galaxies in dense environments tends to be\nhigher than in low density environments. Taking account of this effect we find\nthat several indices show small but very significant trends with environment\nthat are not the result of the correlation between indices and velocity\ndispersion. The statistical significance of the data is sufficiently high to\nreveal that models accounting only for alpha-enhancement struggle to produce a\nconsistent picture of age and metallicity of the sample galaxies, whereas a\nmodel that also includes carbon enhancement fares much better. We find that\nearly-type galaxies in the field are younger than those in environments typical\nof clusters but that neither metallicity, alpha-enhancement nor carbon\nenhancement are influenced by the environment. The youngest early-type galaxies\nin both field and cluster environments are those with the lowest sigma.\nHowever, there is some evidence that the objects with the largest sigma are\nslightly younger, especially in denser environments.",

We test these amplitudes in different reactions like\n$K^-p\\to\\Lambda\\pi\\pi$, $\\gamma p\\to K^+K^-p$, $\\gamma p\\to\nK^+\\pi^0\\pi^0\\Lambda$ and $\\pi^- p\\to K^0 K^-p$ and find a fair agreement with\nthe experimental data.",

These observations are\namong the highest angular resolutions obtained below 1000 MHz for this object.\nWhile the angular resolution at 74 MHz is not sufficient to separate clearly\nthe hot spots from the lobes, guided by 151 and 327 MHz images, we have\nestimated the 74 MHz emission from the hot spots. We confirm that the emission\nfrom both the western and eastern hot spots flattens at low frequencies and\nthat there is a spectral asymmetry between the two. For the eastern hot spot, a\nlow-energy cutoff in the electron energy spectrum appears to explain the\nflattening, which implies a cutoff Lorentz factor \\gamma_min ~ 300, though we\ncannot exclude the possibility that there might be a moderate level of\nfree-free absorption. For the western hot spot, the current observations are\nnot sufficient to distinguish between a free-free absorped power-law spectrum\nand a synchrotron self-absorbed spectrum.",

In this paper, a t-matrix formalism is used to study\nthe effect of such correlated weak springs in a scalar model on a simple cubic\nlattice with a binary distribution of spring constants. Our results, which are\nconfirmed by computer simulations, show that a concentration of c oscillators\nwith z weak springs and 6-z strong ones leads to a low frequency peak in the\nreduced density of states (Boson peak) even when the total concentration of\nweak springs cz is less than 10%., No such peak has been found at these low\nconcentrations in previously reported calculations which used effective medium\nmethods. For a given value of cz, this peak becomes more pronounced and moves\nto much lower frequencies as z increases.",

An interpretation of the structure involving a dark energy\nmass distribution that is twice the usual value is shown to clarify greatly the\nphysical significance of the mathematics.

This mass component is identified\nwith the dark energy content of the universe that has been postulated to\nexplain the observed acceleration.

    "summary": "Free interpolation in Hardy spaces is caracterized by the well-known Carleson\ncondition. The result extends to Hardy-Orlicz spaces contained in the scale of\nclassical Hardy spaces $H^p$, $p>0$. For the Smirnov and the Nevanlinna\nclasses, interpolating sequences have been characterized in a recent paper in\nterms of the existence of harmonic majorants (quasi-bounded in the case of the\nSmirnov class). Since the Smirnov class can be regarded as the union over all\nHardy-Orlicz spaces associated with a so-called strongly convex function, it is\nnatural to ask how the condition changes from the Carleson condition in\nclassical Hardy spaces to harmonic majorants in the Smirnov class. The aim of\nthis paper is to narrow down this gap from the Smirnov class to ``big''\nHardy-Orlicz spaces. More precisely, we characterize interpolating sequences\nfor a class of Hardy-Orlicz spaces that carry an algebraic structure and that\nare strictly bigger than $\\bigcup_{p>0} H^p$. It turns out that the\ninterpolating sequences are again characterized by the existence of\nquasi-bounded majorants, but now the weights of the majorants have to be in\nsuitable Orlicz spaces. The existence of harmonic majorants in such Orlicz\nspaces will also be discussed in the general situation. We finish the paper\nwith an example of a separated Blaschke sequence that is interpolating for\ncertain Hardy-Orlicz spaces without being interpolating for slightly smaller\nones.",

This is in\naccord with our earlier finding that such ultrarelativistic (Lorentz factor,\nGamma > 30) conical jets can reconcile the relatively slow apparent motions of\nVLBI knots in TeV blazars with the extremely fast flows implied by their rapid\ngamma-ray variability. This jet geometry also implies that de-projected jet\nopening angles will typically be significantly underestimated from VLBI\nmeasurements. In addition, de-projected jet lengths will be considerably\noverestimated if high Lorentz factors and significant opening angles are not\ntaken into account.",

    "summary": "We first review some basic properties of the most important classes of active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN), including quasars, blazars, Seyfert galaxies and radio\ngalaxies. The most commonly accepted type of scheme designed to individually\nunify the radio-loud and radio-quiet categories of AGN is based upon three\nparameters: black hole mass, accretion rate, and our orientation to the\naccretion flow. Some recent evidence from optical microvariability of several\nclasses of AGN points in favor of a strong unification scheme that unites both\nradio-loud and radio-quiet categories. An important question concerning the\nnature of blazars and other AGN whose jet emission appears to dominate their\nspectral energy distributions involves the velocities of those flows. A variety\nof apparently contradictory observations can be reconciled if such flows are\nultrarelativistic but have an opening angle of a few degrees. Radio galaxies\n(RGs) were much more numerous at redshifts ~2 than they are today. Combining\nthis fact with the realization that older RGs at such redshifts are very\ndifficult to detect, and with cosmological simulations of the growth of\nstructure in the universe has led us to propose that RG lobes have impacted a\nsignificant fraction of the cosmic web of baryons. These impacts may have\ntriggered extensive star formation and perhaps even engendered new galaxies;\nthey also probably played important roles in the spreading of magnetic fields\nand heavier elements into the intergalactic medium.",

The data are drawn from the NOAO\nFundamental Plane Survey. Our adopted method is a generalization of that\nintroduced by Nelan et al. to determine the global age-mass and\nmetallicity-mass relations from the same survey. We find strong evidence for a\nchange in galaxy properties, at fixed mass, over a range from the cluster\ncentre to the virial radius, R_200. For example, red-sequence galaxies further\nout in the clusters have weaker Mgb5177 (at ~8 sigma significance) and stronger\nHbeta and Hgamma absorption (~3 sigma, ~4 sigma) than galaxies of the same\nvelocity dispersion in the cluster cores. The Fe5270 and Fe5335 indices show\nonly very weak trends with radius. Using a total of twelve indices, the pattern\nof cluster-centric gradients is considered in light of their different\ndependences on stellar age and chemical composition. The measured gradients for\nall twelve indices can be reproduced by a model in which red-sequence galaxies\nat ~1 R_200 have on average younger ages (by 15+/-4%) and lower alpha-element\nabundance ratios (by 10+/-2%), than galaxies of the same velocity dispersion\nbut located near the cluster centre. For the total metallicity, Z/H, no\nsignificant gradient is found (2+/-3% larger at R_200 than in the core). The\ncluster-centric age and alpha/Fe gradients are in the sense expected if\ngalaxies in the cluster core were accreted at an earlier epoch than those at\nlarger radii, and if this earlier accretion contributed to an earlier cessation\nof star formation. The size of the observed age trend is comparable to\npredictions from semi-analytic models of hierarchical galaxy formation.",

The radio emission of the jet is used as a tracer for the\naccretion rate and is normalised using sources of known accretion rates: island\nstate neutron stars and efficiently radiating black holes close to a state\ntransition. We show that the radio power in black holes and neutron stars is\ncomparable for a given mass accretion rate and verify empirically the assumed\nanalytic scaling of the radio luminosity with accretion rate. As our accretion\nmeasure is independent of the X-ray luminosities, we can search for radiatively\ninefficient accretion in black holes by comparing the X-ray luminosities with\nthe accretion rate in XRBs and AGN. While the X-ray luminosity of efficiently\nradiating objects scales linearly with accretion rate, the scaling of hard\nstate black holes is quadratical, in agreement with theoretical models. We show\nthat the turnover from the inefficient quadratic scaling to the linear scaling\nhas to occur at accretion rates of 1-10 % Eddington both in XRBs and AGN. The\ncomparison of both accretion states supports the idea that in a black hole in\nthe hard state some accretion power is advected into the black hole while the\njet power exceeds the X-ray luminosity: these are therefore jet-dominated\nadvective systems.",

    "summary": "Context. GRB050721 was detected by Swift and promptly followed-up, in the\nX-ray by Swift itself and, in the optical band, by the VLT operated, for the\nfirst time, in rapid response mode. A multiwavelength monitoring campaign was\nperformed in order to study its afterglow behavior. Aims. We present the\nanalysis of the early and late afterglow emission in both the X-ray and optical\nbands, as observed by Swift, a robotic telescope, and the VLT. We compare early\nobservations with late afterglow observations obtained with Swift and the VLT\nin different bands in order to constrain the density of the medium in which the\nfireball is expanding. Methods. We have analyzed both the X-ray and the optical\nlight curves and compared the spectral energy distribution of the afterglow at\ntwo different epochs. Results. We observed an intense rebrightening in the\noptical band at about one day after the burst which was not seen in the X-ray\nband. This is the first observation of a GRB afterglow in which a rebrightening\nis observed in the optical but not in the X-ray band. The lack of detection in\nX-ray of such a strong rebrightening at lower energies can be described with a\nvariable external density profile. In such a scenario, the combined X-ray and\noptical observations allow us to derive the matter density at 10^15 cm from the\nburst. This is about a factor of 10 higher than in the inner region.",

    "summary": "We discuss spectral energy distributions, photometric redshifts, redshift\ndistributions, luminosity functions, source-counts and the far infrared to\noptical luminosity ratio for sources in the SWIRE Legacy Survey. The spectral\nenergy distributions of selected SWIRE sources are modelled in terms of a\nsimple set of galaxy and quasar templates in the optical and near infrared, and\nwith a set of dust emission templates (cirrus, M82 starburst, Arp 220\nstarburst, and AGN dust torus) in the mid infrared. The optical data, together\nwith the IRAC 3.6 and 4.5 mu data, have been used to determine photometric\nredshifts. For galaxies with known spectroscopic redshifts there is a notable\nimprovement in the photometric redshift when the IRAC data are used, with a\nreduction in the rms scatter from 10% in (1+z) to 5%. While further\nspectroscopic data are needed to confirm this result, the prospect of\ndetermining good photometric redshifts for the 2 million extragalactic objects\nin SWIRE is excellent. The distribution of the different infrared sed types in\nthe L{ir}/L{opt} versus L{ir} plane, where L{ir} and L{opt} are the infrared\nand optical bolometric luminosities, is discussed.

From these detections, and limits\nin the z'-band and 4.5 micron, we infer an extinction-corrected absolute\nmagnitude, M(UV)=-20.7 mag, or ~L*, a substantial star formation rate of 15\nsolar masses per year, and a stellar mass of a few 10^9 solar masses. A\ncomparison to the published sample of spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies at\nz>5.5 reveals that the host of GRB 050904 would evade detection and/or\nconfirmation in any of the current surveys due to the lack of detectable\nLy-alpha emission, which is likely the result of dust extinction (A[1200]~1.5\nmag). This suggests that not all luminous starburst galaxies at z~6 are\ncurrently being accounted for. Most importantly, using the metallicity of\nZ~0.05 solar inferred from the afterglow absorption spectrum, our observations\nindicate for the first time that the observed evolution in the mass- and\nluminosity-metallicity relations from z=0 to z~2 continues on to z>6. The ease\nof measuring redshifts and metallicities from the afterglow emission suggests\nthat in tandem with the next generation ground- and space-based telescopes, a\nGRB mission with dedicated near-IR follow-up can provide unique information on\nthe evolution of stars and galaxies through the epoch of re-ionization.",

Because the lasers are internally\nperturbed by spontaneous emission, we include a noise source in the model to\nobtain stochastic realizations of the deterministic equations. Both amplitude\nsynchronization and phase synchronization are considered. We use the Hilbert\ntransform to define the phase variable and compute phase synchronization. We\nfind that synchronization increases with coupling strength in the experiment\nand the model. When the time series from two lasers are time-shifted in either\ndirection by the delay time, approximately equal synchronization is frequently\nobserved, so that a clear leader and follower cannot be identified. We define\nan algorithm to determine which laser leads the other when the synchronization\nis sufficiently different with one direction of time shift, and statistics of\nswitches in leader and follower are studied. The frequency of switching between\nleader and follower increases with coupling strength, as might be expected\nsince the lasers mutually influence each other more effectively with stronger\ncoupling.",

A naive\ncalculation suggests that the Hamiltonian of the closed string is of the form H\n= H0 - (g_s N) P. The same form of the Hamiltonian follows from considering the\nbosonic part of the closed string action propagating in the full D3-brane\nbackground suggesting the naive calculation captures the correct information.\nFurther, we compute explicitly P from the open string side in the bosonic\nsector and show that, in a certain limit, the result agrees with the closed\nstring expectations up to extra terms due to the fact that we ignored the\nfermionic sector. We briefly discuss extensions of the results to the\nsuperstring and to the sum of planar diagrams in field theory. In particular we\nargue that the calculations seem valid whenever one can define a sigma <-> tau\ndual Hamiltonian in the world-sheet which in principle does not require the\nexistence of a string action.

Many studies have discovered\npatterns in static graphs, identifying properties in a single snapshot of a\nlarge network, or in a very small number of snapshots; these include heavy\ntails for in- and out-degree distributions, communities, small-world phenomena,\nand others. However, given the lack of information about network evolution over\nlong periods, it has been hard to convert these findings into statements about\ntrends over time.\n  Here we study a wide range of real graphs, and we observe some surprising\nphenomena. First, most of these graphs densify over time, with the number of\nedges growing super-linearly in the number of nodes. Second, the average\ndistance between nodes often shrinks over time, in contrast to the conventional\nwisdom that such distance parameters should increase slowly as a function of\nthe number of nodes (like O(log n) or O(log(log n)).\n  Existing graph generation models do not exhibit these types of behavior, even\nat a qualitative level. We provide a new graph generator, based on a ``forest\nfire'' spreading process, that has a simple, intuitive justification, requires\nvery few parameters (like the ``flammability'' of nodes), and produces graphs\nexhibiting the full range of properties observed both in prior work and in the\npresent study.\n  We also notice that the ``forest fire'' model exhibits a sharp transition\nbetween sparse graphs and graphs that are densifying.

The X-ray spectrum of this transient is fitted equally well\nby an absorbed power-law (with a spectral index of 2.5) or multi-colour disk\nblackbody model (with kT ~ 2 keV), where we find that the source is highly\nabsorbed. We detect an unabsorbed 0.5-10 keV flux in the range (2-5)E-9 ergs\ncm^{-2} s^{-1}, which at a distance of 8 kpc corresponds to a 0.5-10 keV\nluminosity of (1-4)E37 ergs s^{-1}. No pulsations were detected by timing\nanalysis. A colour-colour diagram from ASM data of different accreting objects\nsuggests that the transient is a high-mass X-ray binary, as is also suggested\nby the high absorption compared to the average interstellar value in the\ndirection of the source. However, the power-law spectral index is far more\ntypical of a low-mass X-ray binary. Thus, we are unable to conclusively\nidentify the nature of the transient. We also report on three sources first\ndetected by the ASCA Galactic Plane Survey that are close to this transient.",

As the correlations in a random\nsystem may generate extended states and enhance transport in DC fields, we\nexplore the role that AC fields have on these properties. We find that similar\nto ordered structures, AC fields renormalize the effective hopping constant to\na smaller value, and thus help to localize a state. We find that AC fields\ncontrol then a localization-delocalization transition in a given one\ndimensional systems with correlated disorder. The competition between band\nrenormalization (band collapse/dynamic localization), Anderson localization,\nand the structure correlation is shown to result in interesting transport\nproperties.",

    "summary": "Swift discovered XRF 050416A with the BAT and began observing it with its\nnarrow field instruments only 64.5 s after the burst onset. Its very soft\nspectrum classifies this event as an X-ray flash. The afterglow X-ray emission\nwas monitored up to 74 days after the burst. The X-ray light curve initially\ndecays very fast, subsequently flattens and eventually steepens again, similar\nto many X-ray afterglows. The first and second phases end about 172 and 1450 s\nafter the burst onset, respectively. We find evidence of spectral evolution\nfrom a softer emission with photon index Gamma ~ 3.0 during the initial steep\ndecay, to a harder emission with Gamma ~ 2.0 during the following evolutionary\nphases. The spectra show intrinsic absorption in the host galaxy. The\nconsistency of the initial photon index with the high energy BAT photon index\nsuggests that the initial phase of the X-ray light curve may be the low-energy\ntail of the prompt emission. The lack of jet break signatures in the X-ray\nafterglow light curve is not consistent with empirical relations between the\nsource rest-frame peak energy and the collimation-corrected energy of the\nburst. The standard uniform jet model can give a possible description of the\nXRF 050416A X-ray afterglow for an opening angle larger than a few tens of\ndegrees, although numerical simulations show that the late time decay is\nslightly flatter than expected from on-axis viewing of a uniform jet. A\nstructured Gaussian-type jet model with uniform Lorentz factor distribution and\nviewing angle outside the Gaussian core is another possibility, although a full\nagreement with data is not achieved with the numerical models explored.",

The diffusion coefficient at the highest electron energy\ncan also be derived from the data, by relating the X-ray energy cutoff to the\nacceleration timescale. Values typically between 1 and 10 times the Bohm\ndiffusion coefficient are found to be required. We also find interesting\nconstraints on the energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient. This favours\ndiffusion regimes between the Kraichnan and the Bohm regime, and rejects\nturbulence spectrum indices larger than ~ 3/2. Finally, the maximum energy of\nthe accelerated particles is found to lay between 10^13 and 5 10^13 eV for\nelectrons, and around Z \\times 8 10^14 eV at most for nuclei (or ~ 2.5 times\nless if a Bohm diffusion regime is assumed), roughly independently of the\ncompression ratio assumed at the shock.

We study the inverse Compton emission of the breakout thermal\nsoft X-rays scattered by relativistic electrons in the jet forward shock, which\nis expected to be at larger radii than the breakout shock. This IC emission\nproduces sub-GeV to GeV photons, which may be detectable by GLAST. The\ndetection of such GeV photons simultaneously with the supernova shock breakout\nemission would give evidence for the presence of a GRB jet ahead of the shock\nwhile the shock is breaking out. The anisotropic scattering between the X-rays\nand relativistic electrons may lead to large angle emission outside of the jet\nopening angle. This has implications for the detection of GeV photons from\nburstless type Ib/c hypernova shock breakout, which due to its more isotropic\nemission might be observed with wide-field X-ray cameras such as LOBSTER.",

We discuss the impact of the redshift distribution sampling\nerror and a shear calibration error on the design of future lensing surveys,\nand find that a lensing survey of area Theta square degrees and limiting\nmagnitude m_lim}, has a minimum shear and redshift calibration accuracy\nrequirements given by epsilon = epsilon_0 10^{beta(m_lim-24.5)} / sqrt(Theta/\n200). Above that limit, lensing surveys would not reach their full potential.\nUsing the galaxy number counts from the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field, we find\n(epsilon_0,beta)=(0.015,-0.18) and (epsilon_0,beta)=(0.011,-0.23) for ground\nand space based surveys respectively. Lensing surveys with no or limited\nredshift information and/or poor shear calibration accuracy will loose their\npotential to analyse the cosmic shear signal in the sub-degree angular scales,\nand therefore complete photometric redshift coverage should be a top priority\nfor future lensing surveys.",

The\nelectrical properties of liquid helium are expected to be sufficient to meet\nthe design goals, but little is known about these properties for volumes and\nelectrode spacings appropriate to the EDM experiment. Furthermore, direct\napplication of the necessary voltages from an external source to the\nexperimental test cell is impractical. An apparatus to amplify voltages in the\nliquid helium environment and to test the electrical properties of the liquid\nfor large volumes and electrode spacings has been constructed. The device\nconsists of a large-area parallel plate capacitor immersed in a 200 liter\nliquid helium dewar.

These fields hold for more than 11 hours with\nleakage currents less than 170 pA (about 20% of the maximum tolerable in the\nEDM experiment).

Preliminary results for superfluid show that fields of\nat least 30 kV/cm can be sustained at the volumes required for the EDM\nexperiment, about 60% of the design goal.

    "summary": "We present new results from deep GALEX UV imaging of the cluster Cl 0024+17\nat z~0.4. Rest-frame far UV emission is detected from a large fraction of\nso-called ``passive spiral galaxies'' -a significant population which exhibits\nspiral morphology with little or no spectroscopic evidence for ongoing star\nformation. This population is thought to represent infalling galaxies whose\nstar formation has been somehow truncated by environmental processes, possibly\nin morphological transition to S0 galaxies. Compared to normal cluster spirals,\nwe find that passive spirals are redder in FUV-optical color, while exhibiting\nmuch stronger UV emission than cluster E/S0s - as expected for\nrecently-truncated star formation. By modeling the different temporal\nsensitivities of UV and spectroscopic data to recent activity, we show that\nstar formation in passive spirals decayed on timescales of less than 1 Gyr,\nconsistent with `gas starvation' - a process where the cluster environment\nprevents cold gas from accreting onto the spiral disk. Intriguingly, the\nfraction of spirals currently observed in the passive phase is consistent with\nthe longer period expected for the morphological transformation and the\nsubsequent build-up of cluster S0s observed since z=0.4.",

Generating functions for three\ninter-related discrete statistical models are each expressed in terms of a\nfinite series. The first term in the series corresponds to the Bethe-Peierls\n(Belief Propagation)-BP contribution, the other terms are labeled by loops on\nthe factor graph. All loop contributions are simple rational functions of spin\ncorrelation functions calculated within the BP approach. We discuss two\nalternative derivations of the loop series. One approach implements a set of\nlocal auxiliary integrations over continuous fields with the BP contribution\ncorresponding to an integrand saddle-point value. The integrals are replaced by\nsums in the complimentary approach, briefly explained in \\cite{06CCa}. A local\ngauge symmetry transformation that clarifies an important invariant feature of\nthe BP solution, is revealed in both approaches. The partition function remains\ninvariant while individual terms change under the gauge transformation. The\nrequirement for all individual terms to be non-zero only for closed loops in\nthe factor graph (as opposed to paths with loose ends) is equivalent to fixing\nthe first term in the series to be exactly equal to the BP contribution.\nFurther applications of the loop calculus to problems in statistical physics,\ncomputer and information sciences are discussed.",

    "summary": "We study the stability of fixed points in the two-loop renormalization group\nfor the random field O($N$) spin model in $4+\\epsilon$ dimensions. We solve the\nfixed-point equation in the 1/N expansion and $\\epsilon$ expansion. In the\nlarge-N limit, we study the stability of all fixed points. We solve the\neigenvalue equation for the infinitesimal deviation from the fixed points under\nphysical conditions on the random anisotropy function. We find that the fixed\npoint corresponding to dimensional reduction is singly unstable and others are\nunstable or unphysical. Therefore, one has no choice other than dimensional\nreduction in the large-N limit. The two-loop $\\beta$ function enables us to\nfind a compact area in the $(d, N)$ plane where the dimensional reduction\nbreaks down. We calculate higher-order corrections in the 1/N and $\\epsilon$\nexpansions to the fixed point. Solving the corrected eigenvalue equation\nnonperturbatively, we find that this fixed point is singly unstable also for\nsufficiently large $N$ and the critical exponents show a dimensional reduction.",

There are similar Littlewood-Richardson\nnumbers for Schur P- and Q- functions. Using a mixture of combinatorics of root\nsystems, combinatorial linear algebra in Lie algebras, and the geometry of\ncertain cominuscule flag varieties, we give Horn recursions to determine when\nthese other Littlewood-Richardson numbers are non-zero. Our inequalities come\nfrom the usual Littlewood-Richardson numbers, and while we give two very\ndifferent Horn recursions, they have the same sets of solutions.

Jacobs' rapid purification protocol uses\nHamiltonian feedback control to maximise the average purity of the qubit for a\ngiven time, with a factor of two increase in the purification rate over the\nno-feedback protocol. However, by re-examining the latter approach, we show\nthat it mininises the average time taken for a qubit to reach a given purity.\nIn fact, the average time taken for the no-feedback protocol beats that for\nJacobs' protocol by a factor of two.

The conditions for the oscillators to be\nsynchronised in phase are obtained. The role of weak noise appears to be to\ndrive the system towards a more synchronized behaviour.

Therefore, we analyzed our models of\nradiative and wind bubbles of an isolated 85 Msun star with solar metallicity\n(Kr\\\"oger et al. 2006) with respect to the chemical enrichment of the\ncircumstellar HII region. Plausibly, the hot stellar wind bubble (SWB) is\nenriched with 14N during the WN phase and even much higher with 12C and 16O\nduring the WC phase of the star. During the short period that the 85 Msun star\nspends in the WC stage enriched SWB material mixes with warm HII gas of solar\nabundances and thus enhances the metallicity in the HII region. However, at the\nend of the stellar lifetime the mass ratios of the traced elements N and O in\nthe warm ionized gas are insignificantly higher than solar, whereas an\nenrichment of 22 % above solar is found for C.

The mean metallicities of both\nstellar subpopulations, determined from mixture modelling of the metallicity\ndistribution functions, correlate with parent galaxy luminosity. This suggests\nthat the vast majority of field stars have probably formed in galactic\nfragments that were already embedded in the dark matter halo of the final\ngalaxy. The steeper correlation between the mean stellar metallicity and parent\ngalaxy luminosity is driven by an increasing fraction of metal-rich stars with\nincreasing galaxy luminosity. Metal-poor components show larger dispersion in\nmetallicity than metal-rich components. These properties are in striking\nsimilarity with those of globular cluster subpopulations around early-type\ngalaxies. The properties of field stars along the minor axis are consistent\nwith a formation scenario in which the metal-poor stars formed in all galaxies,\npossibly as a result of tidal disruption of dwarf-like objects. An additional\nmetal-rich component might be related to the formation of the bulge and/or the\ndisk.",

Here we study the Current Induced\nSwitching, electrical resistance, and magnetoresistance of thin\nMnIr/CoFe/AlO$_x$/CoFe tunnel junctions.

After switching to the low R-state some electro-migrated ions\nreturn to their initial sites through two different energy channels. A low\n(high) energy barrier of $\\sim$0.13 eV ($\\sim$0.85 eV) was estimated. Ionic\nelectromigration then occurs through two microscopic processes associated with\ndifferent types of ions sites/defects.

The LHeC makes possible\ndeep-inelastic lepton-hadron (ep, eD and eA) scattering for momentum transfers\nQ^2 beyond 10^6 GeV^2 and for Bjorken x down to the 10^{-6}. New sensitivity to\nthe existence of new states of matter, primarily in the lepton-quark sector and\nin dense partonic systems, is achieved. The precision possible with an\nelectron-hadron experiment brings in addition crucial accuracy in the\ndetermination of hadron structure, as described in Quantum Chromodynamics, and\nof parton dynamics at the TeV energy scale. The LHeC thus complements the\nproton-proton and ion programmes, adds substantial new discovery potential to\nthem, and is important for a full understanding of physics in the LHC energy\nrange.",

The afterglow was\nidentified automatically and multicolor r'i'z' imaging was triggered without\nhuman intervention. Combining our data with those obtained from later\nfollow-ups provides a well-sampled optical light-curve from 5 minutes to >2d\nafter the gamma event. The light-curve is highly structured with at least three\nbumps evident in the first 75 minutes, including a major rebrightening\n(Delta_r'=-1.6 at t=3000s), interpreted as late energy injection. At early time\n(t=440s), we find evidence for fast (Delta t_(rest)<4s<<t) variability,\nindicating on-going internal-engine activity. We emphasise that a low redshift\nGRB (z<1) with similar intrinsic properties would have been interpreted\ncompletely differently due to undersampling of the light curve in the rest\nframe at early times; the light-curve behaviour of GRB 060206 should therefore\nnot be considered peculiar. Finally, although the observed late-time steepening\nof the optical light curve resembles a jet break if taken in isolation, the\nlack of a corresponding change in the X-ray slope rules out a jet-break\ninterpretation. Traditionally, GRB jet breaks have been inferred from optical\ndata in the absence of simultaneous X-ray data. We suggest therefore that\ncurrent estimates of the jet opening angle distribution might be biased by\nevents like GRB060206. Consequently, the GRB explosion energy distribution and\nevent rates may have to be revised.",

We\nhave therefore used computer models to see whether such planets could be\ndynamically stable in the presence of the more massive planets known to be\npresent, and in particular whether planets with roughly an Earth mass could\nremain confined to the classical habitable zone (HZ) for long enough for life\nto have emerged.\n  Measured stellar properties have been used to determine for each system the\npresent location of the HZ. We have also determined the critical distances from\nthe orbit of each giant planet within which an Earth-mass planet would suffer\nlarge orbital changes. We then evaluated the present habitability of each and\nevery exoplanetary system by examining the penetration of these critical\ndistances into the HZ. The critical distances can be obtained by extensive\ncomputer modelling of an exoplanetary system. This is far too time consuming to\napply to all of the 150 or so systems already known, and to keep up with the\nlatest discoveries. Therefore, in earlier work we studied a few systems in\ngreat detail, and developed a speedier means of obtaining the critical\ndistances. We summarize this comparatively quick method here. We can then\nevaluate comparatively quickly the present habitability of each exoplanetary\nsystem by examining the penetration of the critical distance(s) into the HZ.\nThe results are encouraging for astrobiology.",

    "summary": "The efficiency of an encounter-controlled two-channel reaction between two\nindependently-mobile reactants on a lattice is characterized by the mean number\n$\\rt$ of steps to reaction. The two reactants are distinguished by their mass\nwith the \"light\" walker performing a jump to a nearest-neighbor site in each\ntime step, while the \"heavy\" walker hops only with a probability $p$; we\nassociate $p$ with the \"temperature\" of the system. Lattices subject to\nperiodic and to confining boundary conditions are considered. For periodic\nlattices, depending on the initial state, the reaction time either falls off\nmonotonically with $p$ or displays a local minimum with respect to $p$;\noccurrence of the latter signals a regime where the efficiency of the reaction\neffectively decreases with increasing temperature. Such behavior disappears if\nthe jump probability of the light walker falls below a characteristic threshold\nvalue. In lattices subject to confining boundary conditions, the behavior is\nmore complex. Depending on the initial conditions, the reaction time as a\nfunction of $p$ may increase monotonically, decrease monotonically, display a\nsingle maximum or even a maximum and minimum. These inverted regions are a\nconsequence of a strictly classical interplay between excluded volume effects\nimplicit in the specification of the two reaction channels, and the system's\ndimensionality and spatial extent. Our results highlight situations where the\ndescription of an encounter-controlled reactive event cannot be described by a\nsingle, effective diffusion coefficient. We also distinguish between the\ninversion region identified here and the Marcus inverted region which arises in\nelectron transfer reactions.",

Fillers have been used in order to improve, among the others,\nmechanical, rheological, electrical, magnetic and thermal properties of the\nhost material. Changes in the shape and size of the filler particles are known\nto affect and, in some cases, magnify such enhancement. This effect is usually\nassociated with an increased probability of formation of a percolating cluster\nof filler particles in the matrix. Previous model calculations of percolation\nin polymeric systems generally did not take the possible difference between the\nsize and shape of monomers and filler particles into account and usually\nneglected interactions or accounted for them in a crude fashion. In our\napproach the original lattice is replaced by a recursive structure on which\ncalculations are done exactly and interactions as well as size and shape\ndisparities can be easily taken into account. Here we introduce the recursive\napproach, we describe how to derive the percolation threshold as a function of\nthe various parameters of the problem and we apply the new approach to the\nanalysis of the effect of correlations among monodisperse particles on the\npercolation threshold of a system.

These\nfillers are usuallly polydisperse and there is an extensive experimental\nevidence that their size and shape profoundly affects the properties of the\nresulting material. In particular, it is generally found that the percolation\nthreshold decreases as the size disparity between the different particles\npresent in a system increases and that the threshold decreases with the aspect\nratio of the particles. Here a recursive approach that we have recently\nintroduced is applied to the study of the percolation of particles of different\nsizes and shapes, without the presence of a polymer matrix, on a lattice in\nvarious phases including metastable states. In our approach the original\nlattice is replaced by a recursive structure on which calculations are done\nexactly and interactions as well as size and shape disparities can be easily\ntaken into account In the previous paper we have introduced the recursive\napproach and shown how correlations among particles of the same size can affect\npercolation. Before considering the complete system made of particles of\nvarious sizes and shapes embedded in a polymer matrix here we describe the\nproperties of systems made of particles without any matrix.

The procedure consists\nof aggregation probabilities proportional to the squared number of occupied\nsites ($k^2$). In the present work, we analyzed this algorithm using the noise\nreduced version of the DLA model and large scale simulations. In the noiseless\nlimit, instead of isotropic patterns, a $45^\\circ$ ($30^\\circ$) rotation in the\nanisotropy directions of the clusters grown on square (triangular) lattices was\nobserved. A generalized algorithm, in which the aggregation probability is\nproportional to $k^\\nu$, was proposed. The exponent $\\nu$ has a nonuniversal\ncritical value $\\nu_c$, for which the patterns generated in the noiseless limit\nexhibit the original (axial) anisotropy for $\\nu<\\nu_c$ and the rotated one\n(diagonal) for $\\nu>\\nu_c$. The values $\\nu_c = 1.395\\pm0.005$ and $\\nu_c =\n0.82\\pm 0.01$ were found for square and triangular lattices, respectively.\nMoreover, large scale simulations show that there are a nontrivial relation\nbetween noise reduction and anisotropy direction.

The size (6582 galaxies), depth (I_AB<=24) and redshift sampling\nrate of the survey enable us to reconstruct the 3D galaxy environment on\nrelatively local scales (R=5 Mpc) up to z~1.5. Particular attention has been\ndevoted to calibrate a density reconstruction scheme, which factors out survey\nselection effects and reproduces in an unbiased way the underlying `real'\ngalaxy environment. While at lower redshift we confirm the existence of a steep\ncolour-density relation, with the fraction of the reddest(/bluest) galaxies of\nthe same luminosity increasing(/decreasing) as a function of density, this\ntrend progressively disappears in the highest redshift bins investigated. The\nrest frame u*-g' colour-magnitude diagram shows a bimodal pattern in both low\nand high density environments up to z~1.5. We find that the bimodal\ndistribution is not universal but strongly depends upon environment: at lower\nredshifts the colour-magnitude diagrams in low and high density regions are\nsignificantly different while the progressive weakening of the colour-density\nrelation causes the two bimodal distributions to nearly mirror each other in\nthe highest redshift bin investigated. Both the colour-density and the\ncolour-magnitude-density relations appear to be a transient, cumulative product\nof genetic and environmental factors operating over at least a period of 9 Gyr.\nThese findings support an evolutionary scenario in which star formation/gas\ndepletion processes are accelerated in more luminous objects and in high\ndensity environments: star formation activity is shifting with cosmic time\ntowards lower luminosity (downsizing), and out of high density environments.",

    "summary": "We discuss the first astronomical detection of the CF+ (fluoromethylidynium)\nion, obtained by observations of the J=1-0 (102.6 GHz), J=2-1 (205.2 GHz) and\nJ=3-2 (307.7 GHz) rotational transitions toward the Orion Bar region. Our\nsearch for CF+, carried out using the IRAM 30m and APEX 12m telescopes, was\nmotivated by recent theoretical models that predict CF+ abundances of a few\ntimes 1.E-10 in UV-irradiated molecular regions where C+ is present. The CF+\nion is produced by exothermic reactions of C+ with HF. Because fluorine atoms\ncan react exothermically with H2, HF is predicted to be the dominant reservoir\nof fluorine, not only in well-shielded regions but also in the surface layers\nof molecular clouds where the C+ abundance is large. The observed CF+ line\nintensities imply the presence of CF+ column densities of at least 1.E+12 cm-2\nover a region of size at least ~ 1 arcmin, in good agreement with theoretical\npredictions. They provide support for our current theories of interstellar\nfluorine chemistry, which suggest that hydrogen fluoride should be ubiquitous\nin interstellar gas clouds and widely detectable in absorption by future\nsatellite and airborne observatories.",

    "summary": "We present submillimetre data for the L1689 cloud in the rho-Ophiuchi\nmolecular cloud complex. We detect a number of starless and prestellar cores\nand protostellar envelopes. We also detect a number of filaments for the first\ntime in the submillimetre continuum that are parallel both to each other, and\nto filaments observed in the neighbouring L1688 cloud. These filaments are also\nseen in the 13CO observations of L1689. The filaments contain all of the\nstar-formation activity in the cloud. L1689 lies next to the well studied L1688\ncloud that contains the rho Oph-A core. L1688 has a much more active\nstar-formation history than L1689 despite their apparent similarity in 13CO\ndata. Hence we label L1689 as the dog that didn't bark. We endeavour to explain\nthis apparent anomaly by comparing the total mass of each cloud that is\ncurrently in the form of dense material such as prestellar cores. We note\nfirstly that L1688 is more massive than L1689, but we also find that when\nnormalised to the total mass of each cloud, the L1689 cloud has a much lower\npercentage of mass in dense cores than L1688. We attribute this to the\nhypothesis of Loren (1989) that the star formation in the rho-Ophiuchi complex\nis being affected and probably dominated by the external influence of the\nnearby Upper Scorpius OB association and predominantly by sigma-Sco. L1689 is\nfurther from sigma-Sco and is therefore less active. The influence of sigma-Sco\nappears nonetheless to have created the filaments that we observe in L1689.\nAccepted by MNRAS.",

The flares\nwere simulated by calculating the hydrodynamic response of a model M dwarf\natmosphere to a beam of non-thermal electrons. Radiative backwarming through\nnumerous soft X-ray, extreme ultraviolet, and ultraviolet transitions are also\nincluded. The equations of radiative transfer and statistical equilibrium are\ntreated in non-LTE for many transitions of hydrogen, helium and the Ca II ion\nallowing the calculation of detailed line profiles and continuum radiation. Two\nsimulations were carried out, with electron beam fluxes corresponding to\nmoderate and strong beam heating. In both cases we find the dynamics can be\nnaturally divided into two phases: an initial gentle phase in which hydrogen\nand helium radiate away much of the beam energy, and an explosive phase\ncharacterized by large hydrodynamic waves. During the initial phase, lower\nchromospheric material is evaporated into higher regions of the atmosphere\ncausing many lines and continua to brighten dramatically. The He II Lya line is\nespecially enhanced, becoming the brightest line in the flaring spectrum. The\nhydrogen Balmer lines also become much brighter and show very broad line\nwidths, in agreement with observations. We compare our predicted Balmer\ndecrements to decrements calculated for several flare observations and find the\npredictions to be in general agreement with the observations. During the\nexplosive phase both condensation and evaporation waves are produced. The\nmoderate flare simulation predicts a peak evaporation wave of 130 km/s and a\ncondensation wave of 30 km/s. The velocity of the condensation wave matches\nvelocities observed in several transition region lines.",

In order to go beyond the circuit approximation for thin double layers,\nour analysis is based on the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations of dilute\nsolution theory. Unlike most previous studies, however, we focus on the\nnonlinear regime, where the applied voltage across the conductor is larger than\nthe thermal voltage. In such strong electric fields, the classical model\npredicts that the double layer adsorbs enough ions to produce bulk\nconcentration gradients and surface conduction. Our analysis begins with a\ngeneral derivation of surface conservation laws in the thin double-layer limit,\nwhich provide effective boundary conditions on the quasi-neutral bulk. We solve\nthe resulting nonlinear partial differential equations numerically for strong\nfields and also perform a time-dependent asymptotic analysis for weaker fields,\nwhere bulk diffusion and surface conduction arise as first-order corrections.\nWe also derive various dimensionless parameters comparing surface to bulk\ntransport processes, which generalize the Bikerman-Dukhin number.

Within\nthis picture, a quantum particle represents a coherent region of a quantum wave\nwith characteristic total energy, momentum, and spin. The dynamics of such a\nstate are described by the usual linear quantum wave equations. But the\ncoherence is maintained by a nonlinear self-interaction term that is evident\nonly during transitions from one quantum state to another. This is analogous to\nthe self-organizing property of domains in a ferromagnetic material, in which a\nsingle domain may appear as a stable macro-particle, but with rapid transitions\nbetween different domain configurations also possible. For the quantum case,\nthis implies that the \"collapse of the wave function\" is a real dynamical\nphysical process that occurs continuously in spacetime.

The focus in this effort is on the analysis\nof charge transport. Our results for the one-orbital case confirm and extend\nprevious recent investigations that showed the presence of robust peaks in the\nresistivity vs. temperature curves for this model. Quenched disorder\nsubstantially enhances the magnitude of the effect, while magnetic fields\ndrastically reduce the resistivity. A simple picture for the origin of these\nresults is presented. It is also shown that even for the case of just one\nelectron, the resistance curves present metallic and insulating regions by\nvarying the temperature, as it occurs at finite electronic density. Moreover,\nin the present study these investigations are extended to the more realistic\ntwo-orbital model for manganites. The transport results for this model show\nlarge peaks in the resistivity vs. temperature curves, located at approximately\nthe Curie temperature, and with associated large magnetoresistance factors.\nOverall, the magnitude and shape of the effects discussed here closely resemble\nexperiments for materials such as $\\rm La_{0.70} Ca_{0.30} Mn O_{3}$, and they\nare in qualitative agreement with the current predominant theoretical view that\ncompetition between a metal and an insulator, enhanced by quenched disorder, is\ncrucial to understand the colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) phenomenon.",

Here, we present the first\nformal analytical proof showing that, during the exponential growth of the\ninstability, the mean (averaged over the disc scale-height) Reynolds stress is\nalways positive, the mean Maxwell stress is always negative, and hence the mean\ntotal stress is positive and leads to a net outward flux of angular momentum.\nMore importantly, we show that the ratio of the Maxwell to the Reynolds\nstresses during the late times of the exponential growth of the instability is\ndetermined only by the local shear and does not depend on the initial spectrum\nof perturbations or the strength of the seed magnetic. Even though we derived\nthese properties of the stress tensors for the exponential growth of the\ninstability in incompressible flows, numerical simulations of shearing boxes\nshow that this characteristic is qualitatively preserved under more general\nconditions, even during the saturated turbulent state generated by the\ninstability.",

In a cool disk with rapid enough cooling, the\nspiral arms in an unstable disk form self-gravitating clumps. Whether gas giant\nprotoplanets can form by such a disk instability process is the primary\nquestion addressed by this review. We discuss the wide range of calculations\nundertaken by ourselves and others using various numerical techniques, and we\nreport preliminary results from a large multi-code collaboration. Additional\ntopics include -- triggering mechanisms for GI's, disk heating and cooling,\norbital survival of dense clumps, interactions of solids with GI-driven waves\nand shocks, and hybrid scenarios where GI's facilitate core accretion.

The\nmagnitude of this kick has bearing on the production and growth of supermassive\nblack holes during the epoch of structure formation, and on the retention of\nblack holes in stellar clusters. Here we report the first accurate numerical\ncalculation of this kick, for two nonspinning black holes in a 1.5:1 mass\nratio, which is expected based on analytic considerations to give a significant\nfraction of the maximum possible recoil. We have performed multiple runs with\ndifferent initial separations, orbital angular momenta, resolutions, extraction\nradii, and gauges. The full range of our kick speeds is 86--116 km s$^{-1}$,\nand the most reliable runs give kicks between 86 and 97 km s$^{-1}$.

    "summary": "We derive the full Wess-Zumino-Witten term of a gauged chiral lagrangian in\nD=4 by starting from a pure Yang-Mills theory of gauged quark flavor in a flat,\ncompactified D=5. The theory is compactified such that there exists a B_5 zero\nmode, and supplemented with quarks that are ``chirally delocalized'' with q_L\n(q_R) on the left (right) boundary (brane). The theory then necessarily\ncontains a Chern-Simons term (anomaly flux) to cancel the fermionic anomalies\non the boundaries. The constituent quark mass represents chiral symmetry\nbreaking and is a bilocal operator in D=5 of the form: \\bar{q}_LWq_R+h.c, where\nW is the Wilson line spanning the bulk, 0\\leq x^5 \\leq R and is interpreted as\na chiral meson field, W=\\exp(2i\\tilde{\\pi}/f_\\pi), where f_\\pi \\sim 1/R. The\nquarks are integrated out, yielding a Dirac determinant which takes the form of\na ``boundary term'' (anomaly flux return), and is equivalent to Bardeen's\ncounterterm that connects consistent and covariant anomalies. The\nWess-Zumino-Witten term then emerges straightforwardly, from the Yang-Mills\nChern-Simons term, plus boundary term. The method is systematic and allows\ngeneralization of the Wess-Zumino-Witten term to theories of extra dimensions,\nand to express it in alternative and more compact forms.

We provide new estimates of the Cosmic\nInfrared Background (CIB), and compare it with the Cosmic Optical Background\n(COB). Methods. Using Spitzer data at 24, 70 and 160um in three deep fields, we\nstacked more than 19000 MIPS 24um sources with S24>60uJy at 70 and 160um, and\nmeasured the resulting FIR flux densities. Results. This method allows a gain\nup to one order of magnitude in depth in the FIR. We find that the Mid-Infrared\n(MIR) 24um selected sources contribute to more than 70% of the CIB at 70 and\n160um. This is the first direct measurement of the contribution of MIR-selected\ngalaxies to the FIR CIB. Galaxies contributing the most to the total CIB are\nthus z~1 luminous infrared galaxies, which have intermediate stellar masses. We\nestimate that the CIB will be resolved at 0.9 mJy at 70 and 3 mJy at 160um. By\ncombining the extrapolation of the 24um source counts below 60uJy, with 160/24\nand 70/24 colors as measured with the stacking analysis, we obtain lower limits\nof 7.1+/-1.0 and 13.4+/-1.7 nW/m2/sr for the CIB at 70 and 160um, respectively.\nConclusions. The MIPS surveys have resolved more than three quarters of the MIR\nand FIR CIB. By carefully integrating the Extragalactic Background Light (EBL)\nSED, we also find that the CIB has the same brightness as the COB, around 24\nnW/m2/sr. The EBL is produced on average by 115 infrared photons for one\nvisible photon.

We give a\ncharacterisation of the amoeba based on the triangle inequality, which we call\ntesting for lopsidedness. We show that if a point is outside the amoeba of V,\nthere is an element of the defining ideal which witnesses this fact by being\nlopsided. This condition is necessary and sufficient for amoebas of arbitrary\ncodimension, as well as for compactifications of amoebas inside any toric\nvariety. Our approach naturally leads to methods for approximating hypersurface\namoebas and their spines by systems of linear inequalities. Finally, we remark\nthat our main result can be seen a precise analogue of a Nullstellensatz\nstatement for tropical varieties.",

    "summary": "We observe a thermally induced spontaneous magnetization reversal of\nepitaxial ferromagnet/antiferromagnet heterostructures under a constant applied\nmagnetic field. Unlike any other magnetic system, the magnetization\nspontaneously reverses, aligning anti-parallel to an applied field with\ndecreasing temperature. We show that this unusual phenomenon is caused by the\ninterfacial antiferromagnetic coupling overcoming the Zeeman energy of the\nferromagnet. A significant temperature hysteresis exists, whose height and\nwidth can be tuned by the field applied during thermal cycling. The hysteresis\noriginates from the intrinsic magnetic anisotropy in the system. The\nobservation of this phenomenon leads to open questions in the general\nunderstanding of magnetic heterostructures. Moreover, this shows that in\ngeneral heterogeneous nanostructured materials may exhibit unexpected phenomena\nabsent in the bulk.",

During the hard\nintervals (corresponding to state C in the classification of Belloni et al.,\n2000, A&A, 35, 271), we find a significant QPO at a frequency of ~170 Hz,\nalthough much broader (Q~2) than previously reported. No other significant peak\nis observed at frequencies >30 Hz. A time-resolved spectral analysis of\nselected observations shows that the hard intervals from class theta show a\nstronger and steeper (Gamma=2.8-3.0) power-law component than hard intervals\nfrom other classes. We discuss these results in the framework of hecto-Hertz\nQPOs reported from GRS 1915+105 and other black-hole binaries.",

    "summary": "(Abridged) The orbits of the recently discovered satellites of Pluto, S/2005\nP2 and S/2005 P1, are significantly non-Keplerian, even if P2 and P1 have\nnegligible masses, because the mass ratio of Charon-Pluto is ~0.1. We present\nan analytic theory with P2 and P1 treated as test particles. This analytic\ntheory shows that the azimuthal periods of P2 and P1 are shorter than the\nKeplerian orbital periods and that the periapse and ascending node of each of\nthe satellites precess at nearly equal rates in opposite directions. The\ndeviation from Kepler's third law is already detected in the unperturbed\nKeplerian fit of Buie and coworkers. We also present direct numerical orbit\nintegrations with different assumed masses for P2 and P1 within the ranges\nallowed by the albedo uncertainties. If the albedos are as high as that of\nCharon, the masses of P2 and P1 are sufficiently low that their orbits are well\ndescribed by the analytic theory. There is at present no evidence that P2 has\nany significant epicyclic eccentricity. However, the orbit of P1 has a\nsignificant epicyclic eccentricity, and its prograde periapse precession with a\nperiod of 5300 days should be easily detectable. If the albedos are as low as\nthat of comets, the large inferred masses induce significant variations in the\nepicyclic eccentricities and/or periapse longitudes on the 400-500-day\ntimescales, due to the proximity of P2 and P1 to the 3:2 mean-motion\ncommensurability. In fact, for the maximum inferred masses, P2 and P1 may be in\nthe 3:2 mean-motion resonance, with the resonance variable involving the\nperiapse longitude of P1 librating. Observations that sample the orbits of P2\nand P1 well on the 400-500-day timescales should provide strong constraints on\nthe masses of P2 and P1 in the near future.",

The spectrum exhibits many prominent optical recombination\nlines (ORLs) from heavy element ions. Analysis of the H {\\sc i} and He {\\sc i}\nrecombination spectrum yields an electron temperature of $\\sim 900$ K, a factor\nof ten lower than given by the collisionally excited [O {\\sc iii}] forbidden\nlines. The ionic abundances of heavy elements relative to hydrogen derived from\nORLs are about a factor of 70 higher than those deduced from collisionally\nexcited lines (CELs) from the same ions, the largest abundance discrepancy\nfactor (adf) ever measured for a PN. By comparing the observed O {\\sc ii}\n$\\lambda$4089/$\\lambda$4649 ORL ratio to theoretical value as a function of\nelectron temperature, we show that the O {\\sc ii} ORLs arise from ionized\nregions with an electron temperature of only $\\sim 630$ K. The current\nobservations thus provide the strongest evidence that the nebula contains\nanother previously unknown component of cold, high metallicity gas, which is\ntoo cool to excite any significant optical or UV CELs and is thus invisible via\nsuch lines. The existence of such a plasma component in PNe provides a natural\nsolution to the long-standing dichotomy between nebular plasma diagnostics and\nabundance determinations using CELs on the one hand and ORLs on the other.",

Together, the\nalgorithms detect essentially all affected data whilst the amount of data which\nis not affected by interference but falsely marked as such is kept to a\nminimum. The sections marked by Pieflag are very similar to what would be\ndeemed affected by the observer in a visual inspection of the data. Pieflag\ndisplays its results concisely and allows the user to add and remove flags\ninteractively. It is written in Python, is easy to install and use, and has a\nvariety of options to adjust its algorithms to a particular observing\nsituation.

However, it is still debatable whether\nstarbursts are ubiquitously present in galaxies harboring QSOs. In this paper\nwe review our current knowledge from observations of the role of starbursts in\ndifferent types of QSOs. Post-starburst stellar populations are potentially\npresent in the majority of QSO hosts. QSOs with far-infrared colors similar to\nthose of ultraluminous infrared galaxies invariably reside in merging galaxies\nthat have interaction-induced starbursts of a few hundred Myr or less. Similar,\nbut dramatically more luminous post-starburst populations are found in the\nrecently discovered class of QSOs known as post-starburst QSOs, or Q+A's. Both\nof these classes, however, comprise only a small fraction (10-15%) of the total\nQSO population. The so-called \"red\" QSOs generally suffer from strong\nextinction at optical wavelengths, making them ideal candidates for the study\nof hosts. Their stellar populations typically show a post-starburst component\nas well, though with a larger range of ages. Finally, optical \"classical\" QSO\nhosts show traces of major star formation episodes (typically involving >10% of\nthe mass of the stellar component) in the more distant past (1-2 Gyr). These\nstarbursts appear to be linked to past merger events. It remains to be\ndetermined whether these mergers were also responsible for triggering the QSO\nactivity that we observe today.",

We assume the codebook is randomly constructed where the entries\nare independent and isotropically distributed. It has been shown that the\nrandomly constructed codebook is asymptotically optimal. In this paper, we\nconsider two types of signature selection criteria. One is to select the\nsignature vector that minimizes the interference from other users.

By letting the processing gain, number of users and feedback bits\napproach infinity with fixed ratios, we derive the exact asymptotic formulas to\ncalculate the average interference for both criteria. Our simulations\ndemonstrate the theoretical formulas. The analysis can be extended to evaluate\nthe signal-to-interference plus noise ratio performance for both match filter\nand linear minimum mean-square error receivers.",

We also compare the results of the no-recoil calculations with those of\nthe zero-range approximation often used to handle the knock-on exchange effect.",

    "summary": "We have developed a cosmic ray (CR) shock code in one dimensional spherical\ngeometry with which the particle distribution, the gas flow and their nonlinear\ninteraction can be followed numerically in a frame comoving with an expanding\nshock. In order to accommodate a very wide dynamic range of diffusion length\nscales in the CR shock problem, we have incorporated subzone shock tracking and\nadaptive mesh refinement techniques. We find the spatial grid resolution\nrequired for numerical convergence is less stringent in this code compared to\ntypical, fixed-grid Eulerian codes. The improved convergence behavior derives\nfrom maintaining the shock discontinuity inside the same grid zone in the\ncomoving code. That feature improves numerical estimates of the compression\nrate experienced by CRs crossing the subshock compared to codes that allow the\nsubshock to drift on the grid. Using this code with a Bohm-like diffusion model\nwe have calculated the CR acceleration and the nonlinear feedback at supernova\nremnant shocks during the Sedov-Taylor stage. Similarly to plane-parallel\nshocks, with an adopted thermal leakage injection model, about 10^{-3} of the\nparticles that pass through the shock and up to 60 % of the explosion energy\nare transferred to the CR component. These results are in good agreement with\nprevious nonlinear spherical CR shock calculations of Berezhko and\ncollaborators.",

This is a non-Friedmann model with a non-uniform static space-time.\nThe major dynamical factor controlling the local expansion is the antigravity\nproduced by the omnipresent and permanent dark energy of the cosmic vacuum (or\nthe cosmological constant). The antigravity dominates at distances larger than\n1-2 Mpc from the center of the Local Group. The model gives a natural\nexplanation of the two key quantitative characteristics of the local expansion\nflow, which are the local Hubble constant and the velocity dispersion of the\nflow. The observed kinematical similarity of the local and global flows of\nexpansion is clarified by the model. We demonstrate analytically the efficiency\nof the vacuum cooling mechanism that allows one to see the Hubble flow so close\nto the Local Group. Special significance is argued for the 'universal Hubble\nconstant' H_V, depending only on the vacuum density (H_V \\approx 60 km/s/Mpc).\nThe model makes a number of testable predictions. It also shows unexpectedly\nthat it is the dwarf galaxies of the local flow with the shortest distances and\nlowest redshifts that may be the most sensitive indicators of dark energy in\nour neighborhood.",

    "summary": "In this paper we report new evidence that measurements of the broad-line\nwidths in quasars are dependent on the source orientation, consistent with the\nidea that the broad-line region is flattened or disc-like. This reinforces the\nview derived from radio-selected samples, where the radio-core dominance has\nbeen used as a measure of orientation. The results presented here show a highly\nsignificant (>99.95%) correlation between radio spectral index (which we use as\na proxy for source orientation) and broad-line width derived from the H-beta\nand MgII emission lines. This is the first time that this type of study has\nused quasars derived from a large optically selected quasar sample, where the\nradio-loud quasars (RLQs) and radio-quiet quasars (RQQs) have indistinguishable\ndistributions in redshift, bolometric luminosity and colour, and therefore\novercomes any biases which may be present in only selecting via radio emission.\nWe find that the mean FWHM for the flat-spectrum radio-loud quasars (FSQs) to\nbe <FWHM(FSQ)>= 4990 +/- 536km/s, which differs significant from the mean FWHM\nof the steep-spectrum radio-loud quasars (SSQs), where <FWHM(SSQ)>=6464 +/-\n506km/s. We also find that the distribution in FWHM for the FSQs is\nindistinguishable from that of the radio-quiet quasars (RQQs), where\n<FWHM(RQQ)>= 4831 +/-25km/s. Considering other observational results in the\nliterature we interpret this result in the context of a significant fraction of\nthe FSQs being derived from the underlying RQQ population which have their\nradio flux Doppler boosted above the RLQ/RQQ divide. Under the assumption of a\ndisc-like broad-line region we find no evidence for a difference in the average\nline-of-sight angle for RQQs and RLQs, implying that the difference is due to\nblack-hole mass.

When the control parameter\nfine-graining order is small enough, the two measures are almost equal.

In QCD such kinematics leads to the BFKL equation\nfor the Pomeron wave function in the leading logarithmic approximation.

The\npurpose of this investigation is to find a generalization of the BFKL approach\nto the region of small momentum transfers where non-perturbative corrections to\nthe gluon Regge trajectory and reggeon couplings are essential. The BFKL\nequation in the string theory contains additional contributions coming from a\nlinear part of the Regge trajectory and from the soft Pomeron singularity\nappearing already in the tree approximation. In higher dimensions in addition,\na non-multi-Regge kinematics corresponding to production of particles with\nlarge masses is important.

For an observer in the vicinity of a central\noverdensity, the perceived local evolution is consistent with acceleration in\nthe direction towards the center of the overdensity, and deceleration\nperpendicularly to it. A negative mass leads to deceleration along the radial\ndirection, and acceleration perpendicularly to it. If the observer is located\nat the center of an overdensity the null geodesics are radial.

We calibrate the coefficients with existing\nturbulent-disk simulations and mean-migration estimates, and solve the equation\nboth analytically and numerically.

Diffusion systematically reduces the lifetime of most\nplanets, yet it allows a declining fraction of them to survive for extended\nperiods of time at large radii. Mean planet lifetimes can even be formally\ninfinite (e.g. in an infinite steady MMSN), though median lifetimes are always\nfinite. Surviving planets may linger near specific radii where the combined\neffects of advection and diffusion are minimized, or at large radii, depending\non model specifics. The stochastic nature of migration in turbulent disks\nchallenges deterministic planet formation scenarios and suggests instead that a\nwide variety of planetary outcomes are possible from similar initial\nconditions. This would contribute to the diversity of (extrasolar) planetary\nsystems.",

We analyzed the data collected with EPIC-pn in Timing and Burst modes,\nrespectively. No thermal disc emission is required by the data; the spectrum is\nwell fitted by four components: a primary component (either a simple power law\nor thermal Comptonization) absorbed by cold matter with abundances different\nthan those of standard ISM; reprocessing from an ionized disc; emission and\nabsorption lines; and a soft X-ray excess around 1 keV. The latter is not\nconfirmed by RGS (which were used in the second observation only); if real, the\nexcess could be due to reflection from the optically thin, photoionized plasma\nof a disc wind, in which case it may provide a way to disentangle intrinsic\nfrom interstellar absorption. Indeed, the former is best traced by the higher\nabundances of heavier elements, while an independent estimate of the latter may\nbe given by the value we get for the disc wind component only, which roughly\ncoincides with what is found for lower-Z species.",

    "summary": "In a relativistic classical and quantum mechanics with Poincare-invariant\nparameter, particle worldlines are traced out by the evolution of spacetime\nevents. In pre-Maxwell electrodynamics -- the local gauge theory associated\nwith this framework -- events induce five local off-shell fields, which mediate\ninteractions between instantaneous events, not between the worldlines which\nrepresent entire particle histories. The fifth field, required to compensate\nfor dependence of gauge transformations on the evolution parameter, enables the\nexchange of mass between particles and fields. In the equilibrium limit, these\npre-Maxwell fields are pushed onto the zero-mass shell, but during interactions\nthere is no mechanism regulating the mass that photons may acquire, even when\nevent trajectories evolve far into the spacelike region. This feature of the\noff-shell formalism requires the application of some ad hoc mechanism for\ncontrolling the photon mass in low energy classical Coulomb scattering of\ncharged events, and in the renormalization of off-shell quantum\nelectrodynamics. We discuss a nonlocal, higher derivative correction to the\nphoton kinetic term, which provides regulation of the photon mass in a manner\nthat preserves the gauge invariance and Poincare covariance of the original\ntheory. We demonstrate that the inclusion of this term is equivalent to an\nearlier solution to the classical Coulomb problem, and that the resulting\nquantum field theory is renormalized.",

    "summary": "It is an open challenge to analyze the crystalline color superconducting\nphases that may arise in cold dense, but not asymptotically dense, three-flavor\nquark matter. At present the only approximation within which it seems possible\nto compare the free energies of the myriad possible crystal structures is the\nGinzburg-Landau approximation. Here, we test this approximation on a\nparticularly simple \"crystal\" structure in which there are only two condensates\n$<us > \\sim \\Delta \\exp(i {\\bf q_2}\\cdot {\\bf r})$ and $<ud > \\sim \\Delta\n\\exp(i {\\bf q_3}\\cdot {\\bf r})$ whose position-space dependence is that of two\nplane waves with wave vectors ${\\bf q_2}$ and ${\\bf q_3}$ at arbitrary angles.\nFor this case, we are able to solve the mean-field gap equation without making\na Ginzburg-Landau approximation. We find that the Ginzburg-Landau approximation\nworks in the $\\Delta\\to 0$ limit as expected, find that it correctly predicts\nthat $\\Delta$ decreases with increasing angle between ${\\bf q_2}$ and ${\\bf\nq_3}$ meaning that the phase with ${\\bf q_2}\\parallel {\\bf q_3}$ has the lowest\nfree energy, and find that the Ginzburg-Landau approximation is conservative in\nthe sense that it underestimates $\\Delta$ at all values of the angle between\n${\\bf q_2}$ and ${\\bf q_3}$.",

This volume formula holds for Grassmann manifolds with\narbitrary dimension n and p, while previous results pertained only to p=1, or a\nfixed p with asymptotically large n. Based on this result, several quantization\nbounds are derived for sphere packing and rate distortion tradeoff. We\nestablish asymptotically equivalent lower and upper bounds for the rate\ndistortion tradeoff. Since the upper bound is derived by constructing random\ncodes, this result implies that the random codes are asymptotically optimal.\nThe above results are also extended to the more general case, in which\n\\mathcal{G}_{n,q} is quantized through a code in \\mathcal{G}_{n,p}, where p and\nq are not necessarily the same.

    "summary": "It is well known that Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems have high\nspectral efficiency, especially when channel state information at the\ntransmitter (CSIT) is available. When CSIT is obtained by feedback, it is\npractical to assume that the channel state feedback rate is finite and the CSIT\nis not perfect. For such a system, we consider beamforming and power on/off\nstrategy for its simplicity and near optimality, where power on/off means that\na beamforming vector (beam) is either turned on with a constant power or turned\noff. The main contribution of this paper is to accurately evaluate the\ninformation rate as a function of the channel state feedback rate. Name a beam\nturned on as an on-beam and the minimum number of the transmit and receive\nantennas as the dimension of a MIMO system. We prove that the ratio of the\noptimal number of on-beams and the system dimension converges to a constant for\na given signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when the numbers of transmit and receive\nantennas approach infinity simultaneously and when beamforming is perfect.\nAsymptotic formulas are derived to evaluate this ratio and the corresponding\ninformation rate per dimension. The asymptotic results can be accurately\napplied to finite dimensional systems and suggest a power on/off strategy with\na constant number of on-beams. For this suboptimal strategy, we take a novel\napproach to introduce power efficiency factor, which is a function of the\nfeedback rate, to quantify the effect of imperfect beamforming. By combining\npower efficiency factor and the asymptotic formulas for perfect beamforming\ncase, the information rate of the power on/off strategy with a constant number\nof on-beams is accurately characterized.",

The direct detection rates are quite low and a\nsubstantial improvement in experimental sensitivity would be required for\nobservation. A substantial flux of energetic gamma rays is produced in the\nannihilation of the heavy photons in the galactic halo. This flux can be\nobserved by the GLAST telescope, and, if the distribution of dark matter in the\nhalo is favorable, by ground-based telescope arrays such as VERITAS and HESS.",

The implementation of a\ngiven unitary can then optimize the tradeoff between gate time and resources\nused. These ideas are illustrated for qudits encoded in the ground hyperfine\nstates of the atomic alkalies $^{87}$Rb and $^{133}$Cs. Second, we provide a\nprotocol for implementing parallelized non-local two-qudit gates using the\nassistance of entangled qubit pairs.

    "summary": "It is well known that a rotating superconductor produces a magnetic field\nproportional to its angular velocity. The authors conjectured earlier, that in\naddition to this so-called London moment, also a large gravitomagnetic field\nshould appear to explain an apparent mass increase of Niobium Cooper-pairs.\nThis phenomenon was indeed observed and induced acceleration fields outside the\nsuperconductor in the order of about 10^-4 g were found. The field appears to\nbe directly proportional to the applied angular acceleration of the\nsuperconductor following our theoretical motivations. If confirmed, a\ngravitomagnetic field of measurable magnitude was produced for the first time\nin a laboratory environment. These results may open up a new experimental\nwindow on testing general relativity and its consequences using coherent\nmatter.",

The\nbackground scattering lengths for 6Li and 40K have opposite signs, which lead\nto very different behaviors for these two types of atoms. For 40K, both the\ntwo-body and the many-body calculations show that the system always has two\nbranches of solutions: one corresponds to a deeply bound molecule state; and\nthe other, the one accessed by the current experiments, corresponds to a weakly\nbound state with population always dominantly in the open channel. For 6Li,\nthere is only a unique solution with the standard crossover from the weakly\nbound Cooper pairs to the deeply bound molecules as one sweeps the magnetic\nfield through the crossover region. Because of this difference, for the\nexperimentally accessible state of 40K, there is a quantum phase transition at\nzero temperature from the superfluid to the normal fermi gas at the positive\ndetuning of the magnetic field where the s-wave scattering length passes its\nzero point. For 6Li, however, the system changes continuously across the zero\npoint of the scattering length. For both types of atoms, we also give detailed\ncomparison between the results from the two-channel and the single-channel\nmodel over the whole region of the magnetic field detuning.",

    "summary": "Chandra X-ray observations revealed the presence of cold fronts (sharp\ncontact discontinuities between gas regions with different temperatures and\ndensities) in the centers of many, if not most, relaxed clusters with cool\ncores. We use high-resolution simulations of idealized cluster mergers to show\nthat they are due to sloshing of the cool gas in the central gravitational\npotential, which is easily set off by minor mergers and can persist for\ngigayears. The only necessary condition is a steep entropy profile, as observed\nin cooling flow clusters. Even if the infalling subcluster has no gas during\ncore passage, the gravitational disturbance sets the main mass peak (gas and\ndark matter together) in motion relative to the surrounding gas. A rapid change\nin the direction of motion causes a change in ram pressure, which pushes the\ncool gas away from the dark matter peak and triggers sloshing. For nonzero\nimpact parameters, the cool gas acquires angular momentum, resulting in a\ncharacteristic spiral pattern of cold fronts. There is little visible\ndisturbance outside the cool core in such a merger. If the subcluster retains\nits gas during core passage, the cool central gas of the main cluster is more\neasily decoupled from the dark matter peak. Subsequently, some of that gas, and\noften the cool gas from the subcluster, falls back to the center and starts\nsloshing. However, in such a merger, global disturbances are readily visible in\nX-rays for a long time. We conclude that cold fronts at the centers of relaxed\nclusters, often spiral or concentric-arc in shape, are probably caused by\nencounters with small subhalos stripped of all their gas at the early infall\nstages.",

    "summary": "We calculate the complete NNLO QCD corrections to the charm contribution of\nthe rare decay K+ -> pi+ nu nu-bar. We encounter several new features, which\nwere absent in lower orders. We discuss them in detail and present the results\nfor the 2-loop matching conditions of the Wilson coefficients, the 3-loop\nanomalous dimensions, and the 2-loop matrix elements of the relevant operators\nthat enter the NNLO renormalization group analysis of the Z-penguin and the\nelectroweak box contribution. The inclusion of the NNLO QCD corrections leads\nto a significant reduction of the theoretical uncertainty from 9.8% down to\n2.4% in the relevant parameter Pc, implying the leftover scale uncertainties in\nBR(K+ -> pi+ nu nu-bar) and in the determination of |V_td|, sin(2 beta), and\ngamma from the K -> pi nu nu system to be 1.3%, 1.0%, 0.006, and 1.2 degrees,\nrespectively. For the charm quark MSbar mass mc=(1.30+-0.05) GeV and |V_us|=\n0.2248 the NLO value Pc=0.37+-0.06 is modified to Pc=0.38+-0.04 at the NNLO\nlevel with the latter error fully dominated by the uncertainty in mc. We\npresent tables for Pc as a function of mc and alphas(MZ) and a very accurate\nanalytic formula that summarizes these two dependences as well as the dominant\ntheoretical uncertainties. Adding the recently calculated long-distance\ncontributions we find BR(K+ -> pi+ nu nu-bar)=(8.0+-1.1)*10^-11 with the\npresent uncertainties in mc and the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa elements being\nthe dominant individual sources in the quoted error. We also emphasize that\nimproved calculations of the long-distance contributions to K+ -> pi+ nu nu-bar\nand of the isospin breaking corrections in the evaluation of the weak current\nmatrix elements from K+ -> pi0 e+ nu would be valuable in order to increase the\npotential of the two golden K -> pi nu nu decays in the search for new physics.",

    "summary": "The evolution of negative streamers during electric breakdown of a\nnon-attaching gas can be described by a two-fluid model for electrons and\npositive ions. It consists of continuity equations for the charged particles\nincluding drift, diffusion and reaction in the local electric field, coupled to\nthe Poisson equation for the electric potential. The model generates field\nenhancement and steep propagating ionization fronts at the tip of growing\nionized filaments. An adaptive grid refinement method for the simulation of\nthese structures is presented. It uses finite volume spatial discretizations\nand explicit time stepping, which allows the decoupling of the grids for the\ncontinuity equations from those for the Poisson equation. Standard refinement\nmethods in which the refinement criterion is based on local error monitors fail\ndue to the pulled character of the streamer front that propagates into a\nlinearly unstable state. We present a refinement method which deals with all\nthese features. Tests on one-dimensional streamer fronts as well as on\nthree-dimensional streamers with cylindrical symmetry (hence effectively 2D for\nnumerical purposes) are carried out successfully. Results on fine grids are\npresented, they show that such an adaptive grid method is needed to capture the\nstreamer characteristics well. This refinement strategy enables us to\nadequately compute negative streamers in pure gases in the parameter regime\nwhere a physical instability appears: branching streamers.",

In this study, we explore the analogous relationship between MBH,\nderived using the virial method, and the stellar R-band bulge luminosity (Lr)\nor stellar bulge mass (M*) at epochs of 1 < z < 4.5 using a sample of 31\ngravitationally lensed AGNs and 20 non-lensed AGNs. At redshifts z > 1.7\n(10--12 Gyrs ago), we find that the observed MBH--Lr relation is nearly the\nsame (to within ~0.3 mag) as it is today. When the observed Lr are corrected\nfor luminosity evolution, this means that the black holes grew in mass faster\nthan their hosts, with the MBH/M* mass ratio being a factor of > 4(+2)(-1)\ntimes larger at z > 1.7 than it is today. By the redshift range 1<z<1.7 (8-10\nGyrs ago), the MBH/M* ratio is at most two times higher than today, but it may\nbe consistent with no evolution. Combining the results, we conclude that the\nratio MBH/M* rises with look-back time, although it may saturate at ~6 times\nthe local value. Scenarios in which moderately luminous quasar hosts at z>1.7\nwere fully formed bulges that passively faded to the present epoch are ruled\nout.",

The simulations achieve\nhigh spatial and mass resolution and include radiative cooling, star formation,\nand other processes accompanying galaxy formation. Our analysis shows that\nsimulated clusters exhibit a high degree of regularity and tight correlations\nbetween the considered observables and total mass. The normalizations of the\nM-Tx, Mg-Tx, and M-Yx relations agree to better than 10-15% with the current\nobservational measurements of these relations. Our results show that Yx is the\nbest mass proxy with a remarkably low scatter of only ~5-7% in M500 for a fixed\nYx, at both low and high redshifts and regardless of whether clusters are\nrelaxed or not. In addition, we show that redshift evolution of the Yx-M500\nrelation is close to the self-similar prediction, which makes Yx a very\nattractive mass indicator for measurements of the cluster mass function from\nX-ray selected samples.",

We find no significant evidence for a\ntime-varying dark energy density or for non-zero mean curvature. Although by\nsome measure the limits on four of the time-varying mode amplitudes are quite\ntight, they are consistent with the expectation that the dark energy density\ndoes not vary on timescales shorter than a Hubble time.

On these scales the effective index of the power spectrum\napproaches -3, and a range of mass scales collapse almost simultaneously.\nCompared to a z=0 galaxy cluster substructure within our SUSY host is less\nevident both in phase-space and in physical space, and it is less resistant\nagainst tidal disruption. As the universe expands by a factor of 1.3, we find\nthat between 20 and 40 percent of well-resolved SUSY substructure is destroyed,\ncompared to only about 1 percent in the low-redshift cluster. Nevertheless SUSY\nsubstructure is just as abundant as in z=0 galaxy clusters, i.e. the normalized\nmass and circular velocity functions are very similar. The dark matter\nself-annihilation gamma-ray luminosity from bound subhalos and other deviations\nfrom a smooth spherical configuration is at least comparable to the\nspherically-averaged signal in the SUSY host, and at least three times larger\nthan the spherically-averaged signal in the cluster host.

    "summary": "Single-molecule transistors provide a unique experimental tool to investigate\nthe coupling between charge transport and the molecular degrees of freedom in\nindividual molecules. One interesting class of molecules for such experiments\nare the single-molecule magnets, since the intramolecular exchange forces\npresent in these molecules should couple strongly to the spin of transport\nelectrons, thereby providing both new mechanisms for modulating electron flow\nand also new means for probing nanoscale magnetic excitations. Here we report\nsingle-molecule transistor measurements on devices incorporating Mn12\nmolecules. By studying the electron-tunneling spectrum as a function of\nmagnetic field, we are able to identify clear signatures of magnetic states and\ntheir associated magnetic anisotropy. A comparison of the data to simulations\nalso suggests that electron flow can strongly enhance magnetic relaxation of\nthe magnetic molecule.",

Because the\ncharacteristics always coincide with geodesics and can always be specified by\nconstants, direct integration of the characteristics derived from the transfer\nequation as commonly done in 1-D applications is not required. The\ncharacteristics are known for a specified metric from the geodesics. We give\ndetails in both flat and static spherically symmetric spacetimes.

It is shown that the K-conserving\nderivative formula is the one that yields no effect of K-conservation on the\ndifferentiation of K-independent functionals, which gives the basis for its\ngeneralization for multiple constraints. Connections with the derivative with\nrespect to the shape of the functional variable and with the shape-conserving\nderivative, together with their use in the density-functional theory of\nmany-electron systems, are discussed. Yielding an intuitive interpretation of\nK-conserving functional derivatives, it is also shown that K-conserving\nderivatives emerge as directional derivatives along K-conserving paths, which\nis achieved via a generalization of the Gateaux derivative for that kind of\npaths.

    "summary": "(Abridged) The ACS Virgo Cluster Survey is an HST program to obtain\nhigh-resolution, g and z-band images for 100 early-type members of the Virgo\nCluster, spanning a range of ~460 in blue luminosity. Based on this large,\nhomogeneous dataset, we present a sharp upward revision in the frequency of\nnucleation in early-type galaxies brighter than M_B ~ -15 (66 < f_n < 82%), and\nfind no evidence for nucleated dwarfs to be more concentrated to the center of\nVirgo than their non-nucleated counterparts. Resolved stellar nuclei are not\npresent in galaxies brighter than M_B ~ -20.5, however, there is no clear\nevidence from the properties of the nuclei, or from the overall incidence of\nnucleation, for a change at M_B ~ -17.6, the traditional dividing point between\ndwarf and giant galaxies. On average, nuclei are ~3.5 mag brighter than a\ntypical globular cluster and have a median half-light radius ~4.2 pc. Nuclear\nluminosities correlate with nuclear sizes and, in galaxies fainter than M_B ~\n-17.6, nuclear colors. Comparing the nuclei to the \"nuclear clusters\" found in\nlate-type spiral galaxies reveals a close match in terms of size, luminosity\nand overall frequency, pointing to a formation mechanism that is rather\ninsensitive to the detailed properties of the host galaxy. The mean\nnuclear-to-galaxy luminosity ratio is indistinguishable from the mean\nSBH-to-bulge mass ratio, calculated in early-type galaxies with detected\nsupermassive black holes (SBHs). We argue that compact stellar nuclei might be\nthe low-mass counterparts of the SBHs detected in the bright galaxies, and that\none should think in terms of \"Central Massive Objects\" -- either SBHs or\ncompact stellar nuclei -- that accompany the formation of almost all early-type\ngalaxies and contain a mean fraction ~0.3% of the total bulge mass.",

This prior is found to provide a consistent estimate of the\nregression function in the $\\L^p$ topology, for any $1 \\leq p < \\infty$, and\nfor arbitrary measurable $f_0:[0,1] \\to [0,1]$. A Markov chain Monte Carlo\n(MCMC) implementation is outlined and analyzed.

A striking resemblance between the posterior mean\nestimate and the bagged CART estimate is noted and discussed.

    "summary": "We measure the conductance of amine-terminated molecules by breaking Au point\ncontacts in a molecular solution at room temperature. We find that the\nvariability of the observed conductance for the diamine molecule-Au junctions\nis much less than the variability for diisonitrile and dithiol-Au junctions.\nThis narrow distribution enables unambiguous conductance measurements of single\nmolecules. For an alkane diamine series with 2-8 carbon atoms in the\nhydrocarbon chain, our results show a systematic trend in the conductance from\nwhich we extract a tunneling decay constant of 0.91 +/- 0.03 per methylene\ngroup. We hypothesize that the diamine link binds preferentially to\nundercoordinated Au atoms in the junction. This is supported by density\nfunctional theory-based calculations that show the amine binding to a gold\nadatom with sufficient angular flexibility for easy junction formation but\nwell-defined electronic coupling of the N lone pair to the Au. Therefore, the\namine linkage leads to well-defined conductance measurements of a single\nmolecule junction in a statistical study.",

The conceptually novel design of the apparatus for the\nproduction of BECs features nested vacuum chambers and an in-vacuo magnetic\ntransport configuration. It grants large scale spatial access to the BEC for\nsamples and probes via a modular and exchangeable \"science platform\". We are\nable to produce \\87Rb condensates of five million atoms and to output couple\ncontinuous atom lasers. The cavity is mounted on the science platform on top of\na vibration isolation system. The optical cavity works in the strong coupling\nregime of cavity quantum electrodynamics and serves as a quantum optical\ndetector for single atoms. This system enables us to study atom optics on a\nsingle particle level and to further develop the field of quantum atom optics.\nWe describe the technological modules and the operation of the combined BEC\ncavity apparatus. Its performance is characterized by single atom detection\nmeasurements for thermal and quantum degenerate atomic beams. The atom laser\nprovides a fast and controllable supply of atoms coupling with the cavity mode\nand allows for an efficient study of atom field interactions in the strong\ncoupling regime. Moreover, the high detection efficiency for quantum degenerate\natoms distinguishes the cavity as a sensitive and weakly invasive probe for\ncold atomic clouds.",

We focus on\nclouds smaller than 1pc, which corresponds to tiny HI clouds recently\ndiscovered by Braun & Kanekar and Stanimirovi{\\'c} & Heiles. By performing\none-dimensional spherically symmetric numerical simulations of the two-phase\ninterstellar medium (ISM), we derive the timescales as a function of the cloud\nsize and of pressure of the ambient warm medium. We find that the evaporation\ntimescale of the clouds of 0.01 pc is about 1Myr with standard ISM pressure,\n$p/k_{B}\\sim 10^{3.5}$ K cm$^{-3}$, and for clouds larger than about 0.1 pc it\ndepends strongly on the pressure. In high pressure cases, there exists a\ncritical radius for clouds growing as a function of pressure, but the minimum\ncritical size is $\\sim$ 0.03 pc for a standard environment. If tiny HI clouds\nexist ubiquitously, our analysis suggests two implications: tiny HI clouds are\nformed continuously with the timescale of 1Myr, or the ambient pressure around\nthe clouds is much higher than the standard ISM pressure. We also find that the\nresults agree well with those obtained by assuming quasi-steady state\nevolution. The cloud-size dependence of the timescale is well explained by an\nanalytic approximate formula derived by Nagashima, Koyama & Inutsuka. We also\ncompare it with the evaporation rate given by McKee & Cowie.",

Core levels and the O 2$p$\nvalence band in Sm$_{2-x}$Ca$_x$Ru$_2$O$_7$ show almost the same amount of\nmonotonous upward energy shifts with Ca concentration, which indicates that the\nchemical potential is shifted downward due to hole doping.

The core levels\nin Sm$_{2-x}$Bi$_x$Ru$_2$O$_7$, on the other hand, do not show clear energy\nshifts except for the Ru 3$d$ core level, whose line shape change also reflects\nthe increase of metallic screening with Bi concentration.

    "summary": "We summarize some recent results on the metallicity and dust properties of\nActive Galactic Nuclei (AGN) at high redshift (1<z<6.4). By using the spectra\nof more than 5000 QSOs from the SDSS we find no evidence for any metallicity\nevolution in the redshift range 2<z<4.5, while there is a significant\nluminosity-metallicity dependence. These results are confirmed by the spectra\nof a smaller sample of narrow line AGNs at high-z (QSO2s and radio galaxies).\nThe lack of metallicity evolution is interpreted both as a consequence of the\ncosmic downsizing and as a selection effect resulting from the joint QSO-galaxy\nevolution. The luminosity-metallicity relation is interpreted as a consequence\nof the mass-metallicity relation in the host galaxies of QSOs, but a\nrelationship with the accretion rate is also possible. The lack of metallicity\nevolution is observed even in the spectra of the most distant QSOs known (z~6).\nThis result is particularly surprising for elements such as Fe, C and Si, which\nare subject to a delayed enrichment, and requires that the hosts of these QSOs\nformed in short bursts and at very high redshift (z>10). The properties of dust\nin high-z QSOs are discussed within the context of the dust production\nmechanisms in the early universe. The dust extinction curve is observed to\nevolve beyond z>4, and by z~6 it is well described by the properties expected\nfor dust produced by SNe, suggesting that the latter is the main mechanism of\ndust production in the early universe. We also show that the huge dust masses\nobserved in distant QSOs can be accounted for by SN dust within the\nobservational constraints currently available. Finally, we show that QSO winds,\nwhich have been proposed as an alternative mechanism of dust production, may\nalso contribute significantly to the total dust budget at high redshift.",

Combined with the mass ratio, this constrains the pulsar\nmass to Mpsr=1.40^+0.16_-0.10 Msun. If we instead use the white-dwarf spectrum\nand the distance of NGC 6752 to determine the white-dwarf radius, we find\nRwd=0.058+-0.004 Rsun. For the observed temperature, the mass-radius relations\npredict a white-dwarf mass of Mwd=0.175+-0.010 Msun, constraining the pulsar\nmass to Mpsr=1.34+-0.08 Msun. We find that the white-dwarf radius determined\nfrom the spectrum and the systemic radial velocity of the binary are only\nmarginally consistent with the values that are expected if PSR J1911-5958A is\nassociated with NGC 6752. We discuss possible causes to explain this\ninconsistency, but conclude that our observations do not conclusively confirm\nnor disprove the assocation of the pulsar binary with the globular cluster.",

The sample is composed of 13 blazars (6\nBL Lac and 7 Flat-Spectrum Radio Quasar) and 2 radio galaxies, that are\nassociated with detections at energies >100 MeV. The data for 7 of them are\nanalyzed here for the first time, including the first X-ray observation of PKS\n1406-706. Then, the spectral characteristics of the sources in the present\nsample have been compared with those in previous catalogs of blazars and other\nAGN, in order to search for any difference or long term change. All the\nselected sources appear to follow the classic \"blazar sequence\" and the\nspectral energy distributions (SED) built with the present X-ray and optical/UV\ndata and completed with historical data, confirm the findings of previous\nstudies on this type of sources. Some sources display interesting features\nworth noting: four of them, namely AO 0235+164, PKS 1127-145, S5 0836+710 and\nPKS 1830-211 show the presence of an intervening absorption system along the\nline of sight, but only the latter is known to be surely gravitationally\nlensed. AO 0235+164 was detected during an outburst and its SED shows a clear\nshift of the synchrotron peak. 3C 273 shows a change in the state with respect\nto the previous BeppoSAX observations, that can be interpreted as an increase\nof the Seyfert-like component and a corresponding decline of the jet emission.\nThis is consistent with the monitoring at radio wavelengths performed during\nthe same years. PKS 1406-706 is detected with a flux higher than in the past,\nbut with a corresponding low optical flux. Moreover, although it is classified\nas FSRQ, the SED can be modelled with a simple synchrotron self-Compton model.",

A\nperturbed Boussinesq equation of the form $y_{tt}-y_{xx} -\\epsilon^2(y_{xxtt} +\n(y^2)_{xx})+ \\epsilon^3(y_{xxt}+y_{xxxxt} + (y^2)_{xxt}) =0 $ which includes\ninstability and dissipation is derived from this system.",

This heuristic approach does not provide theoretical\nsupport for the electrooptic flat-top-pulse generation reported recently. Here,\nwe perform a waveform synthesis in terms of the Fresnel images of the\nperiodically phase-modulated input light. In particular, we demonstrate\nflat-top-pulse generation with a duty ratio of 50% at a quarter of the Talbot\ncondition for the sinusoidal phase modulation.

This correlation\nsuggests both that the main determinant of the bid-ask spread is adverse\nselection, and that most of the volatilitycomes from trade impact.

The flow is necessarily turbulent,\nthat is, may be considered as a mean flow and a superimposed turbulence. In\nthis paper the induction processes of the turbulence are investigated within\nthe framework of mean--field electrodynamics. They imply of course a part which\nleads to an enhanced dissipation of the mean magnetic field. As a consequence\nof the helical mean flow there are also helical structures in the turbulence.\nThey lead to some kind of $\\alpha$--effect, which might basically support the\nscrew dynamo. The peculiarity of this $\\alpha$--effect explains measurements\nmade at a smaller version of the device envisaged for the dynamo experiment.\nThe helical structures of the turbulence lead also to other effects, which in\ncombination with a rotational shear are potentially capable of dynamo action. A\npart of them can basically support the screw dynamo. Under the conditions of\nthe experiment all induction effects of the turbulence prove to be rather weak\nin comparison to that of the main flow. Numerical solutions of the mean--field\ninduction equation show that all the induction effects of the turbulence\ntogether let the screw dynamo threshold slightly, at most by one per cent,\nrise. The numerical results give also some insights into the action of the\nindividual induction effects of the turbulence.",

Using the Chandra ACIS, we are able to clearly\nresolve the two active galactic nuclei in 3C 75, the well known double radio\nsource at the centre of Abell 400. Through analysis of the new Chandra\nobservation of Abell 400 along with 4.5 GHz and 330 MHz VLA radio data, we will\nshow new evidence that the Active Galactic Nuclei in 3C 75 are a bound system.\nMethods. Using the high quality X-ray data, we map the temperature, pressure,\ndensity, and entropy of the inner regions as well as the cluster profile\nproperties out to ~18'. We compare features in the X-ray and radio images to\ndetermine the interaction between the intra-cluster medium and extended radio\nemission. The Chandra image shows an elongation of the cluster gas along the\nnortheast-southwest axis; aligned with the initial bending of 3C 75's jets.\nAdditionally, the temperature profile shows no cooling core, consistent with a\nmerging system. There is an apparent shock to the south of the core consistent\nwith a Mach number of M~1.4 or speed of v~1200 km s^-1. Both Active Galactic\nNuclei, at least in projection, are located in the low entropy, high density\ncore just north of the shock region. We find that the projected path of the\njets does not follow the intra-cluster medium surface brightness gradient as\nexpected if their path were due to buoyancy. We also find that both central AGN\nare extended and include a thermal component. Based on this analysis, we\nconclude that the Active Galactic Nuclei in 3C 75 are a bound system from a\nprevious merger. They are contained in a low entropy core moving through the\nintra-cluster medium at 1200 km s^-1. The bending of the jets is due to the\nlocal intra-cluster medium wind.",

A survey of such remote quadrupole\nmeasurements provides information about large-scale cosmological perturbations.\nThis paper presents a formalism for calculating the correlation function of\nremote quadrupole measurements in spherical harmonic space. The number of\nindependent modes probed by both single-redshift and volume-limited surveys is\npresented, along with the length scales probed by these modes. In a remote\nquadrupole survey sparsely covering a large area of sky, the largest-scale\nmodes probe the same length scales as the quadrupole but with much narrower\nFourier-space window functions. The largest-scale modes are significantly\ncorrelated with the local CMB, but even when this correlation is projected out\nthe largest remaining modes probe gigaparsec scales (comparable to the CMB at\nl=2-10) with narrow window functions. These modes may provide insight into the\npossible anomalies in the large-scale CMB anisotropy. At fixed redshift, the\ndata from such a survey form an E-type spin-2 field on the sphere to a good\napproximation; the near-absence of B modes will provide a valuable check on\nsystematic errors. A survey of only a few low-redshift clusters allows an\nindependent reconstruction of the five coefficients of the local CMB\nquadrupole, providing a test for contamination in the WMAP quadrupole.

    "summary": "Assuming that $(X_t)_{t\\in\\Z}$ is a vector valued time series with a common\nmarginal distribution admitting a density $f$, our aim is to provide a wide\nrange of consistent estimators of $f$. We consider different methods of\nestimation of the density as kernel, projection or wavelets ones. Various cases\nof weakly dependent series are investigated including the Doukhan & Louhichi\n(1999)'s $\\eta$-weak dependence condition, and the $\\tilde \\phi$-dependence of\nDedecker & Prieur (2005). We thus obtain results for Markov chains, dynamical\nsystems, bilinear models, non causal Moving Average... From a moment inequality\nof Doukhan & Louhichi (1999), we provide convergence rates of the term of error\nfor the estimation with the $\\L^q$ loss or almost surely, uniformly on compact\nsubsets.",

    "summary": "We investigate the effect of a geometric inconsistency in the calculation of\nsynthetic spectra of giant stars. Spectra computed with model atmospheres\ncalculated in spherical geometry while using the plane-parallel approximation\nfor line formation calculations (s_p), as well as the fully plane-parallel case\n(p_p), are compared to the consistently spherical case (s_s). We present\nabundance differences for solar metallicity models with Teff ranging from 4000\nto 6500 K and logg from 0.5 to 3.0 [cgs]. The effects are smaller for s_p\ncalculations (-0.1 dex in the worst case) than for the p_p case (up to +0.35\ndex for minority species and at most -0.04 dex for majority species), both with\nrespect to the s_s case. In the s_p case the differences increase slightly with\ntemperature, while in the p_p case they show a more complex behaviour. In both\ncases the effects decrease with increasing logg and increase with equivalent\nwidth. Thus, within the parameter range of F, G and K giants, consistency seems\nto be less important than using a spherical model atmosphere. The abundance\ndifferences due to sphericity effects presented here can be used for error\nestimation in abundance studies relying on plane-parallel modelling.",

We discuss possible causes for this phenomenon, which\nis difficult to explain in view of current models of Be star disks. The 2001\nspectral energy distribution and polarization are succesfully modeled with a\nthree-dimensional non-LTE Monte Carlo code which produces a self-consistent\ndetermination of the hydrogen level populations, electron temperature, and gas\ndensity for hot star disks. Our disk model is hydrostatically supported in the\nvertical direction and radially controlled by viscosity. Such a disk model has,\nessentially, only two free parameters, viz., the equatorial mass loss rate and\nthe disk outer radius.

    "summary": "The main uncertainty in current determinations of the power spectrum\nnormalization, sigma_8, from abundances of X-ray luminous galaxy clusters\narises from the calibration of the mass-temperature relation. We use our weak\nlensing mass determinations of 30 clusters from the hitherto largest sample of\nclusters with lensing masses, combined with X-ray temperature data from the\nliterature, to calibrate the normalization of this relation at a temperature of\n8 keV, M_{500c,8 keV}=(8.7 +/- 1.6) h^{-1} 10^{14} M_sun. This normalization is\nconsistent with previous lensing-based results based on smaller cluster\nsamples, and with some predictions from numerical simulations, but higher than\nmost normalizations based on X-ray derived cluster masses. Assuming the\ntheoretically expected slope alpha=3/2 of the mass-temperature relation, we\nderive sigma_8 = 0.88 +/-0.09 for a spatially-flat LambdaCDM universe with\nOmega_m = 0.3. The main systematic errors on the lensing masses result from\nextrapolating the cluster masses beyond the field-of-view used for the\ngravitational lensing measurements, and from the separation of\ncluster/background galaxies, contributing each with a scatter of 20%. Taking\nthis into account, there is still significant intrinsic scatter in the\nmass-temperature relation indicating that this relation may not be very tight,\nat least at the high mass end. Furthermore, we find that dynamically relaxed\nclusters are 75 +/-40% hotter than non-relaxed clusters.",

However, in most of the NMSSM parameter space the configurations of\nthe non-minimal model are not very different from those arising in the minimal\ncase.",

If the parent is a main-sequence star, it has mass M~0.5\nM_sun implying a planet mass of ~13 M_earth and projected separation of ~2.7\nAU. When intensely monitored over their peak, high-magnification events similar\nto OGLE-2005-BLG-169 have nearly complete sensitivity to Neptune mass-ratio\nplanets with projected separations of 0.6 to 1.6 Einstein radii, corresponding\nto 1.6--4.3 AU in the present case. Only two other such events were monitored\nwell enough to detect Neptunes, and so this detection by itself suggests that\nNeptune mass-ratio planets are common. Moreover, another Neptune was recently\ndiscovered at a similar distance from its parent star in a low-magnification\nevent, which are more common but are individually much less sensitive to\nplanets. Combining the two detections yields 90% upper and lower frequency\nlimits f=0.37^{+0.30}_{-0.21} over just 0.4 decades of planet-star separation.\nIn particular, f>16% at 90% confidence. The parent star hosts no Jupiter-mass\ncompanions with projected separations within a factor 5 of that of the detected\nplanet. The lens-source relative proper motion is \\mu~7--10 mas/yr, implying\nthat if the lens is sufficiently bright, I<23.8, it will be detectable by HST\nby 3 years after peak. This would permit a more precise estimate of the lens\nmass and distance, and so the mass and projected separation of the planet.\nAnalogs of OGLE-2005-BLG-169Lb orbiting nearby stars would be difficult to\ndetect by other methods of planet detection, including radial velocities,\ntransits, or astrometry.",

The time series theta_0(t) consisted\nof meanderings similar to a diffusive process, but in addition contained large\nand irregular spontaneous reorientation events through angles Delta theta. We\nfound that reorientations can occur by two distinct mechanisms. One consists of\na rotation of the circulation plane without any major reduction of the\ncirculation strength. The other involves a cessation of the circulation,\nfollowed by a restart in a randomly chosen new direction. Rotations occurred an\norder of magnitude more frequently than cessations. Rotations occurred with a\nmonotonically decreasing probability distribution p(Delta theta), i.e. there\nwas no dominant value of Delta theta and small Delta theta were more common\nthan large ones. For cessations p(Delta theta) was uniform, suggesting that\ninformation of theta_0(t) before the cessation is lost. Both rotations and\ncessations have Poissonian statistics in time, and can occur at any theta_0.\nThe average azimuthal rotation rate increased as the circulation strength of\nthe LSC decreased. Tilting the sample relative to gravity significantly reduced\nthe frequency of occurrence of both rotations and cessations.",

These effects, which do not require an applied magnetic field, can\noriginate in a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic spin-orbit coupling\nmechanisms and depend on geometry, dimension, impurity scattering, and carrier\ndensity of the system--making the analysis of these effects a diverse field of\nresearch. In this article, we give an overview of the theoretical background of\nthe spin Hall effects and summarize some of the most important results. First,\nwe explain effective spin-orbit Hamiltonians, how they arise from band\nstructure, and how they can be understood from symmetry considerations;\nincluding intrinsic coupling due to bulk inversion or structure asymmetry or\ndue to strain, and extrinsic coupling due to impurities. This leads to\ndifferent mechanisms of spin transport: spin precession, skew scattering, and\nside jump. Then we present the kinetic (Boltzmann) equations, which describe\nthe spin-dependent distribution function of charge carriers, and the diffusion\nequation for spin polarization density. Next, we define the notion of spin\ncurrents and discuss their relation to spin polarization. Finally, we explain\nthe electrically induced spin effects; namely, spin polarization and currents\nin bulk and near boundaries (the focus of most current theoretical research\nefforts), and spin injection, as well as effects in mesoscopic systems and in\nedge states.",

The theory accurately\ndescribes detailed features of the effective attraction between two equally\ncharged walls at strong coupling and intermediate separations of the walls.

We\nshow that, while $H_{\\rm c2}(0)$ exceeds a simple spin-singlet paramagnetic\nlimit $H_{\\rm P}$, it is well below an $H_{\\rm P}$ enhanced due to the missing\nspatial inversion symmetry reported recently in KOs$_2$O$_6$, ensuring that the\npair-breaking here is executed by orbital degrees. {\\it Ab initio} calculations\nof orbital $H_{\\rm c2}$ show that the unusual temperature dependence is\nreproduced if dominant s-wave superconductivity resides on the smaller closed\nFermi surfaces.",

These include the observed\noverabundance of point X-ray sources at the Galactic center, the prediction of\nrates and characteristics of tidal disruptions of extended stars by the MBH and\nof inspirals of compact stars into the MBH, the latter being events of high\nimportance for the future space borne gravitational wave interferometer LISA.\nIn relatively small galactic nuclei, hosting MBHs with masses in the range\n10^5-10^7 Msun, the single most important dynamical process is 2-body\nrelaxation. It induces the formation of a steep density cusp around the MBH and\nstrong mass segregation, as more massive stars lose energy to lighter ones and\ndrift to the central regions. Using a spherical stellar dynamical Monte-Carlo\ncode, we simulate the long-term relaxational evolution of galactic nucleus\nmodels with a spectrum of stellar masses. Our focus is the concentration of\nstellar black holes to the immediate vicinity of the MBH. We quantify this mass\nsegregation for a variety of galactic nucleus models and discuss its\nastrophysical implications. Special attention is given to models developed to\nmatch the conditions in the Milky Way nucleus; we examine the presence of\ncompact objects in connection to recent high-resolution X-ray observations.",

    "summary": "Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the alignment of grains with\nthe interstellar magnetic field, including paramagnetic dissipation, radiative\ntorques, and supersonic gas-grain streaming. These must compete with\ndisaligning processes, including randomly directed torques arising from\ncollisions with gas atoms. I describe a novel disalignment mechanism for grains\nthat have a time-varying electric dipole moment and that drift across the\nmagnetic field. Depending on the drift speed, this mechanism may yield a much\nshorter disalignment timescale than that associated with random gas atom\nimpacts. For suprathermally rotating grains, the new disaligning process may be\nmore potent for carbonaceous dust than for silicate dust. This could result in\nefficient alignment for silicate grains but poor alignment for carbonaceous\ngrains.",

We achieve a correct description of fermion masses and mixing\nangles by describing first and second generations as bulk fields, and by\nembedding the third generation into four multiplets located at the Pati-Salam\nbrane. The Yukawa sector is simple and compact and predicts a neutrino spectrum\nof normal hierarchy type. Concerning proton decay, dimension five operators are\nabsent and the essentially unique localization of matter multiplets implies\nthat the minimal couplings between the super-heavy gauge bosons and matter\nfields are vanishing. Non-minimal interactions are allowed but the resulting\ndimension six operators describing proton decay are too suppressed to produce\nobservable effects, even in future, super-massive detectors.",

The resolved X-ray emission line profiles\nprovide information about the shocked, hot gas which emits the X-radiation, and\nabout the bulk of comparably cool stellar wind material which partly absorbs\nthis radiation. In this paper, we synthesize X-ray line profiles with a model\nof a clumpy stellar wind. We find that the geometrical shape of the wind\ninhomogeneities is important: better agreement with the observations can be\nachieved with radially compressed clumps than with spherical clumps. The\nparameters of the model, i.e. chemical abundances, stellar radius, mass-loss\nrate and terminal wind velocity, are taken from existing analyses of UV and\noptical spectra of the programme stars. On this basis, we also calculate the\ncontinuum-absorption coefficient of the cool-wind material, using the Potsdam\nWolf-Rayet (PoWR) model atmosphere code. The radial location of X-ray emitting\ngas is restricted from analysing the fir line ratios of helium-like ions. The\nonly remaining free parameter of our model is the typical distance between the\nclumps; here, we assume that at any point in the wind there is one clump\npassing by per one dynamical time-scale of the wind. The total emission in a\nmodel line is scaled to the observation. There is a good agreement between\nsynthetic and observed line profiles. We conclude that the X-ray emission line\nprofiles in O stars can be explained by hot plasma embedded in a cool wind\nwhich is highly clumped in the form of radially compressed shell fragments.",

Sharp velocity gradients are apparent across the ridges.\nAnalyses of the CO data and the newborn stellar clusters revealed in HST images\nindicate the existence of unresolved molecular clouds with masses of\n10^4-6Msun. The observed shear velocity gradient across the ridges is too small\nto break up giant molecular clouds. Therefore, the clouds are likely to survive\npassage through the ridges. We discuss a cloud orbit model in a bar potential.\nThe model reproduces the narrow offset ridges and sharp velocity gradients\nacross the ridges in NGC 4303. We discuss cloud-cloud collisions (and close\ninteractions) as a possible triggering mechanism for star formation. The\nnewborn stellar clusters in NGC 4303 are located predominantly at the leading\nsides of the offset ridges, where cloud orbits are densely populated and\nsuggest a high collisional frequency and possibly a high rate of triggered star\nformation. Cloud-based dynamics is less dissipative than smooth hydrodynamic\nmodels, possibly extending the timescales of gas dynamical evolution and gas\nfueling to central regions in barred galaxies.",

The choice of the boundary term is justified on the grounds\nthat an enhanced 'almost off-shell' local AdS/Conformal symmetry arises for\nthat very special choice. One may say that the boundary term is dictated by a\nguiding symmetry principle. Two sets of boundary conditions are considered,\nwhich yield regularization procedures analogous to (but different from) the\nstandard 'background substraction' and 'counterterms' regularization methods.\nThe Noether charges are constructed in general.

If $m^{}_3$ vanishes, we find that the one-loop\nrenormalization-group equation (RGE) of $\\delta$ does not diverge and its\nrunning has no quasi-fixed point. When $m^{}_3 \\neq 0$ holds, we show that the\ncontinuity condition derived by Antusch {\\it et al} is always valid, no matter\nwhether the $\\tau$-dominance approximation is taken or not. The RGE running of\n$\\delta$ undergoes a quasi-fixed point determined by a nontrivial input of\n$\\alpha^{}_2$ in the limit $m^{}_1 \\to 0$. If three neutrino masses are nearly\ndegenerate, it is also possible to arrive at a quasi-fixed point in the RGE\nevolution of $\\delta$ from the electroweak scale to the seesaw scale or vice\nversa. Furthermore, the continuity condition and the quasi-fixed point of\nCP-violating phases in another useful parametrization are briefly discussed.",

A 4-vector force has 4 components, because of the orthogonality of\n4-vector force and 4-vector velocity, the number of independent components of\nthe force reduces to 3, while the electromagnetic force can merely provide 2\nindependent components, this situation means that there is an undefined\ncomponent accompanying the electromagnetic force.

We detected strong NaI D 5891,5897\ndoublet absorption in high-redshift DLAs at z=1.062 and 1.181, confirming the\npresence of NaI, which was first reported for the rest-frame UV NaI\n3303.3,3303.9 doublet by Petitjean et al. This is the first detection of NaI D\nabsorption in a high-redshift (z>1) DLA. In addition, we detected a new NaI\ncomponent in the z=1.062 DLA and four new components in the z=1.181 DLA. Using\nan empirical relationship between NaI and HI column density, we found that all\n\"components\" have large HI column density, so that each component is classified\nas DLA absorption. We also detected strong NaI D absorption associated with a\nMgII system at z=1.173. Because no other metal absorption lines were detected\nin this system at the velocity of the NaI absorption in previously reported\noptical spectra (observed 3.6 years ago), we interpret this NaI absorption\ncloud probably appeared in the line of sight toward the QSO after the optical\nobservation. This newly found cloud is likely to be a DLA based upon its large\nestimated HI column density. We found that the N(NaI)/N(CaII) ratios in these\nDLAs are systematically smaller than those observed in the Galaxy; they are\nmore consistent with the ratios seen in the Large Magellanic Cloud. This is\nconsistent with dust depletion generally being smaller in lower metallicity\nenvironments. However, all five clouds of the z=1.181 system have a high\nN(NaI)/N(CaII) ratio, which is characteristic of cold dense gas.

Starting from pure monomers, three eras of transient nucleation are\ncharacterized in the classic Becker-D\\\"oring kinetic equations with the\nTurnbull-Fisher discrete diffusivity. After an initial stage in which the\nnumber of monomers decreases, many clusters of small size are produced and a\ncontinuous size distribution is created. During the second era, nucleii are\nincreasing steadily in size in such a way that their distribution appears as a\nwave front advancing towards the critical size for steady nucleation. The\nnucleation rate at critical size is negligible during this era. After the wave\nfront reaches critical size, it ignites the creation of supercritical clusters\nat a rate that increases monotonically until its steady value is reached.\nAnalytical formulas for the transient nucleation rate and the time lag are\nobtained that improve classical ones and compare very well with direct\nnumerical solutions. In addition, we propose and solve numerically a modified\nBecker-D\\\"oring model having a discrete diffusivity proportional to the area of\na spherical cluster with $k$ monomers for small $k$ (as in the Turnbull-Fisher\ncase) and to the cluster radius for large $k$ (as in the case of diffusive\ngrowth of clusters).",

This\nstudy included core/shell CdSe/ZnSe NRs and core NRs with two different surface\nligands producing different degrees of surface passivation. We compare the\nfindings for NRs to our measurements of blinking statistics from spherical CdSe\ncore and CdSe/ZnS core/shell nanocrystals (NCs). We find that for both NRs and\nspherical NCs, the off-time probability distributions are well described by a\npower law, while the on-time probability distributions are best described by a\ntruncated power law. The measured crossover time is indistinguishable within\nexperimental uncertainty for core and core/shell NRs, and for core NRs with\ndifferent ligands, indicating that surface passivation does not affect the\nblinking statistics significantly. We find that at fixed excitation intensity,\nthe inverse crossover time increases approximately linearly with increasing NR\naspect ratio; for a given sample, the inverse crossover time increases very\ngradually with increasing excitation intensity. The measured per-particle\nabsorption cross section for all samples indicates that the change in NR\nabsorption cross-section with sample size can account for some but not all of\nthe differences in crossover time. This suggests that the degree of quantum\nconfinement may be partially responsible for the aspect ratio dependence of the\ncrossover time.",

Based on the principle of structural-risk\nminimization, SVMs learn from examples in the existing database of a given\nproperty $Y$, automatically and optimally identify a set of ``support vectors''\ncorresponding to representative nuclei in the training set, and approximate the\nmapping $(Z,N) \\to Y$ in terms of these nuclei.

Indirect evidence comes from high pulsar\nvelocities, associations of supernovae with long-soft gamma-ray bursts, and\nasymmetries in late-time emission-line profiles. Spectropolarimetry provides a\ndirect probe of young supernova geometry, with higher polarization generally\nindicating a greater departure from spherical symmetry. Large polarizations\nhave been measured for 'stripped-envelope' (that is, type Ic) supernovae, which\nconfirms their non-spherical morphology; but the explosions of massive stars\nwith intact hydrogen envelopes (type II-P supernovae) have shown only weak\npolarizations at the early times observed. Here we report multi-epoch\nspectropolarimetry of a classic type II-P supernova that reveals the abrupt\nappearance of significant polarization when the inner core is first exposed in\nthe thinning ejecta (~90 days after explosion). We infer a departure from\nspherical symmetry of at least 30 per cent for the inner ejecta. Combined with\nearlier results, this suggests that a strongly non-spherical explosion may be a\ngeneric feature of core-collapse supernovae of all types, where the asphericity\nin type II-P supernovae is cloaked at early times by the massive, opaque,\nhydrogen envelope.",

In analogy to the usual phase transition\nthat is characterized by a sudden change of the symmetry, the topological phase\ntransitions are governed by a discontinuous change of the topological numbers\nsignaled by the divergence of the zero-temperature topological susceptibility.\nThis defines a quantum criticality ruled by topologically conserved numbers\nrather than the Landau principle of the symmetry breaking.

The fRG provides the universal low-energy asymptotics as well as\nnonuniversal properties, and in particular an answer to the important question\nat what scale the ultimate asymptotics sets in.\n  We investigate the influence of impurities on spectral and transport\nproperties of fermionic lattice models with short-range interactions. The\nresults capture relevant energy scales and crossover phenomena, in addition to\nthe universal low-energy asymptotics. For weak and intermediate impurity\nstrengths the asymptotic behavior is approached only at rather low energy\nscales, accessible only for very large systems. For spin-1/2 systems\ntwo-particle backscattering leads to striking effects, which are not captured\nif the bulk system is approximated by its low-energy fixed point, the Luttinger\nmodel.

We show that the mere change in topology from\nan open chain to a ring induces synchronization for a certain range of\npacemaker frequencies and couplings, while keeping the other parameters fixed.\nMoreover we demonstrate numerically that the critical frequency of the\npacemaker decreases as a power of the linear size of the lattice with an\nexponent equal to the dimension of the system. This leads in particular to the\nconclusion that for infinite-dimensional topologies the critical frequency for\nhaving entrainment decreases exponentially with the size of the system, or,\nmore generally, with the depth of the network, that is the average distance of\nthe oscillators from the pacemaker.",

In the weak field limit\nthis amounts to adding a small logarithmic correction to the newtonian\npotential. A test star moving in such a spacetime acquires a constant\nasymptotic speed at large distances. This speed turns out to be proportional to\nthe fourth root of the mass of the central body in compliance with the\nTully-Fisher relation. A variance of MOND's gravity emerges as an inevitable\nconsequence of the proposed formalism. It has also been shown (Mendoza et al.\n2006) that a) the gravitational waves in this spacetime propagate with the\nspeed of light in vacuum and b) there is a lensing effect additional to what\none finds in the classic GR.",

Following this objective we develop\nthe concepts of homomorphism and $\\epsilon$-homomorphism of probabilistic\nregulatory networks, since these concepts bring the properties from one\nnetworks to another. Projections are special homomorphisms, and they always\ninduce invariant subnetworks that contain all cycles and steady states in the\nnetwork.",

The modes are the result of polarization evolution of the original\nnatural waves in the hot magnetized weakly inhomogeneous plasma of pulsar\nmagnetosphere. In the course of wave mode coupling, the linearly polarized\nnatural waves acquire purely orthogonal elliptical polarizations. Further on,\nas the waves pass through the cyclotron resonance, they become non-orthogonal.\nThe pulse-to-pulse fluctuations of the final polarization characteristics and\nthe intensity ratio of the modes are attributed to the temporal fluctuations in\nthe plasma flow.\n  The model suggested allows to reproduce the basic features of the\none-dimensional distributions of the individual-pulse polarization\ncharacteristics. Besides that, propagation origin of pulsar polarization\nimplies a certain correlation between the mode ellipticity and position angle.\nOn a qualitative level, for different sets of parameters, the expected\ncorrelations appear compatible with the observed ones. Further theoretical\nstudies are necessary to establish the quantitative correspondence of the model\nto the observational results and to develop a technique of diagnostics of\npulsar plasma on this basis.",

We are able to constrain the relation between the characteristic\nfrequencies of the Lorentzian components, and show that it is consistent with a\npower-law relation having the same index (1.2) as previously reported for the\nhard state, but shifted by a factor ~2. Furthermore, it is shown that the\nchange in the frequency relation seen during the transitions can be explained\nby invoking a shift of one Lorentzian component to a higher harmonic, and we\nexplore the possible support for this interpretation in the other component\nparameters. With the improved soft state results we study the evolution of the\nfractional variance for each temporal component. This approach indicates that\nthe two Lorentzian components are connected to each other, and unrelated to the\npower-law component in the power spectrum, pointing to at least two separate\nemission components.",

By a simple dimensional argument, we prove that the tidal\neffect on the light ray propagation mainly occurs in the weak field region far\naway from the black hole and that the external perturbation can be treated as a\nweak field quadrupole term. We provide a description of relativistic critical\ncurves and caustics and discuss the inversion of the lens mapping. Relativistic\ncaustics are shifted and acquire a finite diamond shape. Sources inside the\ncaustics produce four sequences of relativistic images. On the other hand,\nretro-lensing caustics are only shifted while remaining point-like to the\nlowest order.",

The\nconditional probability distribution of response P(y|x) is found to be markedly\nnon-gaussian at small magnitude of pushes and tending to more gauss-like\nbehavior upon growing push magnitude.

These limits are\nbased on calculations that rely on Vector Meson Dominance (VMD). VMD was\ninvented in order to describe the interaction of electrons with hadrons (the\nrho meson and pions). The method has been used also as a tool in the study of\nTechnicolor phenomenology. Nevertheless there are evidences in the sense that,\neven in its original, context VMD is not completely realized. In this work we\ninvestigate the consequences of a deviation from complete VMD for the\nphenomenology of colored technihadrons. We focus specially on the production of\nthe color octet technirho and color triplet technipions. We found that a\nrelative small direct coupling of the proto-technirho to quarks is enough to\nsuppress or even eliminate the interaction among quarks and the physical\ntechnirho. On the other hand, it is possible to suppress the coupling of the\nphysical technirho to technipions but in this case a large interaction among\nthe technipions and the proto-gluon must be introduced. The consequences for\nthe limits on the mass of the color octet technirho are also investigated.",

We propose a simple analytic theory based on scaling arguments which\ndescribes the relaxation of the initial coil into a flat-shaped layer for the\ncases of both Rouse and Zimm dynamics. For Rouse dynamics the characteristic\ntimes for attaining equilibrium values of the gyration radius components\nperpendicular and parallel to the interface are predicted to scale with block\nlength $M$ and chain length $N$ as $\\tau_{\\perp} \\propto M^{1+2\\nu}$ (here\n$\\nu\\approx 0.6$ is the Flory exponent) and as $\\tau_{\\parallel} \\propto N^2$,\nalthough initially the characteristic coil flattening time is predicted to\nscale with block size as $\\propto M$. Since typically $N\\gg M$ for multiblock\ncopolymers, our results suggest that the flattening dynamics proceeds faster\nperpendicular rather than parallel to the interface, in contrast to the case of\nZimm dynamics where the two components relax with comparable rate, and proceed\nconsiderably slower than in the Rouse case.\n  We also demonstrate that, in the case of Rouse dynamics, these scaling\npredictions agree well with the results of Monte Carlo simulations of the\nlocalization dynamics.

In particular allowing\nnon-universal gauginos opens up the bulk region that allows Bino annihilation\nvia t-channel slepton exchange, leading to ``supernatural dark matter''\ncorresponding to no fine-tuning at all with respect to dark matter. By contrast\nwe find that the recently proposed ``well tempered neutralino'' regions involve\nsubstantial fine-tuning of MSSM parameters in order to satisfy the dark matter\nconstraints, although the fine tuning may be ameliorated if several\nannihilation channels act simultaneously.

The majority of\nthese ``optically--dull'' AGN are no more than 6 times fainter than their host\ngalaxies in rest-frame R-band; as such, AGN lines are unlikely to be\noverwhelmed by stellar continuum in at least half the sample. We find that\noptically--dull AGN have the mid--infrared emission and L(x)/L(IR) ratios\ncharacteristic of local Seyferts, suggesting that the cause of optical dullness\nis not missing UV--optical continua. We compare the morphologies of 22\noptically--dull and 9 optically--active AGN at 0.5<z<0.8, and find that\noptically--dull AGN show a wide range of axis ratio, but optically--active AGN\nhave only very round axis ratios. We conclude that hard X-rays select AGN in\nhost galaxies with a wide range of inclination angle, but only those AGN in the\nmost face-on or spheroidal host galaxies show optical emission lines. Thus,\nextranuclear dust in the host galaxy plays an important role in hiding the\nemission lines of optically--dull AGN.",

This brings the total number of confirmed white dwarf members to\neleven making this the second largest collection of these objects in an open\ncluster identified to date. This number is consistent with the high mass end of\nthe initial mass function of Praesepe being Salpeter in form. Furthermore, it\nsuggests that the bulk of Praesepe white dwarfs did not gain a substantial\nrecoil kick velocity from possible asymmetries in their loss of mass during the\nasymptotic giant branch phase of evolution. By comparing our estimates of the\neffective temperatures and the surface gravities of WD0833+194, WD0840+190,\nWD0840+205 and WD0843+184 to modern theoretical evolutionary tracks we have\nderived their masses to be in the range 0.72-0.76Msun and their cooling ages\n\\~300Myrs. For an assumed cluster age of 625+/-50Myrs the infered progenitor\nmasses are between 3.3-3.5Msun. Examining these new data in the context of the\ninitial mass-final mass relation we find that it can be adequately represented\nby a linear function (a0=0.289+/-0.051, a1=0.133+/-0.015) over the initial mass\nrange 2.7Msun to 6Msun. Assuming an extrapolation of this relation to larger\ninitial masses is valid and adopting a maximum white dwarf mass of 1.3Msun, our\nresults support a minimum mass for core-collapse supernovae progenitors in the\nrange ~6.8-8.6Msun.",

We deduce the spinor representation of the restricted\nconformal group in geometric algebra, and use it to show that the position\ndependence is the result of the action of the translation operator in the\nconformal space on the 4-d spinor. We obtain the geometrical description of\ntwistors through the conformal geometric algebra, and derive the Robinson\ncongruence. This verifies our formalism. Furthermore, we show that this novel\napproach brings considerable simplifications to the twistor formalism, and new\nadvantages. We map the twistor to the 6-d conformal space, and derive the\nsimplest geometrical description of the twistor as an observable of a\nrelativistic quantum system. The new 6-d twistor takes the r\\^ole of the state\nfor that system. In our new interpretation of twistors as 4-d spinors, we\ntherefore only need to apply the machinery already known from quantum mechanics\nin the geometric algebra formalism, in order to recover the physical and\ngeometrical properties of 1-valence twistors.",

We demonstrate that classical\nindirect methods (isochrone fitting and integrated spectra) of metallicity\ndetermination lead to values of [Fe/H] which are 0.3 to 0.5 dex too high, and\nthat this is primarily due to the underlying reference calibration typically\nused by these studies. We show that Cluster 1, with [Fe /H] = -2.5, now holds\nthe record for the lowest metallicity globular cluster. We also measure an\nover-abundance of Eu in Cluster 3 stars that has only been previously detected\nin a subgroup of stars in M15. We find that the Fornax globular cluster\nproperties are a global match to what is found in their Galactic counterparts;\nincluding deep mixing abundance patterns in two stars.

We suggest these capabilities are best\nrealised by spectroscopic calibration of BD properties (Teff, g and [M/H])\nwhich, when combined with a measured luminosity and an evolutionary model can\ngive BD mass and age relatively independent of BD atmosphere models. Such\ncalibration requires an empirical understanding of how BD spectra are affected\nby variations in these properties, and thus the identification and study of\n\"benchmark BDs\" whose age and composition can be established independently. We\nidentify the best sources of benchmark BDs as young open cluster members,\nmoving group members, and wide (>1000AU) BD companions to both subgiant stars\nand high mass white dwarfs (WDs). We have used 2MASS to measure a wide L dwarf\ncompanion fraction of 2.7(+0.7/-0.5)%, which equates to a BD companion fraction\nof 34(+9/-6)% for an alpha~1 companion mass function. Using this value we\nsimulate populations of wide BD binaries, and estimate that 80(+21/-14)\nsubgiant--BD binaries, and 50(+13/-10) benchmark WD--BD binaries could be\nidentified using current and new facilities. The WD--BD binaries should all be\nidentifiable using the Large Area Survey component of UKIDSS combined with\nSloan. Discovery of the subgiant--BD binaries will require a NIR imaging\ncampaign around a large (~900) sample of Hipparcos subgiants.

Rather than relying on prior knowledge about the\nforeground components, we first extract the necessary information about them\ndirectly from the microwave sky maps by taking differences of temperature maps\nat different frequencies. These difference maps, which we refer to as internal\ntemplates, consist only of linear combinations of galactic foregrounds and\nnoise, with no CMB component. We obtain the foreground cleaned maps by fitting\nthese internal templates to, and subsequently subtracting the appropriately\nscaled contributions of them from, the CMB dominated channels. The fitting\noperation is performed in wavelet space, making the analysis feasible at high\nresolution with only a minor loss of precision. Applying this procedure to the\nWMAP data, we obtain a power spectrum that matches the spectrum obtained by the\nWMAP team at the signal dominated scales. Finally, we have revisited previous\nclaims about a north-south power asymmetry on large angular scales, and confirm\nthat these remain unchanged with this completely different approach to\nforeground separation. This also holds when fitting the foreground contribution\nindependently to the northern and southern hemisphere indicating that the\nasymmetry is unlikely to have its origin in different foreground properties of\nthe hemispheres. This conclusion is further strengthened by the lack of any\nobserved frequency dependence.",

    "summary": "Gravitational waves (GWs) from the inspiral of compact remnants (CRs) into\nmassive black holes (MBHs) will be observable to cosmological distances. While\na CR spirals in, 2-body scattering by field stars may cause it to fall into the\nMBH before reaching a short period orbit that would give an observable signal.\nAs a result, only CRs very near (~0.01 pc) the MBH can spiral in successfully.\nIn a multi-mass stellar population, the heaviest objects sink to the center,\nwhere they are more likely to slowly spiral into the MBH without being\nswallowed prematurely. We study how mass-segregation modifies the stellar\ndistribution and the rate of GW events. We find that the inspiral rate per\ngalaxy for white dwarfs is 30 per Gyr, for neutron stars 6 per Gyr, and for\nstellar black holes (SBHs) 250 per Gyr. The high rate for SBHs is due to their\nextremely steep density profile, n_{BH}(r)\\propto r^{-2}. The GW detection rate\nwill be dominated by SBHs.",

The formation of a\npopulation of young stars in close proximity to a massive black hole presents a\ndifficult challenge to star formation theory. We point out that in a high\nstellar density environment, the course of stellar evolution is modified by\nfrequent collisions and mergers. METHODS: Blue stragglers, which are the\nresults of mergers in globular clusters, occupy the same position in the\ncolor-magnitude diagram as the observed hot stars in M31. For confirmation, the\nintegrated spectrum of P3 is shown to be compatible with the spectral energy\ndistribution of a blue horizontal branch field star. RESULTS: We suggest an old\nstellar population of evolved blue horizontal-branch stars and of merger\nproducts cannot be ruled out on the basis of the available data. Observations\nare suggested that would help distinguish between a ``young'' and ``old''\nstellar population interpretation of the observations.",

The measured visibility amplitudes beyond the first lobe\nare significantly weaker than expected for a slowly rotating star characterized\nby a single effective temperature and surface gravity. Our measurements, when\ncompared to synthetic visibilities and synthetic spectrophotometry from a\nRoche-von Zeipel gravity-darkened model atmosphere, provide strong evidence for\nthe model of Vega as a rapidly rotating star viewed very nearly pole-on. Our\nbest fitting model indicates that Vega is rotating at ~91% of its angular\nbreak-up rate with an equatorial velocity of 275 km/s. Together with the\nmeasured vsin(i), this velocity yields an inclination for the rotation axis of\n5 degrees. For this model the pole-to-equator effective temperature difference\nis 2250 K, a value much larger than previously derived from spectral line\nanalyses. The derived equatorial T_eff of 7900 K indicates Vega's equatorial\natmosphere may be convective and provides a possible explanation for the\ndiscrepancy. The model has a luminosity of ~37 Lsun, a value 35% lower than\nVega's apparent luminosity based on its bolometric flux and parallax, assuming\na slowly rotating star. The model luminosity is consistent with the mean\nabsolute magnitude of A0V stars. Our model predicts the spectral energy\ndistribution of Vega as viewed from its equatorial plane; a model which may be\nemployed in radiative models for the surrounding debris disk.",

The maps reveal more than 100 dusty clumps with\ndeconvolved linear sizes of 0.05--0.2 pc and masses of 0.8--120 solar masses,\nmost of which are not associated with known mid-infrared point sources. Fitting\nthe clump mass function with a double power law gives a mean power law exponent\nof alpha_high = -2.4 +/- 0.3 for the high-mass power law, consistent with the\nexponent of the Salpeter stellar mass function. We show that a lognormal clump\nmass distribution with a peak at about 4 solar masses produces as good a fit to\nthe clump mass function as does a double power law. This 4 solar mass peak mass\nis well above the peak masses of both the stellar initial mass function and the\nmass function of clumps in low-mass star-forming regions. Despite the\ndifference in intrinsic mass scale, the shape of the M17 clump mass function\nappears to be consistent with the shape of the core mass function in low-mass\nstar-forming regions. Thus, we suggest that the clump mass function in\nhigh-mass star-forming regions may be a scaled-up version of that in low-mass\nregions, instead of its extension to higher masses.",

Irrespective of the origin of the core, reasonable\ndynamical limits on the mass of the Fornax halo constrain its core radius to be\nno larger than 700 pc.

Similar features have been discovered in the AGB populations\nof other clusters. Unfortunately all of these studies suffer from low AGB star\ncounts so the conclusions are not necessarily robust -- larger, statistically\nsignifcant, sample sizes are needed.\n  We outline the results of a literature search for relevant CN observations\nand describe our observing proposal to test the suggestion that there are\nsubstantial abundance differences between the AGB and RGB in galactic globular\nclusters. The literature search revealed that the AGB star counts for all\nstudies (which are not, in general, studies about AGB stars in particular) are\nlow, usually being < or = 10. The search also revealed that the picture may not\nbe consistent between clusters. Although most clusters appear to have CN-weak\nAGBs, at least two seem to have CN-strong AGBs (M5 & 47 Tuc). To further\ncomplicate the picture, clusters often appear to have a combination of both\nCN-strong and CN-weak stars on their AGBs -- although one population tends to\ndominate. Again, all these assertions are however based on small sample\nsizes.We aim to increase the sample sizes by an order of magnitude using\nexisting high quality photometry in which the AGB and RGB can be reliably\nseparated. For the observations we will use a wide-field, low- to\nmid-resolution multi-object spectroscope.

Of these, three were\nfound to be exclusively `B' mode, and three were discovered to exhibit\ntransitions from the `Q' to the `B' mode. One of these observations has\npermitted us to determine the circulation time of the subbeam carousel in the\n`Q' mode for the first time, at some 36.4$\\pm$0.9 stellar rotation periods. The\nonset of the `B' mode is then observed to commence similarly in all three\nobservations. The initial circulation time is about 36 periods and relaxes to\nnearly 38 periods in a roughly exponential fashion with a characteristic time\nof some 1.2 hours. This is the longest characteristic time ever found in a\nmode-switching pulsar. Moreover, just after the `B'-mode onset the pulsar\nexhibits a symmetrical resolved-double profile form with a somewhat stronger\ntrailing component, but this second component slowly dies away leaving the\nusual single `B'-mode profile with the longitude of the magnetic axis falling\nat about its trailing half power point. Thus it would appear that Q-to-B- and\nB-to-Q-transitions have different characteristic times. Some speculations are\ngiven on the nature of this slow modal alternation.",

    "summary": "The free energy of a crystalline domain coexisting with a liquid phase on a\nspherical vesicle may be approximated by an elastic or stretching energy and a\nline tension term. The stretching energy generally grows as the area of the\ndomain, while the line tension term grows with its perimeter. We show that if\nthe crystalline domain contains defect arrays consisting of finite length grain\nboundaries of dislocations (scars) the stretching energy grows linearly with a\ncharacteristic length of the crystalline domain. We show that this result is\ncritical to understand the existence of solid domains in lipid-bilayers in the\nstrongly segregated two phase region even for small relative area coverages.\nThe domains evolve from caps to stripes that become thinner as the line tension\nis decreased. We also discuss the implications of the results for other\nexperimental systems and for the general problem that consists in finding the\nground state of a very large number of particles constrained to move on a fixed\ngeometry and interacting with an isotropic potential.",

This\ninformation can then be used to improve the overall integrity of both the\nindividual computer where a questionable service is running and in aggregate an\nentire network of computers.\n  NCSA has developed an application called SMART (Services Monitoring And\nReporting Tool) that can be used to identify and display all services currently\nrunning in the network. A commercial program called Hyena remotely monitors the\nservices on all computers attached to the network and exports this information\nto SMART. SMART produces various outputs that the system administrator can\nanalyze and then determine appropriate actions to take. In particular, SMART\nprovides a color coordinated user interface to quickly identify and classify\nboth potentially hazardous services and also unknown services.",

The\neffect of viscosity stratification, heat diffusivity and of buoyancy are\nestimated separately, with some unexpected results. From linear stability\nresults, it has been accepted that heat diffusivity does not affect stability.\nHowever, we show that realistic Prandtl numbers cause a transient growth of\ndisturbances that is an order of magnitude higher than at zero Prandtl number.\nBuoyancy, even at fairly low levels, gives rise to high levels of subcritical\nenergy growth. Unusually for transient growth, both of these are\nspanwise-independent and not in the form of streamwise vortices. At moderate\nGrashof numbers, exponential growth dominates, with distinct Rayleigh-Benard\nand Poiseuille modes for Grashof numbers upto $\\sim 25000$, which merge\nthereafter. Wall heating has a converse effect on the secondary instability\ncompared to the primary, destabilising significantly when viscosity decreases\ntowards the wall.

Our data set relies on an XMM-Newton campaign of a\nnominal duration of 180 ks and reveals that NGC 6231 is very rich in the X-ray\ndomain too. Indeed, 610 X-ray sources are detected in the present field of\nview, centered on the cluster core. The limiting sensitivity of our survey is\napproximately 6E-15 erg/s/cm^2 but clearly depends on the location in the field\nof view and on the source spectrum. Using different existing catalogues, over\n85% of the X-ray sources could be associated with at least one optical and/or\ninfrared counterpart within a limited cross-correlation radius of 3 arcsec at\nmaximum. The surface density distribution of the X-ray sources presents a\nslight N-S elongation. Once corrected for the spatial sensitivity variation of\nthe EPIC instruments, the radial profile of the source surface density is well\ndescribed by a King profile with a central density of about 8 sources per\narcmin^2 and a core radius close to 3.1arcmin. The distribution of the X-ray\nsources seems closely related to the optical source distribution. The expected\nnumber of foreground and background sources should represent about 9% of the\ndetected sources, thus strongly suggesting that most of the observed X-ray\nemitters are physically belonging to NGC 6231. Finally, beside a few bright but\nsoft objects -- corresponding to the early-type stars of the cluster -- most of\nthe sources are relatively faint (~5E-15 erg/s/cm^2) with an energy\ndistribution peaked around 1.0-2.0 keV.",

We use these measurements to determine the\nplane-of-sky magnetic field orientation in the cores. In L1498 we see a\nmagnetic field across the peak of the core that lies at an offset of 19 degrees\nto the short axis of the core. This is similar to the offsets seen in previous\nobservations of prestellar cores. To the southeast of the peak, in the\nfilamentary tail of the core, we see that the magnetic field has rotated to lie\nalmost parallel to the long axis of the filament. We hypothesise that the field\nin the core may have decoupled from the field in the filament that connects the\ncore to the rest of the cloud. We use the Chandrasekhar-Fermi (CF) method to\nmeasure the plane-of-sky field strength in the core of L1498 to be 10 +/- 7 uG.\n  In L1517B we see a more gradual turn in the field direction from the northern\npart of the core to the south. This appears to follow a twist in the filament\nin which the core is buried, with the field staying at a roughly constant 25\ndegree offset to the short axis of the filament, also consistent with previous\nobservations of prestellar cores. We again use the CF method and calculate the\nmagnetic field strength in L1517B also to be 30 +/- 10 uG. Both cores appear to\nbe roughly virialised. Comparison with our previous work on somewhat denser\ncores shows that, for the denser cores, thermal and non-thermal (including\nmagnetic) support are approximately equal, while for the lower density cores\nstudied here, thermal support dominates.",

Our calculations are for orbital phase 0.837 when the observed radio\nemission is close to maximum. Using the observed thermal X-ray emission\ntogether with the radio emission to constrain the mass-loss rates, we find that\nthe O-star mass-loss rate is consistent with recent reductions for O4-5\nsupergiants. We demonstrate that radio VLBI observations of the WCR fail to\nconstrain the opening angle. The observed low frequency turnover at ~3 GHz in\nthe radio emission is due to free-free absorption, since models based on the\nRazin effect have an unacceptably large fraction of energy in non-thermal\nparticles. The index of the non-thermal electron energy distribution is flatter\nthan the canonical value for diffusive shock acceleration, namely p<2. Several\nmechanisms are discussed that could lead to such an index. Tighter constraints\non p and the nature of the shocks in WR140 will be obtained from future\nobservations at MeV and GeV energies, for which we generally predict lower\nfluxes than previous work. Since the high stellar photon fluxes prevent the\nacceleration of electrons beyond gamma > 1e5-1e6, TeV emission from CWB systems\nwill provide unambiguous evidence of pion-decay emission from accelerated ions.\nWe finish by commenting on the emission and physics of the multiple wind\ncollisions in dense stellar clusters, paying particular attention to the\nGalactic Centre (abridged).",

    "summary": "A new approach based on macro-orbital representation of a conduction electron\nin a solid has been used to discover some untouched aspects of the phonon\ninduced attraction between two electrons and to lay the basic foundations of a\ngeneral theory of superconductivity applicable to widely different solids. To\nthis effect we first analyze the net hamiltonian, H(N), of N conduction\nelectrons to identify its universal part, H_o(N) (independent of the nature of\na specific solid or a specific class of solids), and then study the states of\nH_o(N) to conclude that superconductivity originates, basically, from an\ninter-play between the zero- point force (f_o) of conduction electrons in their\nground state and the inter-atomic forces (f_a) which decide the lattice\nstructure. This renders a kind of mechanical strain in the lattice which serves\nas the main source of phonon induced inter-electron attraction responsible for\nthe formation of Cooper type pairs and the onset of superconductivity below\ncertain temperature T_c. We determine the binding energy of such pairs and find\na relation for T_c which not only accounts for the highest experimental T_c =\n135 K that we know to-day but also indicates that superconductivity may, in\nprinciple, occur at room temperature. It is evident that electrical strain in\nthe lattice (i.e., electrical polarization of the lattice constituents produced\nby the charge of conducting electrons) can have an added contribution to the\nphonon induced attraction of two electrons. Our theoretical framework not only\nincorporates BCS model but also provides microscopic basis for the two well\nknown phenomenologies of superconductivity, viz., the two fluid theory and\nPsi-theory. In addition, it also corroborates a recent idea that\nsuperconducting transition is basically a quantum phase transition.",

Second, using\nthese moments as an input to the proposed modification of the Jacobi polynomial\nexpansion method (MJEM), one eventually reconstructs the local quark helicity\ndistributions themselves. All numerical tests demonstrate that MJEM allows us\nto reproduce with the high precision the input local distributions even inside\nthe narrow Bjorken $x$ region accessible for experiment. It is of importance\nthat only four first input moments are sufficient to achieve a good quality of\nreconstruction. The application of the method to the simulated SIDIS data on\nthe pion production is considered. The obtained results encourage one that the\nproposed NLO method can be successfully applied to the SIDIS data analysis. The\nanalysis of HERMES data on pion production is performed. To this end the pion\ndifference asymmetries are constructed from the measured by HERMES standard\nsemi-inclusive spin asymmetries.

This is a novel approach, that\ncan be of general utility in all high precision radial velocity surveys based\non iodine cell data. This software has then been extensively used on data\nacquired within our survey, allowing a proper insight into a number of\ninteresting cases, where spurious estimates of the radial velocities due to\nactivity or contamination by light from the companions were revealed. The same\ntechnique can also be considered to correct the measured radial velocities, in\norder to search for planets around active stars.",

Initial\nmagnetic field used in the simulations has dipole-like symmetry. Contrary to\nthe simulations of MR supernova with initial quadrupole-like magnetic field,\nwhere the matter was ejected mainly near the equatorial plane, in presence of\nthe dipole-like initial magnetic field the supernova explosion is developing\npreferably along a rotational axis, and leads to formation of a protojet. We\nexpect that protojet propagation through the envelope of the star will be\naccompanied by its collimation. The magnetorotational instability (MRI) was\nfound in simulations, similar to the earlier considered case of the\nquadrupole-like initial magnetic field. Our estimations show that the\ncharacteristic time for the reconnection of the magnetic field is much larger\nthan the MRI development time. The supernova explosion energy for the\ndipole-like field is about $0.61\\cdot 10^{51}$erg, and about $0.13M_\\odot$ of\nmass was ejected during the explosion.",

For the linear molecule, well defined molecular layers\ndevelop in the lubricant film when the width is of the order of a few atomic\ndiameters. The branched iso-butane forms more disordered structures which\npermit it to stay liquid-like at smaller surface separations. During squeezing\nthe solvation forces show oscillations corresponding to the width of a\nmolecule. At low speeds (< 0.1 m/s) the last layers of iso-butane are squeezed\nout before those of n-butane. Since the (interfacial) squeezing velocity in\nmost practical applications is very low when the lubricant layer has molecular\nthickness, one expects n-butane to be a better boundary lubricant than\niso-butane. N-butane possessing a slightly lower viscosity at high pressures,\nour result refutes the view that squeeze out should be harder for higher\nviscosities, on the other hand our results are consistent with wear experiments\nin which n-butane were shown to protect steel surfaces better than iso-butane.",

Triangulations of the genotope\ncorrespond to different shapes of fitness landscapes and reveal all the gene\ninteractions. The theory is applied to fitness data from HIV and Drosophila\nmelanogaster. In both cases, our findings refine earlier analyses and reveal\npreviously undetected gene interactions.",

We consider\nthe measured orbital periods, period derivatives and inferred X-ray\nluminosities of these two sources and find constraints on system parameters in\norder for the model to account for them. We find that these properties point to\nthe two sources being in different regimes of the UIM, with the requirement of\nlow magnetic moment primaries ($\\sim 10^{30} G cm^3$) for both. Given this weak\nmagnetization, RX J0806+15 has a sufficiently low luminosity that it can be\ninterpreted as having a primary spin almost synchronous to and just slightly\nslower than the orbital motion. Its measured orbital spin-up is only slightly\naffected by spin-orbit coupling and is mostly due to GW emission. RX J1914+24,\non the other hand, is too bright in X-rays and has too slow an orbital spin-up\nfor the same regime to apply. We suggest that this binary system may be\nemitting GWs at a significantly higher rate than implied by its measured\n$\\dot{\\omega}_o = 6 \\times 10^{-17} rad s^{-2}$. The latter is explained, in\nthis framework, by the primary spin being slightly faster than the orbital\nmotion ($\\alpha <or= 1.1$). In this case, the associated spin-orbit coupling\ntransfers to the orbit a significant amount of angular momentum, thus partially\nbalancing that lost to GW emission. All expectations can be tested in the near\nfuture to confirm the viability of the model.",

The\ncharged leptons and the light neutrinos receive mass from the five dimensional\nYukawa couplings with the SM singlet neutrino via electroweak Higgs, while the\nKK excitations of the SM singlet neutrino gets large TeV scale masses from the\nfive dimensional Yukawa coupling with an electroweak singlet Higgs. The model\ngives non-hierarchical light neutrino masses, accommodate hierarchical charged\nlepton masses, and naturally explain why the light neutrino masses are so much\nsmaller compared to the charged lepton masses. Large neutrino mixing is\nnaturally expected in this scenario. The light neutrinos are Dirac particles in\nthis model, hence neutrinoless double beta decay is not allowed. The model has\nalso several interesting collider implications and can be tested at the LHC.",

    "summary": "A previously considered model interpreted a superconductor as an electron gas\nimmersed in a medium with the dielectric constant $\\epsilon$ and a certain\nelasticity, which could be determined by measured sonic speed in the metal. The\nobtained expression of effective electron-electron interaction (EEI) potential\nunambiguously implied that, contrary to the suggestions of BCS theory, it is\nits long-wave limit which is responsible for the emergence of bound\ntwo-electron states and, consequently, for gap formation in one-electron\nspectrum of the metal. However, the existence of singularities in the EEI\npotential expression continued to pose a problem, which did not allow a\ncalculation of the gap value for specific superconducting materials, first of\nall, for metals belonging to periodic table (PT). In the present work, I\nsuggest taking into account matrix elements traditionally attributed to\nelectron scattering in EEI effective potential calculations. For\nsuperconductors that has been made on the basis of a semiconductor material by\nimplanting electro-active defects into it, this inclusion results in the\nappearance of an uncertainty of electron momentum $\\delta p \\sim l^{- 1}$,\nwhere $l$ is the electron free path. When considering pure PT metals,\nHamiltonian terms relating to creation and annihilaton of phonons should be\ntaken into account, which also produces an uncertainty of electron momentum.\nThis uncertainty results in a regularization of EEI potential expression and,\ntherefore, in a possibility of examination of physical properties of specific\nsuperconductors. Results of calculation of superconductivity gap value for a\nrange of simple metals (Al, Zn, Pb, Sn) confirm the consistency of the\ndeveloped approach.",

    "summary": "Motivated by Refs \\cite{am1,am2}, we analyze how the inflaton decay reheats\nthe Universe within supersymmetry. In a non-supersymmetric case the inflaton\nusually decays via preheating unless its couplings to other fields are very\nsmall. Naively one would expect that supersymmetry enhances bosonic preheating\nas it introduces new scalars such as squarks and sleptons. On the contrary, we\npoint out that preheating is unlikely within supersymmetry. The reason is that\nflat directions in the scalar potential, classified by gauge invariant\ncombinations of slepton and squark fields, are generically displaced towards a\nlarge vacuum expectation value (VEV) in the early Universe. They induce\nsupersymmetry preserving masses to the inflaton decay products through the\nStandard Model Yukawa couplings, which kinematically blocks preheating for VEVs\n$> 10^{13}$ GeV. The decay will become allowed only after the flat directions\nstart oscillating, and once the flat direction VEV is sufficiently redshifted.\nFor models with weak scale supersymmetry, this generically happens at a Hubble\nexpansion rate: $H \\simeq (10^{-3}-10^{-1}) {\\rm TeV}$, at which time the\ninflaton decays in the perturbative regime. This is to our knowledge first\nanalysis where the inflaton decay to the Standard Model particles is treated\nproperly within supersymmetry. There are number of important consequences: no\noverproduction of dangerous supersymmetric relics (particularly gravitinos), no\nresonant excitation of superheavy dark matter, and no non-thermal leptogenesis\nthrough non-perturbative creation of the right-handed (s)neutrinos. Finally\nsupersymmetric flat directions can even spoil hybrid inflation all together by\nnot allowing the auxiliary field become tachyonic.",

An S-wave is executed by\nthe emission cores of the Hydrogen Balmer lines and by the emission lines of He\nI, Ca II, Fe II and He II. Using Doppler tomography we show it originates in\nthe accretion stream-disc impact region. The He II emission is strongly\nphase-dependent, suggesting it originates exclusively within a hot cavity at\nthe initial impact. We map the ionization structure of the stream-disc\ninteraction region. One possible interpretation of this is that the Balmer\nhotspot lies downstream of the He II hotspot in the outer accretion disc, with\nthe He I and Ca II hotspots at intermediate locations between the two. This\nsuggests that Balmer emission is suppressed until material has cooled somewhat\ndownstream of the impact site and is able to recombine. We favour a phase\noffset of 0.15+/-0.04 between the photometric ephemeris and inferior\nconjunction of the mass donor. The white dwarf contributes significantly to the\noptical continuum, with broad Balmer absorption and narrow Mg II 4481\nabsorption clearly apparent. This latter feature yields the gravitational\nredshift: v_grav=38+/-21 km s^-1, so M_1=0.71+0.18-0.26 M_sun. This implies\nM_2=0.11 +/- 0.03 M_sun and hence the donor is not a brown dwarf. A prominent\nBalmer jump is also observed. We note that the previously accepted system\nparameters for both VW Hyi and WX Hyi incoporate an algebraic error, and we\nprovide a recalculated M_1(q) plane for WX Hyi.",

In the case of a separable potential, it is possible to compute\nthe curvature perturbation up to second order in the perturbations, generated\non large scales due to the presence of non-adiabatic perturbations, by\nemploying the $\\delta N$-formalism, in the slow-roll approximation. In this\ncase, we provide an analytic formula for the nonlinear parameter $f_{NL}$. We\napply this formula to double inflation with two massive fields, showing that it\ndoes not generate significant non-Gaussianity; the nonlinear parameter at the\nend of inflation is slow-roll suppressed. Finally, we develop a numerical\nmethod for generic two-field models of inflation, which allows us to go beyond\nthe slow-roll approximation and confirms our analytic results for double\ninflation.",

The lack of experimental guidance has made\nthe issue extremely evasive, though various attempts have been made to relate\nthe loss of matter wave coherence to quantum spacetime fluctuations. We present\na new approach to the gravitational decoherence near the Planck scale, made\npossible by recently discovered conformal structure of canonical gravity. This\nleads to a gravitational analogue of the Brownian motion whose correlation\nlength is given by the Planck length up to a scaling factor. With input from\nrecent matter wave experiments, we show that the minimum value of this factor\nto be well within the expected range for quantum gravity theories. This\nsuggests that the sensitivities of advanced matter wave interferometers may be\napproaching the fundamental level due to quantum spacetime fluctuations and\nthat investigating Planck scale physics using matter wave interferometry may\nbecome a reality in the near future.",

The third aspect concerns the definition of a\nfunction to compute affine formulas with positive rational coefficients.

Equivalently, M_CMO is directly proportional to\nthe host spheroid mass over 4 orders of magnitude. We note that this result has\nbeen simultaneously and independently identified by Cote et al.

We therefore suggest that the dE,N nuclei may be\nthe low-mass analogs of supermassive black holes, and that these two types of\nCMO's may have both developed starting from similar initial formation\nprocesses. The overlap mass interval between the two types of CMO's is small,\nand suggests that for M_CMO > 10^7 M_sun, the formation of a black hole was\nstrongly favored, perhaps because the initial gas infall to the center was too\nrapid and violent for star formation to occur efficiently.",

The main advantage of the obtained upper bound is that it\ncan be formulated as a semidefinite program, which can be efficiently solved.\nWe illustrate our results by analysing two well-known qubit-based QKD\nprotocols: the four-state protocol and the six-state protocol. Recent results\nby Renner et al., Phys. Rev. A 72, 012332 (2005), also show that the given\nprecondition is only necessary but not sufficient for unidirectional secret key\ndistillation.",

We develop\nand assess two different models. In the first approach, the simulated volume is\nrandomly populated with non-overlapping voids of a range of sizes. This may\nrelate to a snapshot distribution of supernova-remnant voids, although somewhat\nartificially constrained by the non-overlap criterion. In the second approach,\na simplified time evolution (considering momentum conservation as the only\ngoverning constraint during interactions) is followed as SN populate the space\nwith the associated input mass and energy.\n  We describe these simulations and present our results in the form of images\nof the mass and velocity distributions and the associated power spectra. The\nlatter are compared with trends indicated by available observations. In both\napproaches, we find remarkable correspondence with the observed statistical\ndescription of well-studied components of the ISM, wherein the spatial spectra\nhave been found to show significant deviations from the Kolmogorov spectrum.\nOne of the key indications from this study, regardless of whether or not the\nSN-induced turbulence is the dominant process in the ISM, is that the apparent\nnon-Kolmogorov spectral characteristics (of HI and/or electron column density\nacross thick or thin screens) needed to explain related observations may not at\nall be in conflict with the underlying turbulence (i.e. the velocity structure)\nbeing of Kolmogorov nature.

One route by which\nnonlinear flows arise is the onset and evolution of interfacial instabilities.\nInterfacial instabilities act to modify the interface between gas components at\ndifferent densities and temperatures. Such an interface may be subject to a\nhost of instabilities, including the Rayleigh-Taylor, Kelvin-Helmholtz, and\nRichtmyer-Meshkov instabilities. Recently, a new density interface instability\nwas identified. This self-gravity interfacial instability (SGI) causes any\ndisplacement of the interface to gr ow on roughly a free-fall time scale, even\nwhen the perturbation wavelength is much less than the Jeans length. In\nprevious work, we used numerical simulations to confirm the expectations of\nlinear theory and examine the nonlinear evolution of the SGI. We now continue\nour study by generalizing our initial conditions to allow the acceleration due\nto self-gravity to be non-zero across the interface. We also consider the\nbehaviour of the SGI for perturbation wavelengths near the Jeans wavelength. We\nconclude that the action of self-gravity across a density interface may play a\nsignificant role in the ISM either by fueling the growth of new instabilities\nor modifying the evolution of existing instabilities.",

We attribute the\nexcess column density (logN_OVI=14.03 cm^-2) to hot gas within N70, potentially\nthe first detection of OVI associated with a superbubble. In a survey of 12 LMC\nsight lines, Howk et al. (2002a) concluded that there was no correlation\nbetween ISM morphology and N_OVI. We present a reanalysis of their measurements\ncombined with our own and find a clear difference between the superbubble and\nfield samples. The five superbubbles probed to date with FUSE show a\nconsistently higher mean N_OVI than the 12 non-superbubble sight lines, though\nboth samples show equivalent scatter from halo variability. Possible ionization\nmechanisms for N70 are discussed, and we conclude that the observed OVI could\nbe the product of thermal conduction at the interface between the hot, X-ray\nemitting gas inside the superbubble and the cooler, photoionized material\nmaking up the shell seen prominently in Halpha.

Blackbody components with\ntemperature lower limits of >9400 K for IGR J16195-4945 and >18,000 K for IGR\nJ16207-5129 indicate that these are very likely High-Mass X-ray Binaries\n(HMXBs). However, for IGR J16167-4957 and IGR J17195-4100, low extinction and\nthe SEDs indicate later spectral types for the putative companions, indicating\nthat these are not HMXBs.",

    "summary": "The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is commonly used in introductory Computer\nScience to teach basic object-oriented design. However, there appears to be a\nlack of suitable software to support this task. Many of the available programs\nthat support UML focus on developing code and not on enhancing learning. Those\nthat were designed for educational use sometimes have poor interfaces or are\nmissing common and important features, such as multiple selection and\nundo/redo. There is a need for software that is tailored to an instructional\nenvironment and has all the useful and needed functionality for that specific\ntask. This is the purpose of minimUML. minimUML provides a minimum amount of\nUML, just what is commonly used in beginning programming classes, while\nproviding a simple, usable interface. In particular, minimUML was designed to\nsupport abstract design while supplying features for exploratory learning and\nerror avoidance. In addition, it allows for the annotation of diagrams, through\ntext or freeform drawings, so students can receive feedback on their work.\nminimUML was developed with the goal of supporting ease of use, supporting\nnovice students, and a requirement of no prior-training for its use.",

In this paper we shed light on these questions by developing\nan analogy between the cosmological constant and the surface tension of\nmembranes. The ``cosmological constant problem'' has a natural analogue in the\nmembrane context: the vanishingly small surface tension of fluid membranes\nprovides an example where question a) above arises and is answered. We go on to\nfind a direct analogue of Sorkin's proposal for answering question b) in the\nmembrane context, where the discreteness of spacetime translates into the\nmolecular structure of matter. We propose analogue experiments to probe a small\nand fluctuating surface tension in fluid membranes.

Our principal\nresults, which can be tested against observations, are as follows. The last\ndynamical and hydrodynamical interaction between the Clouds about ~ 0.2 Gyr ago\ncan form the apparently off-center bar and peculiar HI spirals of the LMC. The\npresent spatial distributions of young stars with ages less than 20 Myr in the\nLMC can be significantly asymmetric and clumpy owing to the interaction. A\nsmall but non-negligible fraction of stellar and gaseous components can be\ntransferred from the SMC into the LMC during the interaction to form diffuse\nhalo components around the LMC. The burst of star formation in the SMC can be\nsynchronized with that of the LMC about 0.2 Gyr ago in some models. New stars\ncan form from gas in the SMC's tidal tails, one of which can be observed as the\nMagellanic Bridge (MB). The metallicity distribution function of new stars in\nthe MB has a peak of [Fe/H] ~ -0.8, which is significantly smaller than the\nstellar metallicity of the SMC. Based on these results, we discuss the origin\nof 30 Doradus, the southern molecular ridge of the LMC, the globular cluster\nESO 121-SC03, metal-poor inter-Cloud stars within the MB, and giant HI holes of\nthe LMC.",

A high efficiency can be reached by filling the\nmagneto-optical trap with a large number of atoms and subsequently transferring\nthese atoms to the magnetic trap as efficiently as possible. In our case (for\nsodium) this efficiency is limited to 1/3, because the magnetic substates of\nthe F = 1 state, which is used in the trapping process, are equally populated.\nThis limit can be overcome by spin-polarizing the sample before the transfer.\nFor sodium atoms, however, the improvement is very small when it is done in a\nsmall magnetic field due to the large number of optical transitions in\ncombination with the high optical density. In this article we describe\nspin-polarizing sodium atoms in a high magnetic field. The transfer efficiency\nis increased by a factor of 2. The high magnetic field makes the process also\nmore robust against variations in the magnetic field, the laser frequency and\nthe polarization of the laser beam.",

That is, for any $i$, the terminal\nlocation of the $i$-th motion is affixed to the initial point of the\n$\\sigma(i)$-th motion, where $\\sigma$ is a uniformly distributed random\npermutation of $1,...,N$. Such systems play an important role in quantum\nphysics in the description of Boson systems at positive temperature $1/\\beta$.\n  In this paper, we describe the large-N behaviour of the empirical path\nmeasure (the mean of the Dirac measures in the $N$ paths) and of the mean of\nthe normalised occupation measures of the $N$ motions in terms of large\ndeviations principles. The rate functions are given as variational formulas\ninvolving certain entropies and Fenchel-Legendre transforms. Consequences are\ndrawn for asymptotic independence statements and laws of large numbers.\n  In the special case related to quantum physics, our rate function for the\noccupation measures turns out to be equal to the well-known Donsker-Varadhan\nrate function for the occupation measures of one motion in the limit of\ndiverging time. This enables us to prove a simple formula for the large-N\nasymptotic of the symmetrised trace of ${\\rm e}^{-\\beta \\mathcal{H}_N}$, where\n$\\mathcal{H}_N$ is an $N$-particle Hamilton operator in a trap.",

We address this problem by estimating the average\nradiative efficiencies of a large sample of quasars selected from the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey, by combining their luminosity function and their black hole\nmass function. Over the redshift interval $0.4<z<2.1$, we find that quasars\nhave average radiative efficiencies of $\\sim 30% - 35%$, strongly suggesting\nthat their black holes are rotating very fast, with specific angular momentum\n$a \\approx 1$, which stays roughly constant with redshift. The average\nradiative efficiency could be reduced by a factor of $\\sim$2, depending on the\nadopted zeropoint for the black hole mass scale. The inferred large spins and\ntheir lack of significant evolution are in agreement with the predictions of\nrecent semi-analytical models of hierarchical galaxy formation if black holes\ngain most of their mass through accretion.",

The data are\ncomplemented with short-spacing CO(2-1) observations and SiO(1-0) data from the\nVLA. Multiple massive outflows emanate from the mm continuum peak. The CO(2-1)\ndata reveal a quadrupolar outflow system consisting of two outflows inclined by\n\\~90 degrees. One outflow exhibits a cone-like red-shifted morphology with a\njet-like blue-shifted counterpart where a blue counter-cone can only be\ntentatively identified. The SiO(1-0) data suggest the presence of a third\noutflow. Analyzing the 12CO/13CO line ratios indicates decreasing CO line\nopacities with increasing velocities. The other seven detected molecular\nspecies - also high-density tracers like CH3CN, CH3OH, HCOOCH3 - are all ~1-2''\noffset from the mm continuum peak, but spatially associated with a strong\nmolecular outflow peak and a cm emission feature indicative of a thermal jet.\nThis spatial displacement between the molecular lines and the mm continuum\nemission could be either due to an unresolved sub-source at the position of the\ncm feature, or the outflow/jet itself alters the chemistry of the core\nenhancing the molecular abundances toward that region. A temperature estimate\nbased on the CH3CN(12_k-11_k) lines suggests temperatures of the order 150K. A\nvelocity analysis of the high-density tracing molecules reveals that at the\ngiven spatial resolution none of them shows any coherent velocity structure\nwhich would be consistent with a rotating disk. We discuss this lack of\nrotation signatures and attribute it to intrinsic difficulties to\nobservationally isolate massive accretion disks from the surrounding dense gas\nenvelopes and the molecular outflows.",

We made also use of\nnewly presented data from the Medicina water maser patrol, started in 1987, to\nstudy the variability of the water masers found in the region. S235A is a\nclassical HII region whose structure is now well resolved. To the south, no\nradio continuum emission is detected either from the compact molecular core or\nfrom the jet-like structure observed at 3.3 mm, suggesting emission from dust\nin both cases. We find two new compact radio continuum sources (VLA-1 and\nVLA-2) and three separate maser spots. VLA-1 coincides with one of the maser\nspots and with a previously identified IR source (M1). VLA-2 lies towards S235B\nand represents the first radio detection from this peculiar nebula that may\nrepresent an ionized wind from a more evolved star. The two other maser spots\ncoincide with an elongated structure previously observed within the molecular\ncore in the C34S line. This structure is perpendicular to a bipolar molecular\noutflow observed in HCO+(1-0) and may trace the associated equatorial disk. The\nSpitzer images reveal a red object towards the molecular core. This is the most\nviable candidate for the embedded source originating the outflow and maser\nphenomenology.

    "summary": "This work deals with the questions of absolute space and relativity. In\nparticular, an alternative derivation of the effects described by special\nrelativity is provided, which is based on a description that assumes a\nprivileged reference frame. The present theory follows the ideas of Lorentz and\nPoincare, abandoning a strict view of Einstein's \"equivalence\" of all inertial\nframes. The meaning of the Principle of Relativity is discussed and elucidated,\nand it is shown that it is not incompatible with the existence of a preferred,\nabsolute, frame. Most scientists nowadays still consider the basic assumptions\nof the theory proposed here to be plain wrong. Moreover, they tend to see an\nirreconcilable conflict between the Lorentz-Poincare and the Einstein-Minkowski\nformulations. However, as stated by John Bell [Bell1988], although there is a\nstringent \"difference in philosophy\" between both views, \"the facts of physics\ndo not oblige us to accept one philosophy rather than the other\". The validity\nof Bell's assertion is unambiguously demonstrated, and it is shown how and why\nboth approaches do indeed agree in the description of (most of?) the physical\nphenomena. Evidently, the physical meaning of the different physical quantities\n- such as \"time\", \"speed\", \"simultaneity\" and \"synchronization\" - is quite\ndifferent in both programmes. And yet, for perplexing it may look at first\nsight, the present theory, developed under the Lorentz-Poincare assumption of a\npreferred reference frame, somehow encompasses Einstein's theory. There is no\nconflict, as there is one theory. It is stressed that reality is not changed by\nthe choices one makes to describe it, so it is not changed by the particular\nway in which the clocks have been set.",

After discussing the quark-mass dependence of the location of such\npoints, the critical behavior of the in-medium meson masses and quark number\ndensity are calculated. The universality classes of the end points are\ndetermined by calculating the critical exponents of the susceptibilities. In\norder to numerically estimate the influence of fluctuations we compare all\nquantities with results from a mean-field approximation. It is concluded that\nthe region in the phase diagram where the susceptibilities are enhanced is more\ncompressed around the critical end point if fluctuations are included.",

Anisotropic pressures arise, and in the tree\napproximation of the magnetic field case, the pressure along $B$ is positive,\nwhereas perpendicular to $B$ it is negative. Due to the common axial symmetry,\nthe formal analogy with the Casimir effect is discussed, for which in addition\nto the usual negative pressure perpendicular to the plates, there is a positive\npressure along the plates. The formal correspondence between the Casimir and\nblack body energy-momentum tensors is analyzed. The fermion hot vacuum behavior\nin a magnetic field is also briefly discussed.",

We find that our model is in general good agreement with\nobservations in the scale/luminosity range where we can trust the predictions.\nThis range is found to be limited (i) by the size of the dark matter simulation\nused -- which introduces finite volume effects at large scales -- and by the\nmass resolution of this simulation -- which introduces incompleteness at\napparent magnitudes fainter than $r\\sim 20$. We then focus on the small scale\nclustering properties of galaxies and investigate the behaviour of three\ndifferent prescriptions for positioning galaxies within haloes of dark matter.\nWe show that galaxies are poor tracers both of DM particles or DM\nsub-structures, within groups and clusters.

    "summary": "We present the latest determination of the X-ray (2-10 keV) AGN luminosity\nfunction accounting for the selection effect due to X-ray absorption. The main\nresults are: 1) the inclusion of obscured AGN confirms the AGN differential\nluminosity evolution, but makes it less extreme than what is found selecting\nunobscured AGN in soft X-rays, and more similar to a pure luminosity evolution;\n2) significant correlations are found between the fraction of obscured sources,\nthe luminosity and the redshift, this fraction increasing toward both low AGN\nluminosities and high redshifts. We discuss our findings in a scenario for the\nformation and evolution of the structure in the Universe where the bulk of\nnuclear activity is produced at z=1-2. At the same redshifts also the\nstar-formation rate reaches a maximum, and this age can therefore be regarded\nas the \"golden age\" for nuclear and galaxy activity. We discuss the current\nobservational limits of this program and the improvements needed to obtain an\nunbiased census of the AGN and super-massive black hole (SMBH) population.",

Rotation curves (RCs) of the gas are extracted from these simulations in\na way that follows the procedure applied to observations of distant, small, and\nfaint galaxies as closely as possible. We show that galaxy-galaxy mergers and\nfly-bys disturb the velocity fields significantly and hence the RCs of the\ninteracting galaxies, leading to asymmetries and distortions in the RCs.\nTypical features of disturbed kinematics are significantly rising or falling\nprofiles in the direction of the companion galaxy and pronounced bumps in the\nRCs. In addition, tidal tails can leave strong imprints on the rotation curve.\nAll these features are observable for intermediate redshift galaxies, on which\nwe focus our investigations. We use a quantitative measure for the asymmetry of\nrotation curves to show that the appearance of these distortions strongly\ndepends on the viewing angle. We also find in this way that the velocity fields\nsettle back into relatively undisturbed equilibrium states after unequal mass\nmergers and fly-bys. About 1 Gyr after the first encounter, the RCs show no\nsevere distortions anymore. These results are consistent with previous\ntheoretical and observational studies. As an illustration of our results, we\ncompare our simulated velocity fields and direct images with rotation curves\nfrom VLT/FORS spectroscopy and ACS images of a cluster at z=0.53 and find\nremarkable similarities.",

In\nthis two-component model, the Milky Way's virial radius and mass are r_vir =\n200 kpc and M_vir = 1.5 x 10^12 M_sun. Still assuming the tracers' velocity\nanisotropy to be constant (at beta=0.5) we again find good agreement with the\nobserved sigma(r), so long as the tracer density is truncated near the virial\nradius.

We study two\ndifferent forms of repulsive confinements, when the interaction potential\nbetween water-wall is (i) $1/r^9$ and (ii) WCA-like repulsive potential.

In previous studies that include attractions,\nfreezing into monolayer or trilayer ice was seen for this wall separation.\nUsing the same separation as these previous studies, we find that the crystal\nstate is not stable with $1/r^9$ repulsive walls but is stable with WCA-like\nrepulsive confinement. However, by carefully adjusting the separation of the\nplates with $1/r^9$ repulsive interactions so that the effective space\navailable to the molecules is the same as that for LJ confinement, we find that\nthe same crystal phases are stable. This result emphasizes the importance of\ncomparing systems only using the same effective confinement, which may differ\nfrom the geometric separation of the confining surfaces.",

Peculiar\nmorphologies and unusually high Halpha emission are associated with two giant\ngalaxies and at least ten dwarfs/extragalactic HII regions, making this group\nthe region with the highest density of star formation activity ever observed in\nthe local clusters. Moreover Halpha imaging observations reveal extraordinary\ncomplex trails of ionized gas behind the galaxies, with projected lengths\nexceeding 150 kpc. These unique cometary trails mark the gaseous trajectory of\ngalaxies, witnessing their dive into the hot cluster intergalactic medium.\nUnder the combined action of tidal forces among group members and the\nram-pressure by the cluster ambient medium, the group galaxies were fragmented\nand the ionized gas was blown out. The properties of this group suggest that\nenvironmental effects within infalling groups may have represented a\npreprocessing step of the galaxy evolution during the high redshift cluster\nassembly phase.",

This commonality is of interest to investigations of\naccretion disk winds (e.g., Murray et al. 1995; Proga et al. 2000) from active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN) as there is evidence that broad absorption line quasars\n(BALQSOs) are drawn from a parent sample of quasars that exhibit larger than\naverage CIV blueshifts, weaker than average CIV emission line strengths, and\nbluer than average (intrinsic) colors. The properties of the absorption troughs\nappear to be dependent upon these parameters.

Accessible\ninformation is extremely difficult to characterize analytically; even bounds on\nit are hard to place. The celebrated Holevo bound states that accessible\ninformation cannot exceed chi(E), the quantum mutual information between the\nrandom variable and its encoding. However, for general ensembles, the gap\nbetween the acc(E) and chi(E) may be arbitrarily large.\n  We consider the special case of a binary random variable, which often serves\nas a stepping stone towards other results in information theory and\ncommunication complexity. We give explicit lower bounds on the the accessible\ninformation acc(E) of an ensemble E = {(p, rho_0), (1-p, rho_1)}, with 0 <= p\n<= 1, as functions of p and chi(E). The bounds are incomparable in the sense\nthat they surpass each other in different parameter regimes.\n  Our bounds arise by measuring the ensemble according to a complete orthogonal\nmeasurement that preserves the fidelity of the states rho_0,rho_1. As an\nintermediate step, therefore, we give new relations between the two quantities\nacc(E), chi(E) and the fidelity B(rho_0,rho_1).",

It is remarked that some\nexperiments had already suggested that the penetrating radiation from beryllium\nhad an electromagnetic component, before Joliot-Curies suggested the beryllium\nradiation consisted of high-energy gamma rays. Joliot-Curies' idea also relied\non the many Compton electron tracks in the Wilson chamber. In 1920, both\nHarkins and Rutherford foresaw the existence of a particle of mass 1 and zero\ncharge, consisting of one proton and one electron, though they did not give any\nname to it. In 1932, the neutron was finally observed by Chadwick. However, the\nquestion whether considering the neutron as a fundamental or a compound\nparticle still bothered the physicists and Chadwick himself for more than one\nyear. Instead, as soon as Majorana heard about Joliot-Curies' experiments he\nguessed the existence of a \"neutral proton.\" In 1933 he published some\n\"corrections\" to Heisenberg's theory. A very simple analysis shows that\nHeisenberg's original version of exchange interactions and Majorana's version\nclearly reflect, respectively, that the nucleus contained \"electrons\" and that\nthe nucleus was free from electrons. The emission of electrons from the nucleus\nstill needed to be accounted for. Fermi's theory of beta-decay settled the\nquestion. Thanks to exchange interactions and beta-decay theory, quantum\nmechanics could now be applied to the nucleus, which could be considered free\nfrom electrons. Also the neutron could be considered free from electrons, and\ntreated as a fundamental particle.",

    "summary": "A great body of research literature pertaining to microburst generation in\nconvective storms has focused on thermodynamic factors of the pre-convective\nenvironment as well as storm morphology as observed by radar imagery. Derived\nproducts based on GOES sounder data have been found to be especially useful in\nthe study of thermodynamic environments. However, addressed much less\nfrequently is the relationship between convective storm electrification,\nlightning phenomenology and downburst generation. Previous research in\nlightning production by convective storms has identified that electrification,\nphenomenology (i.e. flash rate, density), and polarity are dependent upon the\nthermodynamic structure of the ambient atmosphere, especially vertical moisture\nstratification. Thus, relevant parameters to describe the thermodynamic setting\nwould include convective available potential energy (CAPE), due to its\ninfluence on updraft strength, and cloud liquid water content, due to its\nrelationship to precipitation physical processes. It has already been addressed\nthat buoyant energy and moisture stratification are important factors in\nconvective storm development and downburst generation. This research effort\ninvestigates and derives a qualitative relationship between lightning\nphenomenology in convective storms and downburst generation.\nDownburst-producing convective storms will be analyzed by comparing\npre-convective environments, as portrayed by GOES microburst products, storm\nmorphology, as portrayed by radar imagery, and electrical behavior, as\nindicated by NLDN data.",

In appearance, this\naction resembles the Einstein-Hilbert action for vacuum General Relativity: the\nequations of motion for both are second order; the difference is that here the\ndynamical variables are not the metric, but the embedding functions of the\nworldvolume. We provide a novel Hamiltonian formulation for this model. The\nLagrangian, like that of General Relativity, is linear in the acceleration of\nthe extended object. As such, the model is not a genuine higher derivative\ntheory, a fact reflected in the order of the equations of motion. Nevertheless,\nas we will show, it is possible as well as useful to treat it as a `fake'\nhigher derivative system, enlarging the phase space appropriately. The\ncorresponding Hamiltonian on this phase space is constructed: it is a\npolynomial. The complete set of constraints on the phase space is identified.\nThe fact that the equations of motion are of second order in derivatives of the\nfield variables manifests itself in the Hamiltonian formulation through the\nappearance of additional constraints, both primary and secondary. These new\nconstraints are second class. In this formulation, the Lagrange multipliers\nimplementing the primary constraints get identified as accelerations. This is a\ngeneric feature of any Lagrangian linear in the acceleration possessing\nreparametrization invariance.",

This theory supports 1/2-BPS domain walls and flux\ntubes (strings), as well as their 1/4-BPS junctions. The effective\n(2+1)-dimensional theory on the domain wall is known to be a U(1) gauge theory.\nPreviously, the wall-string junctions were shown to play the role of massive\ncharges in this theory. However, the field theory of the junctions on the wall\n(for semi-infinite strings) appears to be inconsistent due to infrared\nproblems. All these problems can be eliminated by compactifying one spatial\ndimension orthogonal to the wall and considering a wall-antiwall system on a\ncylinder. We argue that for certain values of parameters this set-up provides\nan example of a controllable bulk-brane duality in field theory. Dynamics of\nthe 4D bulk are mapped onto 3D boundary theory: 3D N=2 SQED with two matter\nsuperfields and a weak-strong coupling constant relation in 4D and 3D,\nrespectively. The cylinder radius is seen as a \"real mass\" in 3D N=2 SQED. We\nwork out (at weak coupling) the quantum version of the world-volume theory on\nthe walls. Integrating out massive matter (strings in the bulk theory) one\ngenerates a Chern-Simons term on the wall world volume and an interaction\nbetween the wall and antiwall that scales as a power of distance. Vector and\nscalar (classically) massless excitations on the walls develop a mass gap at\nthe quantum level; the long-range interactions disappear. The above duality\nimplies that the wall and its antiwall partner (at strong coupling in the bulk\ntheory) are stabilized at the opposite sides of the cylinder.",

    "summary": "Extinction by intergalactic gray dust introduces a magnitude redshift\ndependent offset in the standard-candle relation of SN Ia. This leads to\noverestimated luminosity distances compared to a dust-free universe.\nQuantifying the amplitude of this systematic effect is crucial for an accurate\ndetermination of the dark energy parameters. In this paper we model the gray\ndust extinction in terms of the star-formation history of the universe and the\nphysical properties of the dust grains. We focus on a class of cosmic dust\nmodels which satisfy current observational constraints. These can produce an\nextinction as large as 0.08 mag at z=1.7 and potentially disrupt the dark\nenergy parameter inference from future SN surveys. In particular depending on\nthe dust model we find that an unaccounted extinction can bias the estimation\nof a constant dark energy equation of state w by shifting its best fit value up\nto 20% from its true value. Near-IR broadband photometry will hardly detect\nthis effect, while the induced decrement of the Balmer lines requires high\nsignal-to-noise spectra. Indeed IR-spectroscopy will be needed for high\nredshift SNe. Cosmic dust extinction may also cause a detectable violation of\nthe distance-duality relation. A more comprehensive knowledge of the physics of\nthe IGM is necessary for an accurate modeling of intergalactic dust. Due to the\nlarge magnitude dispersion current luminosity distance measurements are\ninsensitive to such possible extinction effects. In contrast these must be\ntaken into account if we hope to disclose the true nature of dark energy with\nthe upcoming generation of SN Ia surveys.",

The low\nmass and low metallicity (1/6 solar) of the SMC make it the best local analog\nfor primitive galaxies at high redshift. By studying the properties of dust and\nstar formation in the SMC at high resolution, we can gain understanding of\nsimilar distant galaxies that can only be observed in much less detail. In this\ncontribution, we present a preliminary analysis of the properties of point\nsources detected in the Spitzer Survey of the Small Magellanic Cloud (S^3MC).\nWe find ~400,000 unresolved or marginally resolved sources in our IRAC images,\nand our MIPS 24 micron mosaic contains ~17,000 point sources. Source counts\ndecline rapidly at the longer MIPS wavelengths. We use color-color and\ncolor-magnitude diagrams to investigate the nature of these objects,\ncross-correlate their positions with those of known sources at other\nwavelengths, and show examples of how these data can be used to identify\ninteresting classes of objects such as carbon stars and young stellar objects.\nFor additional examples of some of the questions that can be studied with these\ndata, please see the accompanying contributions by the other members of our\nteam.

Moreover, the partially completed CM systems--in which\ndynamics of particles are continued through collisions--have been identified as\nmeromorphic Hitchin systems, giving natural ``geometric action-angle\nvariables'' for the CM system. Motivated by relations of the CM system to\nnonlinear PDE, we introduce a new class of generalizations of the spin CM\nparticle systems, the framed (rational, trigonometric and elliptic) CM systems.\nWe give two algebro-geometric descriptions of these systems, via meromorphic\nHitchin systems with decorations (framing data) on (cuspidal, nodal and smooth)\ncubic curves and via one-dimensional sheaves on corresponding ``twisted'' ruled\nsurfaces. We also present a simple geometric formulation of the flows of all\nmeromorphic GL_n Hitchin systems (with no regularity assumptions) as tweaking\nflows on spectral sheaves. Using this formulation, we show that all spin and\nframed CM systems are identified with hierarchies of tweaking flows on the\ncorresponding spectral sheaves. This generalizes the well-known description of\nspinless CM systems in terms of tangential covers.",

We confirm many\npreviously reported stellar companions, including six stars in five systems\nthat are recognized for the first time as companions to exoplanet hosts.

At least three, and possibly five, of the\nexoplanet systems reside in triple star systems. Three exoplanet systems have\npotentially close-in stellar companions ~ 20 AU away from the primary.

    "summary": "Quasars trace the most massive structures at high redshifts and their\npresence may influence the evolution of the massive host galaxies. We study the\nextended Lyman alpha emission line regions (EELRs) around seven bright, mostly\nradio-quiet quasars (QSOs) at 2.7<z<4.5, and compare luminosities with EELRs\naround radio-loud QSOs reported in the literature. Using integral field\nspectroscopy, we analyse the morphology and kinematics of the quiescent Lya\nEELRs around the QSOs. We find evidence for the presence of EELRs around four\nradio-quiet and one radio-loud QSO. All EELRs appear asymmetric and the\noptically brightest QSOs also have the brightest Lya nebulae. For the two\nbrightest nebulae we find velocities between ~600 km s^-1 at the QSO position\nto ~200 km s^-1 at a distance of 3-4 arcsec from the QSO and surface flux\ndensities up to 2-3*10^{-16} erg cm^-2 s^-1 arcsec^-2. The five EELRs have\ntotal Lya luminosities which correspond to ~0.5% of the luminosities from the\nQSOs broad Lya emission lines. This fraction is an order of magnitude smaller\nthan found for EELRs around radio-loud, steep spectrum QSOs reported in the\nliterature. While the nebulae luminosities are correlated with the QSO Lya\nluminosities, we find that nebulae luminosities are not correlated with the\ncentral QSO ionising fluxes. The presence of gas in the EELRs can be\ninterpreted based on two competing scenarios: either from quasar feedback\nmechanisms, or from infalling matter. Apart from these two effects, the Lya\nflux around radio-loud objects can be enhanced due to interactions with the\nradio jets. The relatively fainter nebulae around radio-quiet QSOs compared to\nlobe-dominated radio-loud QSOs can be ascribed to this effect, or to\nsignificant differences in the environments between the two classes.",

Our method uses\nobserved superluminal motions and observed brightness temperatures for a large\nsample of AGN to constrain the characteristic intrinsic brightness temperature\nof the sample as a whole. To study changes in intrinsic brightness temperature,\nwe assume that the Doppler factors of individual jets are constant in time as\njustified by their relatively small changes in observed flux density. We find\nthat in their median-low brightness temperature state, the sources in our\nsample have a narrow range of intrinsic brightness temperatures centered on a\ncharacteristic temperature, T_int = 3 x 10^10 K, which is close to the value\nexpected for equipartition, when the energy in the radiating particles equals\nthe energy stored in the magnetic fields. However, in their maximum brightness\nstate, we find that sources in our sample have a characteristic intrinsic\nbrightness temperature greater than 2 x 10^11 K, which is well in excess of the\nequipartition temperature. In this state, we estimate the energy in radiating\nparticles exceeds the energy in the magnetic field by a factor of ~ 10^5. We\nsuggest that the excess of particle energy when sources are in their maximum\nbrightness state is due to injection or acceleration of particles at the base\nof the jet. Our results suggest that the common method of estimating jet\nDoppler factors by using a single measurement of observed brightness\ntemperature and/or the assumption of equipartition may lead to large scatter or\nsystematic errors in the derived values.",

It is envisioned that such a device would have tremendous applicability\nin photonic quantum information proposals where quantum information in the\npolarization qubit is to be protected.",

    "summary": "Imaging surveys with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) have shown that roughly\n50-80% of low- and intermediate-luminosity galaxies contain a compact stellar\nnucleus at their center, regardless of host galaxy morphological type. We\ncombine HST imaging for early-type galaxies from the ACS Virgo Cluster Survey\nwith ground-based long-slit spectra from KPNO to show that the masses of\ncompact stellar nuclei in Virgo Cluster galaxies obey a tight correlation with\nthe masses of the host galaxies. The same correlation is obeyed by the\nsupermassive black holes (SBHs) found in predominantly massive galaxies. The\ncompact stellar nuclei in the Local Group galaxies M33 and NGC205 are also\nfound to fall along this same scaling relation. These results indicate that a\ngeneric by-product of galaxy formation is the creation of a Central Massive\nObject (CMO) -- either a SBH or a compact stellar nucleus -- that contains a\nmean fraction, ~ 0.2%, of the total galactic mass. In galaxies with masses\ngreater than a few times 10^10 solar masses, SBHs appear to be the dominant\nmode of CMO formation.",

    "summary": "We report new experiments that test quantum dynamical predictions of\npolarization squeezing for ultrashort photonic pulses in a birefringent fibre,\nincluding all relevant dissipative effects. This exponentially complex\nmany-body problem is solved by means of a stochastic phase-space method. The\nsqueezing is calculated and compared to experimental data, resulting in\nexcellent quantitative agreement. From the simulations, we identify the\nphysical limits to quantum noise reduction in optical fibres. The research\nrepresents a significant experimental test of first-principles time-domain\nquantum dynamics in a one-dimensional interacting Bose gas coupled to\ndissipative reservoirs.",

Our model predicts that the\nshape of the m-NT characteristics is basically controlled by heat removal\nmechanisms. In particular we show that the onset of negative differential\nresistance in free standing nanotubes finds its origins in strong transport\nnonlinearities associated with poor heat removal unlike in substrate-supported\nnanotubes.",
